ORDINANCE NO. 2025-1305-O
AN ORDINANCE REZONING A CERTAIN PORTION OF WASHINGTON COUNTY LOCATED AT
APPROXIMATELY 300 W 300 S BY CENTRAL FROM THE A-20
ZONE TO THE MINING AND GRAVEL ZONE, HEREINAFTER FULLY DESCRIBED IN THIS
ORDINANCE
(Applicant Bryce Christensen)
 
WHEREAS, the private property owner has requested that the County Commission of
Washington County, State of Utah, rezone certain real property (the "Property")
by removing Parcel No. C-8-A-2-DD-NW,
which total approximately 36.95 acres in size, from the A-20 zone
(Agricultural 20 acre minimum lot size) to the M-G zone 
(Mining and Gravel 20 acre minimum lot size), as represented in Exhibit One;
 
WHEREAS, the applicant proposes to mine cinders on the site through methods of
excavation, extraction, and transportation to an offsite processing yard. The applicant has met
the requirements of the zone change application, and requests a zone change
to the Mining and Gravel zone for the described property;
WHEREAS, the Washington County Planning Commission held a properly noticed
public hearing on this matter on August 12, 2025, in which all interested parties were given the
opportunity to speak regarding the zone change request, which resulted in a motion to table the
public meeting to a date certain, giving the Planning Commission time to
evaluate concerns expressed by members of the public and allowing the Planning
Commission an opportunity to visit
the property. The Planning Commission participated in a public meeting at the property location
on August 19, 2025. Thereafter, the Planning Commission completed the public
meetings on September 9, 2025 at its regular Planning Commission meeting;
WHEREAS, the public hearing was lengthy, and some citizens in the Central area wrote
and spoke for and against the zone change request. Written communications were
forwarded to Planning Commissioners by County staff;
WHEREAS, the Planning Commission found that the applicant’s requested zone change
was appropriate for the property and was compatible with surrounding zoning,
and recommended approval of the zone change from the Agricultural 20 zone to
the Mining and Gravel zone. The roll call vote was five commissioners
recommending approval, and one commissioner recommending denial; one Planning
Commissioner was absent; and
WHEREAS, the County Commission has concluded that it is in the best interest of the
citizens of Washington County that the zone change be accomplished as requested
by the applicant for the following reasons: (1) there is a demonstrated
economic benefit for mining
and gravel operations in the unincorporated county; 
(2) the property location is proximate to an improved roadway, SR-18; (3) the
property is proximate to roadway and construction projects; and (4) the
applicant has the ability to mitigate concerns from local residents regarding
the impact of a Mining and Gravel zone near the Central community by future
implementation of a Mining and Gravel Plan approved by the County. Thus, the
County Commission finds that
the
zone change is compatible with the surrounding area, and appropriate for the property and
surrounding uses and purposes of the land.
NOW, THEREFORE, the legislative body of Washington County ordains as
follows:
 
Section 1. Repealer. Any provision of the Washington County code found to be in conflict
with this Ordinance is hereby repealed.
 
Section 2. Enactment. Applicant’s request to rezone Parcel No. C-8-A-2-DD-NW,
which totals approximately 36.95 acres in size, from the A-20 zone 
(Agricultural 20 acre minimum lot size) to the M-G zone (Mining and Gravel 20
acre minimum lot size), is approved. All findings and
recommendations in the staff report and the record
are hereby adopted. The appropriate Zoning Map shall be amended by removing the
described property from the A-20 zone (Agricultural 20 acre
minimum lot size) and placing approximately 36.95 acres in the M-G zone 
(Mining and Gravel 20 acre minimum lot size).
Section 3. Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance is declared to be invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
 
Section 4. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect on the date executed below, and
upon posting in the manner required by law.
APPROVED AND ADOPTED this 16th day of September, 2025.

county commission in compliance with these rules. The duties of the chair shall
be to conduct county commission and other meetings and to execute documents on
behalf of the county.
   CONSENT AGENDA: A means of expediting routine matters which come before the
county commission for approval, e.g., contract renewal where no terms have been
added, removed, or amended. The consent portion of the agenda is approved by
one nondebatable motion. If any commissioner wishes to remove an item from the
consent portion of the agenda, then that item becomes the first order of
business on the regular agenda.
   COUNTY CLERK: Serves as secretary to the board. He/she is responsible for
preparing the agenda, properly advertising the meeting, recording the meeting,
preparing and maintaining the minutes, and keeping track of all motions and
seconds. He/she also attests to all ordinances passed by the county commission.
   INVITED SPEAKERS: May attend meetings and be called upon by the chair to
present information.

of all motions, and the vote.
   MOTION: The question presented to the board. It must be made by one of the
commissioners who is not the chair and seconded by another commissioner.
   QUORUM: A simple majority of the membership of the board or commission. It
does not include a meeting of two (2) commissioners or board members by
themselves when no action, either formal or informal, is taken on a subject
over which the board members or commissioners have advisory power. A vacant
seat does not count toward determining a quorum.
   REGULAR AGENDA: Second order of business at any meeting, after the consent
agenda. Each issue listed requires a separate motion and is debatable.
   SECOND: A supporting vote by a commissioner not making the motion which
allows the motion to be put forward for debate and vote. The chair may second

If a public hearing has been noticed and if there is anyone in the audience who
wishes to speak to the issue, they shall stand and address the chair after any
invited speakers. The chair shall acknowledge them and ask them to step to the
podium. The audience member will then address the commission with their
concerns, questions, and/or comments. When they are finished, the chair shall
then ask the commissioners if they have any questions for the audience member.
When the questions are finished, or if there are none, the audience member may
then sit down.
   C.   Making A Motion: In order for a board to take any official action on
any subject, a commissioner must make a proposal. The commissioner must be
recognized by the chair as having the right to speak. This is referred to as
"getting the floor".
A proposed motion will not be recognized by the chair until another
commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the
commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion.
After the motion is recognized by the chair, the board may debate the motion,
one commissioner at a time, starting with the commissioner offering the motion.
Commissioners may only speak one at a time.
When there is no further debate, the chair shall then call for a vote. Votes
can be taken by voice, by show of hands, by standing, or by roll call as is

vote to preside over the meeting. In the event that the chair attends the

1-5-1 of this chapter, he/she may ask the chair pro tempore to lead the

through a request for proposals, which shall state the relative importance of
price and other evaluating factors. Public notice of the request for proposals,
describing the position sought and the criteria for the position, shall be

"prequalify" by presenting their State contractor's license, performance bond

previously done, and written permission to contact previous employers, etc.) at
the time they submit their bids.

consultants or professionals, whether or not the determination described in
this section has been made. (Ord. 2018-1113-O, 3-20-2018)

awarded for the purpose of clarifying the offeror's proposal, or obtaining the
best and final offers.
   J.   The contract shall be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal
is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the County, taking into
consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for
proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation.
   K.   The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.

CONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS
SECTION:
1-13-1: Statutory Authority
1-13-2: Purpose Of Provisions
1-13-3: Definition
1-13-4: Guidelines
1-13-5: Analysis
1-13-6: Appeals
1-13-7: Limitations
1-13-8: Legal Action
1-13-1: STATUTORY AUTHORITY:
The statutory authority for enacting this chapter is Utah Code Annotated
section 63-90a-1 et seq., as amended. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-
2003)
1-13-2: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for the county to
assist the county in identifying actions that involve the unconstitutional
taking or damaging of private real property without the payment of just
compensation as required by the constitutions of the United States and of the
state. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-3: DEFINITION:
"Constitutional taking issues" means actions involving the physical or
regulatory taking of private real property by the county that might require
compensation to a private real property owner under:
   A.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United
States;
   B.   Article I, section 22 of the Utah constitution; or
   C.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of
private real property by a governmental entity. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003,
eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-4: GUIDELINES:
The following guidelines shall be considered by the county when taking any
action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real
property. The county should review the following to determine and identify
whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking issues. It
is the policy of the county that no individuals bear burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the community as a whole.
A "yes" answer to any of the following questions could raise the implication of
a taking or damaging of private property for which just compensation may be
required:
      1.   Does the action result in a permanent or inevitably recurring
physical occupation of private property?
      2.   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or
grant an easement to the county without the payment of just compensation?
      3.   Does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent or ongoing
nuisance, originating on county property, that impacts neighboring lands so
that their owners or occupants sustain a special and unreasonable interference
with the quiet enjoyment of their property?
      4.   Does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership
such as the right to reasonable access, the right to light, air and view within
the right of way of an abutting public street, or the right to exclude others
from private property?
      5.   Does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected
and vested right, such as the right to continue a nonconforming use; the right
to have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a
complete application was submitted; legally issued subdivision plat approvals,
building permits or licenses; or other protected property interests?
      6.   Does the action impose a severe economic burden that is
inappropriately unfair when considered in light of: a) the burden placed on the
property owner; b) the nature of the government action and benefit; and c) the
property owner's investment backed expectations?
      7.   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically
viable use of the property in a situation where the proposed use does not
constitute a nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety?
      8.   Does the action limit the use of private property without
substantially advancing a legitimate public interest?
      9.   Has the county failed to demonstrate by an individualized
determination that any conditions, dedications or exactions imposed as a
condition of approval of development applications place only fair and roughly
proportionate burdens on development, offsetting the burdens that the proposed
development places on public utilities, streets and other services, but not
imposing additional burdens on development that the community as a whole should
bear?
      10.   Does the action discriminate against property owners, imposing
restrictions or burdens on one property owner that other similarly situated
property owners do not bear? (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-5: ANALYSIS:
If the county determines that a governmental action involves constitutional
taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed by the county to analyze
the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken. In reviewing the
proposed action, the following factors may be analyzed:
   A.   The affect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the
private property.
   B.   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking.
   C.   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the county's
lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking.
   D.   The cost to the county for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-6: APPEALS:
Any owner of private property whose interest in the property is subject to a
physical or regulatory taking by the county, pursuant to a final and
authoritative decision or action of the county, may appeal the county's
decision or action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the
grounds for the appeal in the county commission's office within thirty (30)
calendar days from the date of the county's decision or action. The county
commission, or its designee, shall hear all evidence regarding the appeal and
render its decision and findings in writing within fourteen (14) days from the
date the appeal was filed. If the county fails to hear and decide the appeal
within fourteen (14) days, the county's decision or action is presumed to be
approved. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-7: LIMITATIONS:
The guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and shall not be construed to
expand nor limit the scope of the county's liability for a constitutional
taking. The county shall have no legal liability to any person, firm or entity
of any nature whatsoever, and a court may not impose liability upon the county
for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or the provisions of
Utah Code Annotated section 63-90a-1 et seq., as amended. (Ord. 2003-826-O, 2-
18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)
1-13-8: LEGAL ACTION:
A property owner's failure to appeal the action of the county does not
constitute, and may not be interpreted as constituting, a failure to exhaust
available administrative remedies or as a bar to bringing legal action. (Ord.
2003-826-O, 2-18-2003, eff. 2-24-2003)

3-4-0: PREAMBLE AND FINDINGS:
Whereas, the planning commission and the county commission have received
evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses on the community presented in public hearings; and
Whereas, the planning commission and the county commission have conducted
extensive review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects
associated with sexually oriented businesses in other cities and counties,
including Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Garden Grove,
California (1991); Los Angeles, California (1977); Whittier, California (1978);
Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Cleveland, Ohio
(1977); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Austin, Texas
(1986); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Houston, Texas (1977); Seattle, Washington
(1989); Dallas, Texas (1997); Newport News, Virginia (1966); Ellicottville, New
York (1998); New Hanover County, North Carolina (1989); St. Croix County,
Wisconsin (1993); Adams County, Colorado (1990); and Manatee County, Florida
(1987); and
Whereas, the planning commission and the county commission have reviewed the
findings incorporated in the cases of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367
(1968), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), Schad v. Borough
of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981), City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,
475 U.S. 41 (1986), City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, et al, 122 S. Ct.
1728 (2002); and
Whereas, the planning commission and the county commission have received public
input at public hearings with regard to the enactment of this chapter; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent
to them, causing among other adverse secondary effects, increased crime and
downgrading of property values; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that crime in areas
surrounding sexually oriented businesses is significantly higher than in like
areas where sexually oriented businesses are not present, which include
significant increases in sex offenses (rape, indecent exposure, lewd and
lascivious behavior and child molestation), violent crimes (rape, murder,
robbery and assault), and property crimes (burglary, larceny and auto theft);
and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that increased crime and
unhealthful conduct tend to accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by
sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, prostitution,
pandering, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession and distribution of
obscene materials and child pornography, possession and sale of controlled
substances, and violent crimes against persons and property; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaison of a casual nature; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that there are adverse harmful
effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of sexually oriented
businesses, deterioration of respect for family values, and people being afraid
to walk in areas where sexually oriented businesses operate, which necessitate
walking around or not visiting in the immediate neighborhood of such
businesses; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that when sexually oriented
businesses operate in the vicinity of churches, churches have had to drive the
elderly to church services to protect them from being exposed to unsavory
persons, and post private guards in their parking lots to keep patrons of
sexually oriented businesses, and people associated with the activities
surrounding the sexually oriented businesses, out of the church parking lots;
and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that the value and
marketability of residential property (single-family and multiple-family
properties), within three (3) blocks of a sexually oriented business, and
commercial property, within three (3) blocks of a sexually oriented business,
are significantly lower than similar properties in areas where sexually
oriented businesses are not present, and that residential locations are
affected more than commercial locations; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that there is a deterioration
in the quality of businesses which choose to operate in and around such
sexually oriented businesses; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when they are operating in close proximity to
each other, thereby contributing to increased crime, lower property values,
urban blight, and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area,
including increased noise, lighting and traffic generated by sexually oriented
businesses, and that the higher the concentration of sexually oriented
businesses, the greater the impact; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that the peak hours of a
sexually oriented business are evening hours, and that the operation of
sexually oriented businesses during late hours is a nuisance to property owners
in close proximity to a sexually oriented business, who use their property
during evening hours by increasing the contact of neighboring property owners
with the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; and
Whereas, the county, consistent with the sale and consumption of alcohol and
outside advertising limitations, finds that restricted hours of operation will
further prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses;
and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that
are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the sexually oriented business
establishments; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that booths in sexually
oriented businesses facilitate anonymous sex acts between patrons, which
facilitate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, that sexually oriented
businesses that do not have clear lines of vision encourage lewd behavior or
sexual contact, and that locked rooms in sexually oriented businesses are used
as fronts for prostitution; and
Whereas, concern over sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, is a
legitimate health concern of the county, which demands reasonable regulations
of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being
of its citizens; and
Whereas, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
business signs are generally larger, more often illuminated and graphic than
other commercial signs, which is out of keeping with neighborhood character and
results in the exposure of minors to inappropriate sexual images; and
Whereas, zoning, licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate.
reasonable means of accountability to ensure the operators of sexually oriented
businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places which
minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation
of such businesses; and
Whereas, location criteria alone will not adequately protect the health, safety
and general welfare of the citizens of the county and thus, certain regulation
with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented businesses is
in the public interest; and
Whereas, requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and past employees will help reduce the
incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments; and
Whereas, the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and
Whereas, it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain information regarding certain employees who may engage in
the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be
witnesses to such activity; and
Whereas, the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted
of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter, and the barring of
such individuals from the management or employees of sexually oriented
businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; and
Whereas, the county desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens of the county, protect its citizens from increased
crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and the
character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses, deter the spread of
urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of
communicable and social diseases; and
Whereas, sexually oriented businesses in the unincorporated areas of the county
require special supervision from public safety and health agencies of the
county in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the
patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the county; and
Whereas, it is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any expression or
expressive conduct or activities protected by the first amendment, but to enact
a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses; and
Whereas, it is not the intent of the planning commission and the county
commission to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials, and
the planning commission and the county commission expect and encourage state
and local enforcement officials to enforce state and local obscenity laws
against such illegal activities in the county. (Ord. 2003-832-O, 5-6-2003)
3-4-1: STATUTORY AUTHORITY:

3-4-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in

the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses
within the unincorporated areas of the county. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to

SECTION:
3-5-1: Definitions
3-5-2: Status Verification Requirement
3-5-3: Enforcement
3-5-1: DEFINITIONS:
In addition to the terms below, this chapter adopts the definitions contained
in section
3-1-1 of this title concerning business licensure.
BUSINESS LICENSE: A county business license issued by the Washington County
clerk-auditor's office.
EMPLOYEE: For purposes of this chapter, any person for whom a business must
complete a U.S. department of homeland security form I-9, employment
eligibility verification ("I-9 form") is an employee.
STATUS VERIFICATION SYSTEM: An online system operated by the U.S. government at
no cost to employers which allows businesses to verify a potential employee's
authorization to be employed under federal law, e.g., E-Verify. (Ord. 2011-
1014-O, 10-18-2011)
3-5-2: STATUS VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:
   A.   Each place of business within the unincorporated areas of Washington

use a current status verification system operated by the U.S. government, e.g.,
E-Verify.
   C.   This chapter shall not be construed to require an employer to take any
action which does conflict, or which the employer in good faith believes would
conflict, with state or federal law.
   D.   This chapter shall be enforced without regard to race, religion,
gender, ethnicity, or national origin.
   E.   If a place of business fails to comply with this chapter, it shall be
ordered to come into compliance. Additionally, its business license shall be
suspended for:
      1.   A span of zero to ten (10) days for the first instance;
      2.   A span of ten (10) to twenty (20) days for the second instance; and
      3.   A span of thirty (30) days to a permanent suspension for a third
instance.
      4.   For a second or third failure to comply, the failure must have
occurred after a decision was issued on the previous instance. In other words,
if a place of business fails to use a status verification system for ten (10)
employees and this evidence is brought before a hearing officer as outlined
below, that failure to comply constitutes a first instance of failure to comply
and not a first, second, third, ...and tenth instances. (Ord. 2011-1014-O, 10-
18-2011)
3-5-3: ENFORCEMENT:

   B.   County Investigation:
      1.   The clerk-auditor's office may request that a place of business show

place of business, if it determines there is some reasonable suspicion that a
place of business is not complying with this chapter, the clerk-auditor's
office shall conduct a more in depth investigation. If, upon completion of the
investigation, the clerk-auditor's office feels there is sufficient evidence of
noncompliance, it shall turn the information over to the Washington County
attorney's office.
      3.   No investigation shall be conducted if based solely on a worker's or
employer's race, religion, gender, ethnicity, and/or national origin.

investigation; and
         c.   Frivolous complaints may result in the complainant being charged
with a class C misdemeanor.

4-1-1: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the following
meanings unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
ABATEMENT: The removal, stoppage, prostration or destruction of that which
causes or constitutes a nuisance, whether by breaking or pulling it down, or
otherwise destroying or effacing it.
JUNK: Any or all worn out, cast off, destroyed or discarded article or material
which is ready for destruction or has been collected and stored for salvage or
conversion to some other use. Any article or material which, unaltered,
unchanged and without further reconditioning, can be used for its original
purpose as readily as when new and shall not be considered "junk".
JUNK CARS: Any used car or motor vehicle not in the process of reconditioning,
which has been abandoned for use as a motor vehicle on a public highway and
which is in unsafe operating condition and shall have remained in such
condition for a period in excess of thirty (30) days; or portions of junk cars,
such as hoods, fenders, radiators, rims, motors, hubcaps, etc., not being
immediately utilized in the repair of a motor vehicle.
NUISANCE: Any item, thing, manner or condition whatsoever that is dangerous to
human life or health, or renders soil, air, water or food impure or
unwholesome.
OWNER: The person, firm or corporation in whose name said premises are listed
in the records of the county recorder's office for Washington County, Utah.
PROPERTY: Any real property, premises, structure or location on which a
nuisance or public nuisance is alleged to exist.
PUBLIC NUISANCE: Any fence, wall, shed, deck, house, garage, building,
structure or any part of any of the aforesaid; or any tree, pole or smokestack;
or any excavation, hole, pit, basement, cellar, sidewalk subspace, dock, wharf
or landing dock; or any lot, land, yard, premises or location which, in its
entirety, or in any part thereof, by reason of the condition in which the same
is found or permitted to be or remain, shall or may endanger the health,
safety, life, limb or property, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience,
discomfort, damage or injury to any one or more individuals in the county, in
any one or more of the following particulars:
   A.   By reason of being a menace, threat and/or hazard to the general health
and safety of the community. Air cannons, noise cannons, propane cannons, or
high-intensity sound alarms ("audio deterrents") used for agricultural or other
purposes are public nuisances if they can be heard beyond the property line of
the subject property where they are utilized. Also, audio deterrents are not
effective because birds or other predators become accustomed to the sound and
return to the site undeterred. Audio deterrents have a direct negative
relationship to public health and safety because they can cause hearing loss,
physical pain, and psychological distress for the adjacent property owners and
the public. There are alternative sound and cost-effective practices to replace
audio deterrents, such as: motion sensors with repellants, decoys, hawk kites,
netting, or reflective tape.
   B.   By reason of being a fire hazard, propane cannons are a public nuisance
due to the high risk of wildfire.
   C.   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy or use on, in, upon, about or
around the aforesaid property.
   D.   By reason of lack of sufficient or adequate maintenance of the
property, and/or being vacant, any of which depreciates the enjoyment and use
of the property in the immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful
to the community in which such property is situated or such condition exists.
RUBBISH: Means and includes wire, chips, shavings, boxes, barrels, rags,
bottles, broken glass, crockery, tin, cast or wooden ware, iron, stumps, tree
trunks, paper circulars, handbills, boots, shoes, ashes, trash, or any similar
waste material. (2004 Code; amd. Ord., 2-18-2025)
4-1-2: REGULATIONS:

Notes
1 1. UCA § 41-22-2 (1953, as amended)
6-1-2: TRUCK AND OTHER TRAFFIC ON KOLOB MOUNTAIN ROAD:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The statutory authority for enacting this section
is Utah Code Annotated sections 17-53-223 and 72-7-408, as amended.
   B.   Purpose Of Provisions: The purpose of this section is to protect
highway foundation, surfaces, and structures on Kolob Mountain Road (aka Kolob
Terrace Road) from damage and deterioration caused by climatic conditions by
restricting the use of certain vehicles during certain times of the year. The
National Park Service closes the road to vehicle traffic from fall to spring
due to weather conditions. The closure begins at Maloney Hill about one mile
from Hop Valley Trailhead. After the road opens, moisture from melting ice and
snow has accumulated under the road surface making it prone to edge failure,
surface damage, sinkage, and other failures. Preventing stress from heavy
vehicles by restricting use on the roadway minimizes road damage and failure
until the subsurface of the road hardens and stabilizes. These regulations do
not apply to National Park Service roadways.
   C.   Prohibition Of Certain Truck Traffic On Kolob Mountain Road: Prohibited
vehicles, dump trucks, cement trucks, and truck tractors carrying or towing
either trailers or semitrailers are prohibited on Kolob Mountain Road from
March 1 to June 30 of each year. Farm trucks, farm tractors, fuel trucks, and
other overweight vehicles must be issued a permit by the County Public Works
Department, after completion of an application and payment of a fee, to access
Kolob Mountain Road during the prohibited dates. Permits will not be issued
until the road is inspected by the Public Works Department and determined to be
traffic-worthy. Vehicles transporting live farm animals only are exempt from
the permit requirements, and date and weight prohibitions, in this paragraph.
   D.   Signs To Be Posted: The Road Department shall erect signs warning of
the road restrictions for the portion of Kolob Mountain Road affected by this
section.
   E.   Permit Application: The County Public Works Department may, upon
receipt of an application and good cause shown and upon payment of a fee, issue
a permit. The County Public Works Department may deny or issue a permit under
this section to protect the highway foundation, surfaces and structures on
Kolob Mountain Road from undue damage by one or more of the following:
      1.   Limiting the number of trips the vehicle may make;
      2.   Establishing time limits within which the vehicle may operate or
move on Kolob Mountain Road;
      3.   Requiring security in the form of a cash escrow or cash bond in
addition to the permit to compensate for any potential damage by the vehicle to
the highway; and
      4.   Otherwise limiting the conditions of operation or movement of the
vehicle.
   F.   Designation of Kolob Mountain Road as Open to Snow Machines, Sleds,
Snowmobiles:
      1.   During the National Park Service closure of Kolob Mountain Road,
within the unincorporated area of Washington County, the road is designated as
open for snow machine, sled, or snowmobile use. The official road closure
period is defined as when the road has been officially closed for the season to
conventional motor vehicle traffic due to snow. This designation does not
include any road under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service, or roads on
private property unless such use is otherwise permitted, or those roads are
part of the county road system.
      2.   When crossing another street or highway, the operator shall come to
a complete stop before crossing, proceed only after yielding the right of way
to oncoming traffic, and proceed by crossing at a right angle.
      3.   Loading or unloading a snow machine, sled, or snowmobile from a
vehicle or trailer shall be done safely and at the nearest practical point of
operation.
      4.   When directed during an emergency by a peace officer or other public
authority, a snow machine, sled, or snowmobile may be used in locations where
the operation of a conventional motor vehicle is impractical.
   G.   Penalty: Any person who violates any restriction imposed by this
section is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor and, upon conviction, subject to
penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code, and may be ordered to pay restitution for any road damage
caused by violating this section. (Ord. 2017-1084-O, 4-18-2017; amd. Ord. 2024-
1248-O, 1-16-2024; Ord. 2024-1260-O, 5-21-2024)
6-1-3: OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES (OHV; ATV; ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES):
   A.   Registration Of Off Highway Vehicle: Unless exempted under section 41-

7-2-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to amend and supersede title 6, chapter 2, "Off
Road Motor Vehicle Limitations Within Red Cliffs Desert Reserve", of this code
and to amend and supersede Washington County ordinance 2007-949-O, which
established the rules and regulations for recreation in the Red Cliffs Desert
Reserve ("ordinance"), hereinafter collectively referred to as "reserve rules",
to include the possibility of assessing reclamation costs for terrain damaged
by the prohibited off road use of a motor vehicle as set forth below. (Ord.
2008-959-O, 4-1-2008)

   A.   The Washington County habitat conservation plan implementation
agreement ("agreement") was signed on February 26, 1996.

county to certain obligations and responsibilities, including furthering the
purposes of and assuring compliance with the terms of the agreement, and
complying with and enforcing the conditions of the incidental take permit.
   C.   The HCP generally guides the types and locations of recreational uses
allowed within the reserve.
   D.   The Washington County public use plan, adopted by the Washington County

and further defined restrictions on recreational uses in the reserve, balancing
recreational access with protection of critical habitat for the desert
tortoise.
   E.   Failure to follow reasonable rules established to protect fragile
Mojave Desert habitat can cause irreparable harm to the habitat and can result
in the unauthorized take of a federally protected species.
   F.   It is in the best interest of the public and the citizens of Washington
County that the proposed changes to this chapter be approved in order that the
reserve rules be clearly established and enforceable. (Ord. 2008-959-O, 4-1-

against the owner or violator’s property as a lien.
   D.   Damage to Others: If the county damages private property, personal
property, or vehicles while performing county duties, it is not responsible for
the damages. The owner is responsible for any damage to its private property,

charges. The county is not responsible for injury or damage to property due to
the removal or impound of the item. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)

SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL
SECTION:
7-4-1:   Snow And Ice Removal Priorities
7-4-2:   Snow And Ice Removal On Private Roads
7-4-3:   Obstructions; Encroachments
7-4-4:   Duty Regarding Hydrants
7-4-5:   Seasonal Road Closures
7-4-6:   Penalties
7-4-1: SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL PRIORITIES:
Snow and ice removal is provided on public roadways based on numerous factors,
including: the type of road, the volume of population served, safety,
reasonable rotation of services, budget limitations, and the availability of
labor, equipment, and materials. Plowing priority is given first to arterial
and collector streets, followed by secondary and residential streets. Many
rural roads, particularly gravel, dirt, natural, or unpaved roads, cannot be
plowed, and snow and ice removal is impractical. Crew safety and potential
damage to equipment also are important factors when prioritizing snow and ice
removal on the many miles of roads in the county. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)
7-4-2: SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL ON PRIVATE ROADS:
It is the duty of every property owners’ association (POA), entity, or property
owner abutting the private road or gaining access via the private road, to
provide regular snow and ice removal for their property and the private roads.
The county will not provide snow or ice removal on private property or private
roads. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)
7-4-3: OBSTRUCTIONS; ENCROACHMENTS:
   A.   Obstructing a Public Road or Right of Way with Snow or Ice. It is
unlawful to place, push, or blow snow or ice from private property or drive
approaches onto the public road or right of way. It is unlawful to place snow
or ice removed from private property or drive approaches in a manner that
causes a hazard to vehicle or pedestrian traffic. If snow or ice is placed in a
manner that violates this provision, the county may cause the removal of the
obstruction, and charge the cost to the property owner or against the adjacent
private property as a lien.
   B.   Storage of Snow or Ice. Each property owner, occupant, lessor, lessee,
agent, entity, association, or private person shall store its snow or ice on
its property or on the property it owns and controls, including any seasonal
accumulation. No snow or ice shall be stored by others on public property, or a
public road or right of way. No snow or ice shall be stored on the property of
another without the express, written permission of the owner. The county is not
responsible for removing accumulated snow from private property or drive
approaches.
   C.   Other Obstruction of the Public Road or Right of Way. It is unlawful to
obstruct the public road or right of way with trash containers or other
personal property. All trash containers or other personal property shall be
removed from the public road or right of way and not interfere with the
county’s snow or ice removal. It is unlawful to park any construction
materials, equipment, vehicles, attachments, or trailers to transport such
items (“personal property or vehicles”) in the public road or right of way in a
manner that obstructs snow or ice removal or in a manner that fails to leave
adequate room for the passage of plows or other equipment. If the county
damages personal property or vehicles during snow or ice removal, it is not
responsible for the damages. The owner is responsible for any damage to its
personal property or vehicles, including any replacement costs or rental
charges. The county is not responsible for injury or damage to personal
property or vehicles due to the removal or impound.
   D.   Damage to County. If county equipment or property is damaged due to
private obstructions in the road or right of way, the owner or violator is
liable to the county for damages, including repair or replacement of county
equipment or property, and the county may charge the cost to the property owner
or against the adjacent private property as a lien. Any person who violates
this section shall be liable for the cost of removal and impound of the item,
including a county administrative fee of $100 for each violation.
   E.   Encroachment of the Public Road or Right of Way. Unless a current
encroachment permit is obtained for a specific permitted activity in the public
road or right of way, it is unlawful for any private person or entity to remove
snow or ice from county roadways. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)
7-4-4: DUTY REGARDING HYDRANTS:
Each owner, occupant, lessor, lessee, agent, entity, association, or private
person with a fire hydrant on its property, or immediately adjacent to its
property, shall mark, uncover, and remove accumulated snow or ice from the
three-foot area surrounding the fire hydrant. Fire hydrants on private roads
shall have a marker, a minimum height of six feet, that extends above the
anticipated depth of accumulated snow or ice. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)

determine the order, priority, and method of snow or removal on all county
roads or rights of way based on all reasonable factors and those set forth in
this chapter. Snow or ice removal by the county will not commence on a roadway
until the road is constructed and officially accepted by the county.
   C.   Unplowed Roads during the Winter Season. Seasonal Roads and Seasonal
Road Areas on the WMR Map will not be plowed or maintained by the county during
the Winter Season defined as November 1st through April 15th. If the Director

later due to significant weather events, it may be altered by notice on the
county website with links on the Public Works page.
   D.   Maintaining the Winter Maintenance Road Map. The Director or designee
shall maintain the WMR Map and post it on the county’s website with links on

A determination of whether the updates are minor or significant is in the
discretion of the Director or designee.
   E.   Seasonal Road Access. By this chapter, any lot, parcel, or development
that obtains access by a Seasonal Road, or that is in a Seasonal Road Area as
set forth on the WMP Map, is on notice that the lot or parcel is accessed by
roads that will not be plowed by the county. The county also may require
Seasonal Road restriction language on any building permit, plat, or by a
recorded deed restriction to the county’s satisfaction, that it will not plow
the public or private access roads to the lot, parcel, or development. It is
the owner, builder, and developer’s responsibility to familiarize themselves
with this chapter and the access limitations to the lot, parcel, or
development.
   F.   Interlocal Cooperation Agreements. The Director or designee shall have
the authority to negotiate interlocal cooperation agreements with other public
entities for the repair, maintenance, or snow removal on public roads or rights
of way, and have such agreements approved and executed in accordance with state
law. (Ord. 2024-1248, 1-16-2024)

8-1-11: EXCESS PAYMENTS:
The following procedure applies when a purchase amount received is in excess of
the taxes, interest, penalties and administrative fee:
   A.   The county shall notify those with a recorded interest in the property
of the excess funds. Notification shall be made by first class and/or certified
mail. For purposes of this section, those with a recorded interest in the
property are those previously identified as having a recorded interest in the
property and previously notified of the tax sale by the clerk/auditor. The
recipients shall have ninety (90) days from the date the notice is mailed to
submit a written claim for a specified amount of the excess proceeds and a
brief legal justification for the claim.
   B.   If only one claim is submitted within the specified time limit, the
county shall pay the amount of the claim or all of the excess funds, whichever
is less, to the claimant.
   C.   If multiple claims are submitted within the specified time limit and
the total amount claimed by all claimants is less than or equal to the total
amount of the excess funds, then the county shall pay the excess funds to the
claimants.
   D.   If no claims are submitted within the specified time limit or if the
claims submitted are less than the total excess funds, then the county shall
deposit the remaining excess funds with the state of Utah as unclaimed property
in the name of the previous recorded owner of record.
   E.   If multiple claims are submitted within the specified time limit and
the total amount claimed by all claimants is greater than the excess proceeds,
then the county shall notify each claimant of the other claims and include the
name, contact information, amount of claim, and brief description of the legal
justification for each claimant. The claimants shall be invited to resolve how
the excess funds should be divided amongst themselves. A time limit of ninety
(90) days shall be placed on these negotiations. If a resolution is reached and
the county is notified of the resolution by all of the claimants in writing,
then the county shall pay the excess funds to the claimants according to the
resolution.
   F.   If there are inadequate funds and the multiple claimants are unable to
reach an agreement as to the distribution of the excess funds, then the county
shall file an action with the 5th district court of Utah which will allow the
claimants to plead their case to the court. The excess funds shall be
distributed as ordered by the court. Alternatively, the county may make an
independent determination of how the excess funds should be distributed if the
county determines that it is clear which claimants have priority in their
claims.
   G.   The county shall determine appropriate fees to cover its costs in
distributing excess funds and this fee, as established by the Washington County
commission, shall be deducted from the funds prior to their being paid out.
   H.   The county may set a minimum amount before the above provisions apply.
If the excess funds are less than the minimum amount, then the county may
notify only the previous owner of record of the property and pay the funds to
that owner if a claim for the funds is made. If no claim is made, the funds
shall be deposited with the state of Utah as unclaimed property in the name of
the previous owner of record. (Ord. 2012-1020-O, 6-19-2012)
8-1-12: TAX DEED:
After the sales are approved by the board of county commissioners, the clerk/
auditor will issue a tax deed pursuant to Utah law. The county clerk/auditor
will only issue the buyer one deed on each property sold. (Ord. 2005-885-O, 8-
23-2005)
8-1-13: CONTESTING BIDS AND SALES:
Any person contesting any action taken in conjunction with the tax sale shall
file a written protest with the Washington County commission within ten (10)
days after the date of the tax sale. The commission will review the submissions
and render a decision based upon that information. The commission will not
grant a hearing to those contesting a bid. (Ord. 2005-885-O, 8-23-2005)
8-1-14: DISCLAIMER ON PROPERTY SOLD:
   A.   All properties sold during the tax sale shall be conveyed by a tax
deed. A tax deed is not a warranty deed and the county makes no representations
as to the title conveyed nor the purchaser's right of possession of the
property. For example, certain entities or persons, including, but not limited
to, agencies or divisions of both the state and federal government, may have
certain rights of redemption. Therefore, buyers of properties at the tax sale
make any purchase at their own risk.
   B.   Similarly, the county makes no warranties or representations as to
whether the property purchased is suitable for building or developing, nor does
the county make any representations that the property complies with applicable
zoning regulations. (Ord. 2005-885-O, 8-23-2005)
8-1-15: GOVERNING LAW:
The collection of delinquent taxes, including tax sales, is governed by Utah
Code Annotated title 59, chapter 2. In the event of a conflict between this
chapter and the laws of the state of Utah, the laws of the state of Utah
prevail. (Ord. 2005-885-O, 8-23-2005)
CHAPTER 2
PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS
SECTION:
8-2-1: Authority And Purpose
8-2-2: Procedure
8-2-3: Criteria
8-2-4: Grandfather Provision
8-2-5: Conflict
8-2-6: Statutes Incorporated
8-2-1: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
The Utah constitution, article XIII, section 3 and Utah Code Annotated 59-2-102
and 59-2-103(2) (1953, as amended) provide that a residential exemption from
property tax of forty five percent (45%) is available for "primary residences".
The Utah legislature enacted Utah Code Annotated section 59-2-103.5 (2002)
establishing procedures for property owners to obtain a tax exemption for
residential property and authorizing the county legislative body to adopt an
ordinance for the allowance of a residential property tax exemption. (Ord.
2013-1030-O, 7-2-2013)
8-2-2: PROCEDURE:
   A.   No later than sixty (60) days after either a change in ownership or a
change in use of the residence, all owners of residential property as defined
in Utah Code Annotated 59-2-102 (1953, as amended) shall sign and submit a form
supplied by the county, to the board of equalization in care of the Washington
County assessor, stating the current use of the property as primary or
secondary. The application shall include the following information:
      1.   The owner of record of the property;
      2.   Property parcel number;
      3.   Location of the property (address);
      4.   Name of the applicant;
      5.   Basis of the applicant's knowledge of the use of the property;
      6.   Description of the use of the property;
      7.   Evidence of domicile of the inhabitant(s) of the property; and
      8.   Signature(s) of all owners of the property and a certification that
the property is residential property.
   B.   In order to be considered for a primary residential exemption for the
current tax year, the property must be used in the current calendar year as a
primary residence for at least one hundred eighty three (183) consecutive days.
   C.   Applications seeking the exemption for the current tax year and filed
after September 15 must pay an administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) to
the office of the county assessor.
   D.   Except for those properties receiving a residential exemption, which
are required to file an application each year, the county board of equalization
may require an owner of the residential property to file the application
described in subsection A of this section only if:
      1.   That residential property was ineligible for the primary residence
tax exemption during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year
for which the owner is seeking to claim the exemption; or
      2.   The ownership interest in that residential property changes; or
      3.   The county board of equalization or the county assessor determines
that there is reason to believe that the property no longer qualifies for the
residential exemption in accordance with Utah Code Annotated 59-2-103.
   E.   The county board of equalization or the county assessor may request or
collect information sufficient to verify the primary residence status of the
property to determine if the property is entitled to the residential exemption,
pursuant to the criteria set forth in the rules promulgated by the Utah state
tax commission.
   F.   If an applicant requests a property be designated as a primary
residence, the residential exemption shall not be granted without clear and
convincing evidence that the property serves as the primary residence. The
burden of proof shall remain at all times with the applicant.
   G.   After review of the applicant's application, the county assessor shall
make a preliminary determination of whether the requirements for a residential
residence exemption, outlined in Utah Code Annotated section 59-2-103.5(1),
have been met, and whether the factors or objective evidence determinative of
domicile, which are defined and outlined in section
8-2-3 of this chapter, are sufficient to approve the applicant's request. The
county assessor shall then make a recommendation to the board of equalization
for approval or denial of the applicant's request. The board of equalization
shall allow an owner a residential exemption for the residential property
described in the application, upon making a determination that the requirements
outlined in Utah Code Annotated section 59-2-103.5(1), have been met, and that
the factors or objective evidence supplied by the applicant are sufficient to
make a determination of domicile. (Ord. 2013-1030-O, 7-2-2013; amd. Ord. 2021-
1175-O, 4-20-2021)
8-2-3: CRITERIA:
   A.   Definitions:
    DOMICILE: The place where an individual has a true, fixed, permanent home
and principal establishment, and to which place the person has (whenever the
person is absent) the intention of returning. It is the place in which a person
has voluntarily fixed the habitation of the person and the person's family, not
for a mere special or temporary purpose, but with the present intention of
making a permanent home.
      1.   After domicile has been established, two (2) things are necessary to
create a new domicile: first, an abandonment of the old domicile; and second,
the intention and establishment of a new domicile.
      2.   The mere intention to abandon a domicile once established is not of
itself sufficient to create a new domicile; for before a person can be said to
have changed a person's domicile, a new domicile must be shown.
      3.   The assessor and the board of equalization may refer to the
administrative rules of the Utah state tax commission for guidance in reviewing
the factors and evidence determinative of domicile.
   PRIMARY RESIDENCE: The location where domicile has been established.
   B.   Residential Exemption: To qualify for the residential exemption, a
property need not be owner occupied. Apartments and other rental housing used
as a primary residence of the occupant(s) qualify for the residential exemption
in accordance with section
8-2-2 of this chapter. A primary residence does not include property used for
transient residential use, or condominiums used in rental pools. Only the
primary residence, which is occupied more than six (6) months out of the year,
qualifies for the residential exemption. The residential exemption is limited
to up to one acre of land per residential dwelling unit on a single property
description.
   C.   Partial Exemption For Mixed Commercial And Residential: A partial
exemption may be applied against the property taxes of mixed commercial and
residential property but it is presumed that the entire property is commercial.
This presumption may be rebutted by the filing of the application referred to
in subsection 8-2-2A of this chapter every year, which includes evidence of
domicile of each qualifying resident. The county assessor may require
additional information as necessary to make a determination of the percentage
of the property qualifying for the residential exemption.
   D.   Partial Exemption For Nursing Homes: A partial exemption may be applied
against the property taxes of qualifying nursing homes. In addition to the
information required in subsection 8-2-2A of this chapter, the application,
which must be filed every year, shall include the number of residents living at
the facility and the number that have established their primary residence at
the facility; the total square footage of the facility and the total
nonresidential square footage. The county assessor may require additional
information as necessary in order to determine the percentage of eligibility of
the property for the exemption. (Ord. 2013-1030-O, 7-2-2013)
8-2-4: GRANDFATHER PROVISION:
As of the effective date hereof, owner occupied residential property,
apartments and other rental property being used as the primary residence of the
occupants, where the property is currently listed by the county assessor as
having a residential exemption shall not be required to file an application to
continue its status. Owner occupied residential property, apartments and other
rental property being used as the primary residence of the occupants, where the
property is subsequently listed by the county assessor as having a residential
exemption and was constructed after the effective date hereof, shall be
required to file the application required by subsection 8-2-2A of this chapter.
However, should use change from primary residence, the property shall no longer
be considered exempt and an application under the provision of this chapter
shall be required. (Ord. 2013-1030-O, 7-2-2013)
8-2-5: CONFLICT:
In the event of any conflict between this chapter and state or federal law, the
provisions of the latter shall be controlling. (Ord. 2013-1030-O, 7-2-2013)
8-2-6: STATUTES INCORPORATED:
This chapter shall incorporate the provisions of the administrative rules

   A.   Much of Washington County is critical habitat for the Mojave Desert
Tortoise, which is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species
Act of 1973.
   B.   To mitigate impacts to the Mojave Desert Tortoise habitat the Habitat
Conservation Plan was established in 1995 and later restated and amended in
2020.
   C.   The Habitat Conservation Plan is required by the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service for Washington County’s Incidental Take Permit No. TE036719.
   D.   The Habitat Conservation Plan and the Incidental Take Permit resolves
conflicts with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and permit growth,
development, and other covered activities to occur in the Mojave Desert
Tortoise habitat of Washington County.
   E.   The Habitat Conservation Plan established the Red Cliffs Desert
Reserve, a large area of land approximately 69,000 acres in size, which is the
primary conservation measure to offset the impacts allowed under the Incidental
Take Permit.
   F.   An environmental mitigation impact fee is necessary to finance the
Washington County Habitat Conservation Plan, including the management and
monitoring of actions and activities within the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and
provides other environmental protections throughout the County.
   G.   The environmental mitigation impact fee imposed herein bears a
reasonable relationship to the administration and finance of the required
Habitat Conservation Plan. (Ord. 2024-1249-O, 2-6-2024)
9-2A-2: ESTABLISHED:

hearing is not a public meeting or hearing.
      8.   Outside of the hearing, the parties or their representatives shall
not discuss substantive matters pertaining to a pending appeal with the hearing
officer in an effort to influence the decision on the matter. It is not a
violation of this section to speak with the hearing officer about general or
procedural matters not related to the substance of the appeal, which include
but are not limited to the date, time, or place of the hearing.
      9.   The hearing is intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of
evidence and civil procedure, including discovery, do not apply. The Utah rules
of civil procedure and evidence shall be used as guidelines but shall not be
binding. The hearing officer may consider any relevant, nonprivileged oral or
documentary evidence presented.
      10.   If the appellant fails to appear at the hearing, without good
cause, the failure shall be deemed a withdrawal of the appeal and a waiver of
any appeal rights.
      11.   The hearing officer shall make written findings of fact,
conclusions of law, and a final decision. The decision may affirm or reverse,
in whole or in part, the decision being appealed. The written decision shall be
issued within thirty days of the final hearing, and the community development
department shall notify the parties of the decision by mail and email.
      12.   If the hearing officer affirms the administrative decision of the
county, the original final administrative decision shall remain in effect. If
the hearing officer re-verses the decision, in whole or in part, the final
administrative decision will be adjusted accordingly.
      13.   The hearing officer shall cause a record of its proceedings to be
kept, including a record of all evidence, documents, decisions, and an audio
recording of oral arguments and testimony presented at the hearing. The hearing
officer shall transmit the record to the community development department to be
retained for sixty (60) days. If the hearing officer's decision is appealed to
district court, the record will become the entire record transmitted to, and
considered by, the district court. No additional information, evidence, or
theories of relief shall be presented to the district court.
      14.   The decision of the hearing officer is effective on the date of the
written decision, and it constitutes a final decision under Utah Code Ann.§ 17-
27a-801. Any appeal to the District Court shall be within thirty (30) days of
the date of the written decision.
      15.   Filing a petition with the district court does not stay the
decision of the hearing officer absent county agreement or a court order.
   B.   Land Use Decision Appeals, Additional Procedures:
      1.   Only a final decision in which the land use authority has applied a
land use regulation to a particular application, person, or parcel may be
appealed to a hearing officer.
      2.   At all times, the appellant bears the burden of proof that the land
use authority's decision was in error.
         a.   The administrative decision is presumed correct, unless there is
substantial evidence that an error in the application or interpretation of the
land use ordinance occurred.
         b.   For legal issues, the hearing officer shall apply a correctness
standard to its review, and determine if the land use authority correctly
applied the plain meaning of the land use regulation.
         c.   For factual issues, the hearing officer shall examine the facts
on the record and determine if the record on appeal includes substantial
evidence for each essential finding of fact.
         d.   An administrative decision shall not be disturbed if there is
substantial evidence in the record that discloses a reasonable basis for the
decision. Inasmuch as land use authorities and administrative officials have
specialized knowledge in the field of planning and land use, their decisions
should be disturbed only if the hearing officer determines that the decision
was not supported by substantial evidence, or the decision was arbitrary,
capricious or illegal.
         e.   For affirmative defenses, the burden of proof shall be on the
person raising the defense.
      3.   The hearing officer shall:
         a.   Determine the correctness of the land use authority's
interpretation and application of the plain meaning of the land use
regulations; and
         b.   Interpret and apply a land use regulation to favor a land use
application un-less the land use regulation plainly restricts the land use
application.
   C.   Variance Decision Appeals, Additional Procedures:
      1.   Criteria: The hearing officer shall grant a variance only if:
         a.   Literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause an
unreasonable hardship for the appellant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of the zoning ordinance;
         b.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
         c.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zone;
         d.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and
will not be contrary to the public interest; and
         e.   The spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial
justice is done.
      2.   Unreasonable Hardship: In determining whether enforcement of the
zoning ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under this subsection, the
hearing officer may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged
hardship:
         a.   Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
         b.   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood; and
         c.   Is not self-imposed or economic.
      3.   Special Circumstances: The hearing officer may find that special
circumstances exist only if the special circumstance:
         a.   Relates to the hardship complained of; and
         b.   Deprives the property of privileges granted to other properties
in the same zone.
      4.   The appellant bears the burden of proving that all of the
requirements justifying a variance have been met.
      5.   The hearing officer may not grant a use variance.
      6.   The hearing officer's written decision shall include any conditions
of approval it determines are reasonable and necessary to mitigate the impact
of granting a variance.
      7.   A variance "runs with the land."
      8.   A variance shall expire if the appellant fails to obtain a building
permit within one (1) year from the date of the decision or fails to complete
the construction authorized by the variance according to the terms of the
building permit.
   D.   Building Department, Building Official or Fee Appeals, Additional
Procedures:
      1.   Pursuant to Utah Code Ann.§ 17-27a-509, and Titles 9 and 10 of this
code, the county hereby establishes an appeal process for all such fees.
      2.   At all times, the appellant bears the burden of proof, by
substantial evidence, that the land use authority's fee was in error.
      3.   The hearing officer may affirm or decrease the fee amount upon
findings of fact and conclusions of law in its written decision.
   E.   Judicial Review: Any interested party adversely affected by the hearing
officer's decision may file, within thirty days of the written decision, a
petition in the district court for a re-view of decision. The record on appeal
to the district court shall be the record that was created by the hearing
officer, and at the appeal hearing, and transmitted to the community
development department. The right to petition the district court for review is
lost if the petition is filed more than thirty days after the decision. The
standard for the review shall be the standard provided in Utah Code Ann. § 17-
27a-801. The appellant shall not present any information, evidence or theory of
relief that was not presented at the appeal hearing. (Ord. 2022-1205-O, 3-15-

ZONES
SECTION:
10-5-1: Purpose
10-5-2: Boundaries
10-5-3: Zone Requirements
10-5-1: PURPOSE:
For the purpose of this title, the following zones are created to be applied as
necessary to regulate the development of the land in the county. Any use of
land that is not plainly designated as a permitted use in the zone is
prohibited. A specific land use category supersedes one that is more general or
broader in scope. For example, if a land use has been specified (e.g.,
drycleaners) in this title, and it has not been listed as a permitted use in a
zone, it is prohibited in the zone, even if a use that is more general or
broader in scope is permitted (e.g., general commercial) in the zone.
Regardless of the zone, the county hereby reserves all rights to its claimed
public access and R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. The county does not enforce private
restrictive covenants, nor shall any such covenant modify the regulations
herein. (Ord. 2001-815-O, 12-17-2001, eff. 12-17-2001; amd. Ord. 2021-1196-O,
10-5-2021; Ord. 2022-1205-O, 3-15-2022; Ord. 2022-1223-O, 12-20-2022; Ord.
2024-1251-O, 2-25-2024)
10-5-2: BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on county
maps, the following shall apply:
   A.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, waterways, roads, etc., shall be construed to follow such
centerlines and in the event of change in the centerline, shall be construed as
moving with the centerline.
   B.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed to follow such lot lines.
   C.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in subsections A and B of this section shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the official map shall be determined by the scale of
the map.
   D.   Boundaries of each of the said zones are hereby established as
described herein or as shown on the map entitled zoning map of Washington
County, which map is on file in the county offices and all boundaries shown
thereon are made by this reference as much a part of this title as if fully
described and detailed herein. (Ord. 2001-815-O, 12-17-2001, eff. 12-17-2001;
amd. Ord. 2024-1251-O, 2-25-2024)
10-5-3: ZONE REQUIREMENTS:
Each zone change requested by an applicant, seeking a change from a less dense
zone to a denser zone, shall provide proof of all required utilities and
access. No zone change application will be processed or granted without meeting
said utility and access requirements. Some areas of the county are not suitable
for some zones due to scarcity of utilities, lack of access, or lack of
compatibility of the land for the requested zone. Required proof of utilities
and access shall be submitted to, and approved by, the county prior to zone
change approval, with all letters, applications, studies, plans, contract terms
and conditions, acceptable to the county in its sole discretion. Sections A, B,
C, and D shall not apply to a zone change where the sole purpose is to bring a
nonconforming lot or parcel with an existing single family dwelling into
conformity with the required lot or parcel size. Section E, below, applies to
all zone changes. Specific additional requirements:
   A.   Water: Proof of sufficient water rights, quantity, quality and source,
contractually allocating wet water to the development property, to match the
State Division of Drinking Water requirements needed for the proposed zone.
Proof includes the following:
      1.   A will-serve letter from the Washington County Water Conservancy
District, or the other applicable water company or district, establishing
perpetual access to a sufficient quantity and quality of water for the base
density in the requested zone; or
      2.   A feasibility study, prepared by a licensed professional engineer
experienced in hydrology and water resources, with a letter from the Department
of Environmental Quality approving the feasibility study, or
      3.   Application and approval by the Utah State Engineer of the owner's
Application for Permanent Change (Change Application), granting a change in the
point of diversion, the place of use, and the nature of the water right, and
matching the proposed use to the zone change location.
   B.   Sewer/Septic: The requested zone shall meet or exceed the septic
density requirements for the development property based on the applicable,
location-specific study regarding septic densities and septic system types.
Alternatively, a proposal and feasibility study for a community wastewater
system that is adequate in size, capacity, and specifications to reduce
contaminants to acceptable levels. A letter from Washington County Water
Conservancy District, Ash Creek Special Service District, or other applicable
company or district, is required to confirm that the requested zone matches the
requirements in the location-specific study, or requirements in the feasibility
study if accepted by the county. Also, a letter confirming feasibility from
Utah Department of Environmental Quality or the Southwest Utah Public Health
Department, whichever agency is applicable, is required.
   C.   Fire: Submit a fire protection plan to the county and applicable fire
district, to show the requested zone can achieve compliance with fire safety
requirements and the Utah 2006 Wildland Urban Interface Code, as amended. The
plan shall be based on a site-specific wildfire risk assessment that includes
the zone change location, topography, aspect, flammable vegetation, climatic
conditions and fire history. The plan also shall address water supply, access,
fire ignition and resistance factors for the proposed density in the zone, as
well as fire protection systems and equipment, defensible space and vegetation
management. The fire protection plan shall meet all requirements of the
county's Chief Building Official.
   D.   Power: A will serve letter from the applicable power company shall be
submitted prior to the zone change, or submit and obtain an approved
alternative energy plan from the county.
   E.   Access: Submit a rendering showing all public and private roadway
accesses to and from the lot or parcel. A zone change shall not be approved
unless the applicant shows direct access to a dedicated public street, or a
private street approved by the county. A recorded easement in lieu of such
street access may be approved in county's sole discretion, with a minimum width
of twenty-five feet (25'), and it shall only serve up to two lots or parcels
with the right to a single family residence and an ADU on each lot or parcel
only. Any such easement in lieu shall be perpetual and not revocable without
the written consent of the county. All commercial, manufacturing, or industrial
development shall have direct public roadway access, minimum frontage
requirement of one hundred and forty feet (140'); access shall not be provided
by an easement. Any zone change, if granted, does not affect, and shall not
impair, encroach or interfere with the county's claimed public access and R.S.
2477 rights-of-way. The county hereby reserves all access rights, through the
lot or parcel that is the subject of a zone change, to lots, parcels, and
public lands beyond the requested zone change property. Future development on a
lot or parcel that is No the subject of a zone change shall not impair,
encroach, or interfere with the county's claimed public access or R.S. 2477
rights-of-way. (Ord. 2022-1025-O, 3-15-2022; amd. Ord. 2022-1223-O, 12-20-2022;

10-7B-1: PURPOSE:
The Agriculture Estate Overlay Zone may be requested by the owner only for
property zoned A-20 (Agricultural 20 acre minimum lot size), or A-40
(Agricultural 40 acre minimum lot size), where the lot or parcel size matches
or exceeds the minimum acreage for the zone. Agriculture is the primary land
use for this overlay zone. The purpose of the zone is to promote local
agriculture, working farms, and multigenerational agriculture operations by
adding flexibility to some regulations while maintaining agriculture land for
agriculture production. It is not to promote tourist, corporate, recreational
or event uses inside agriculture zones that undermine the viability of
agricultural operations.
(Ord. 2022-2015, 8-2-2022)
10-7B-2: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
An owner may request a zone change from A-20 or A-40 to the Agriculture Estate
Overlay Zone. The applicant shall demonstrate that the zone change is justified
to preserve land for permanent agricultural use by providing supplemental
standards requested by the property owner that replace some of the standards of
the underlying A-20 zone or A-40 zone. The self-imposed overlay zone shall be
requested by the owner, considered by the planning commission, and determined
by the county commission as the land use authority. The planning commission may
recommend approval, modified approval, or denial of the zone change request.
The owner shall provide substantial information to show that the supplemental
standards it requests only impact certain requirements of the underlying A-20
zone or A-40 zone, and that any negative impacts of the requested replacement
standards have been mitigated through superior site layout, building materials,
and design as proposed by the owner.

   A.   Any major revisions or amendments to the existing zone shall subject
the plans to review based upon all the requirements and provisions of this
chapter.
   B.   Planned development zones previously approved under this chapter shall
meet development standards in place at the time of approval. All subsequent
planned development zones shall meet the development standards herein, and
construction standards in place at the time of construction. (Ord. 2010-991-O,
2-16-2010; amd. Ord. 2019-1149-O, 12-3-2019; Ord. 2024-1251-O, 2-25-2024)
10-9-4: GENERAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
All planned developments shall meet the following standards and other
requirements as set forth:
   A.   Permitted Uses: All uses must be approved in conjunction with the
project plan and in accordance with the use chart approved as part of the PD.
If requested zone change is to PDC, in addition to any approved use chart all
uses must be in accordance with the Use Matrix in section
10-10-2.
   B.   General Standards And Requirements:
      1.   Preservation Of Features: The development shall be compatible with
the existing topography of the land and shall reserve unusual topography and
natural features. Requests to waive this standard must be accompanied by a
professionally prepared feasibility report indicating why the proposed
development is a significant county need that transcends the need to preserve
the topography and/or other features.
      2.   Land Disturbance After Concept Plan Submittal But Prior To Project
Plan Approval: No alteration or disturbance of land in a planned development
zone, or the natural, or cultural resources thereon, shall be permitted until
the zone change, complete project plan, and construction drawings have received
approval from the county. Any subsequent land disturbance must be consistent
with the approval granted by the county commission.
      3.   Subdivision Regulations: Land within a planned development, or a
phase of a planned development, shall be treated as a subdivision and thus
subject to the provisions of the county subdivision ordinance.
      4.   Interconnectivity Of Land Use/Phases: Each phase of the project
shall not be isolated from adjacent land development and connection to future
development shall be identified and maintained. Each phase of the project shall
be served by at least one (1) adequate dedicated public roadway that connects
to all adjacent phases or land use areas. If the project has more than fifty
(50) units, the overall project must contain a minimum of two (2) public
roadway accesses. Any deviation from these required two (2) primary accesses
must be recommended by the land use authority and approved by the county
commission and only if the unit count is seventy-five (75) units or less.
      5.   Calculation Of Density: Land uses for open space, common areas, and
interior streets, drives, sidewalks and other circulation ways may be included
as part of the density calculation. The amount of land characterized by
floodway, steep slopes (as defined by the county hillside ordinance), wetlands,
unstable soils, or other unbuildable or sensitive lands may not be included as
a part of the land area for density calculations. However, twenty percent (20%)
of the unbuildable land area may be applied to the buildable portion of the
property through density transfer to increase the net density of the project.
Within phases, density for a specific phase may not exceed that permitted in
the project plan for that phase, and the overall density for the project at all
times must be less than or equal to the allowable maximum density.
      6.   Streets And Public Infrastructure: Water, sewer, street, electric,
and other required infrastructure shall be provided according to the
requirements of the county subdivision ordinance and county construction and
design standards. Exceptions to the county standards and subdivision
requirements related exclusively to roadway design standards and layout must be
supported by appropriate engineering studies and approved by the county
commission pursuant to its approval of the project plan, and shall control and
regulate the development and construction within the project as guidelines and
standards specific to the project. This provision does not alter the public
access requirements above. The following infrastructure requirements are
required as a part of all PD developments.
         a.   Design Of Streets: The design of streets is subject to
recommendation by the land use authority and approval by the county commission,
which may require or allow modifications to the location, layout, or capacity
of roads, or attach additional requirements such as turn lanes, traffic
circles, wider or narrower right-of-way; pavement widths, medians, traffic
calming features, etc., and provided that such modifications meet generally
accepted traffic engineering and planning principles that can be justified by
the applicant (as may be done via traffic engineering studies) and verified by
the land use authority. The county may retain independent traffic engineering
professionals under its control and supervision to verify or modify the
applicant's proposed street designs, at the applicant's expense.
         b.   Interior Streets: Interior streets and roads will be owned and
maintained by the county unless otherwise recommended by the land use authority
and approved by the county commission. Prior to any agreement by the county to
own or maintain streets, streets must meet the county specifications and must
be approved by the county public works department.
         c.   A traffic study must be submitted for any commercial project, and
for every residential project that has over ten (10) dwelling units. The
traffic study shall address all potential impacts, including but not limited
to, modifications needed to intersections of roads leading to the project,

and percentage of each component of the project.
         e.   Indicate the number of residential and/or recreational units and/
or square footage of floor area of nonresidential uses by type of use.
         f.   Indicate the density of uses within each land use component or
phase, using units per acre for residential or recreational development, and
floor area ratio for nonresidential components. For hospitality or PD-STR units
indicate occupancy limits.
         g.   Show a proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan
including entrances and exits and connections to vehicular and pedestrian
facilities external to the project.
         h.   Show existing natural features of the site including rivers,
lakes, ponds, streams, wetlands, steep slopes, mature trees, and tree stands.
         i.   Topography shall be shown at contour intervals of two feet (2')
unless otherwise exempted by the public works director.
         j.   Show where proposed open space will be provided, delineated by
what type of open space it includes (i.e., landscaping area, natural area,
trails, trailheads, adjacent public open space, site furniture, pavilion,
etc.). Calculate the square footage or acreage of each different area in the
written report. Include this as percentage of the total project area. Indicate
any open space that may have limited accessibility such as a golf course or
drainage detention basin.
         k.   Indicate location of landscaping as required herein, buffers, and
a proposed lighting plan.
         l.   Typical elevations.
      2.   Development Agreement: A draft development agreement must be
submitted with the project plan for review by planning staff and the planning
commission.
   C.   Phase Plan: Most planned developments will consist of a project plan
identifying a number of areas of the site with unique or individual land use
types. Each phase shall require separate preliminary and final plat approval
using the procedures set forth in title 11 for the type of use in each phase.
Phase plans must be submitted with the project plan and zone change. The phase
plan must be consistent with the project plan and shall meet all requirements
of the subdivision ordinance for a preliminary plat.
      1.   Preparation Of Phase Plan: The phase plan shall be prepared by a
registered land surveyor, or engineer and meet all requirements equivalent to a
preliminary plat.
      2.   Submittal Of Phase Plan: After a phase plan is submitted and the
staff has determined that all of the necessary information has been submitted,
the plan shall be placed on the next available land use authority agenda to be
reviewed with the project plan and zone change. If the project is to be
developed in more than one phase, each phase of the development shall be
submitted for separate preliminary and final plat approval.
   D.   Rezoning: The zone change request to the applicable PD (Planned
Development) zone and required public hearing take place in conjunction with
the review of the completed project plan and phase plan. The applicant shall
submit a zone change application requesting a zone change to a planned
development zone. The project plan shall be reviewed by staff and discussed in
an informal meeting with the applicant to examine potential areas of
nonconformity. Staff, upon review of the plan, will determine whether the
project meets the intent of the PD zone and includes the required elements.
Staff may reject the project plan and notify the applicant of any deficiencies
so corrections may be made. However, should the plan meet the intent and
contain the required elements, staff will accept the project plan and provide
the applicant with suggestions for changes and modifications, if any, that will
prepare the applicant for the submittal to the recommending body and land use
authority. If the project is of such size that it is considered in one phase
for subdivision, the staff will also review the project plan for conformity
with the preliminary plat requirements of the subdivision ordinance. While the
applicant may request more than one review of the project, one project plan
review, in the form of an advertised public hearing is mandatory. For a PD zone
change or PD amendment. the planning commission is the recommending body to the
county commission.
      1.   Planning Commission Review Of The Project Plan, Development
Agreement, Phase Plan, And Zoning Application: After staff officially accepts
the project plan (completed application and full review by the staff) the
project plan will be properly noticed for the required public hearing and will
be placed on the next scheduled planning commission agenda in which the
noticing requirement can be met. The planning commission will review the
project plan and make a recommendation on the project plan and the rezoning of
the property to the county commission. The planning commission will review the
project plan to county standards and this title and will consider the
following:
         a.   How the proposed project plan meets the purpose of a planned
development;
         b.   The overall project density as well as the density of land use
components, land use mix and percentages; and
         c.   General vehicular and pedestrian circulation including the
location and capacity of the facilities and connections internally and
externally, and open space type, amount, and location.
      2.   County Commission Review Of The Project Plan, Development Agreement,
Phase Plan, And Zoning Application: Upon receiving a recommendation from the
planning commission and before enacting an amendment to the land use ordinance
(zone change), the project plan shall be presented before the county
commission. Phase plans will then be developed according to the project plan of
the applicant. The project plan and the zone change to a PD zone must be
approved concurrently.
   E.   Site Plan: The site plan shows the development plan for individual
building sites within a specific phase. If there is to be only one phase to the
project, and all buildings are to be located on one legal parcel, a single site
plan for the entire project will be permitted.
      1.   Site plans must meet all of the requirements for site plan review,
which includes all requirements from the subdivision ordinance that may be
necessary in order to properly process the request.
      2.   Single-family residential lots are not required to submit a site
plan for land use authority review; however a site plan will be needed for a
building permit. This does not apply to a PD-STR project.
      3.   Site plans for commercial or multi-family residential lots shall be
submitted to the land use authority for individual parcels within a phase. More
than one building may be contained on an individual parcel. Site plans must
also contain the following items:
         a.   Landscape plans;
         b.   Location of all buildings; and
         c.   Typical elevations.
   F.   Construction Drawings And Required Studies: Following the approval of
the project plan and zone change by the land use authority, the applicant shall
submit two (2) sets of paper construction drawings and one (1) electronic copy
(PDF) to the community development department, along with all studies and
reports required by the county standard specifications for design and
construction. Construction drawings and all required studies and reports will
be reviewed for compliance. Once approved, three (3) finalized copies twenty-
four inches by thirty-six inches (24" x 36"), one eleven inch by seventeen inch
(11" x 17") and one (1) electronic copy (PDF) shall be submitted for stamp of
approval.
   G.   Final Plat Approval: If land subdivision was required for a phase or
land use area, the applicant shall submit an application for final plat
approval using the criteria and procedures required under the subdivision
ordinance. Final version of CC&Rs, development agreement, details and exhibits
shall also be submitted at this time to allow the county to determine that
there are inconsistencies with the land use ordinance.
   H.   Subsequent Phases: If the project is phased, each phase shall be
submitted according to the same requirements as the initial phase.
   I.   Minor Amendments To The Project Plan: The land use authority that
approved the project plan may consider approval of amendments to the project
plan provided that:
      1.   The applicant submits a revised set of plans detailing the proposed
change.
      2.   The change involves no more than a five percent (5%) increase in
residential density.
      3.   Involves no more than a five percent (5%) decrease in parking
allocations.
      4.   Involves no more than a five percent (5%) increase in nonresidential
floor area.
      5.   Involves no more than a five percent (5%) modification to any other
measurable project criteria.
      6.   The proposed change meets all of the requirements and provisions of
this section.
      7.   The proposed amendments do not alter any approved site development
regulations of the plan and do not materially alter other aspects of the plan,
including traffic circulation, mixture of use types, or general physical
layout.
      8.   Any proposed amendments, not conforming to these provisions shall be
considered a significant change and shall be resubmitted as a PD amendment
(zone change amendment) with a revised project plan and preliminary plat. Any
proposed amendments which do not meet the standards or other provisions of this
chapter shall first be considered by the land use authority and recommended to
the county commission for either approval, modification, or denial.
   J.   Setback And Height Standards: The setback and height minimums and
maximums listed in table 1 of this section are intended to serve as a guide to
the land use authority, the county commission, and the developer in reviewing
the standard requirements for development throughout the county. Realizing that
a specific planned development plan may vary from these standards through
innovative and creative design, the county commission, upon recommendation from
the land use authority, may adopt modifications to the above specifications as
they see fit in order to provide harmony within a PD zone as may be requested
by the developer. Items of a life/safety nature (i.e., building separation as
per fire code, and building code requirements) may not be modified. However,
other elements of the plan may be approved according to the specific
development plan, map, and text being considered as a part of the PD zone
change approval. Modifications for one particular PD zone request do not set
precedent for any other PD project. Each project shall be reviewed
independently from any other project.

*   A verifiable moderate income housing unit (MIHU) is defined as a deed
restricted unit on a form provided by the county and under terms acceptable to
the County Attorney's office ensuring that the newly constructed unit remains
owned by and affordable to low or moderate income households for a period of
not less than 100 years. Each unit shall be owner-occupied, with a primary
residential exemption as determined by the Washington County assessor's office,
with no right to short term rent the unit or any portion of it. Income
qualifications for a MIHU are based on federal tax returns showing that the
household earns less than or equal to 80% of the area median income (AMI) in
Washington County. The deed restriction shall be enforceable by the county
through legal and equitable remedies. Any lender or mortgage holder shall
execute a subordination agreement acknowledging subordination to the deed
restriction. In the event of foreclosure or trustee's sale, the county will
release the deed restriction upon reasonable request. All other sale or
transfer events are subject to the deed restriction to ensure the prospective
purchaser and unit remains affordable for the required time period. For a MIHU
in a development with a property owner's association (POA), the MIHU shall be
inside the POA for purposes of common area use, but no POA fees may be assessed
or collected against the owners or units. For all MIHU, the county in its sole
discretion may reduce minimum lot size or dwelling size standards, compared to
others in the PDR, to promote affordability if the primary goal of having the
lots and dwellings harmonize with all others is met. No garage requirements
apply to a MIHU, and shared access also may be considered by the county.

COMMERCIAL ZONES C-1, C-2, C-3, PDC
SECTION:
10-10-1: Purpose
10-10-2: Allowed Uses
10-10-3: Area, Setback And Height Requirements
10-10-4: Special Provisions
10-10-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   C-1 Convenience Commercial Zone:
      1.   The C-1 convenience commercial zone has been established for the
purpose of providing shopping facilities within the various neighborhoods of
the county, primarily for the convenience of people living in the neighborhood.
The types of goods and services which may be offered for sale have been limited
to "convenience goods" such as groceries, drugs, personal services such as
haircutting and hairdressing, distinguished by the fact that the principal
patronage of the establishments originates within the surrounding neighborhood.
Consequently, automobiles, furniture, appliances and other stores, the
principal patronage of which originates outside the surrounding neighborhood,
have been excluded from the C-1 zone. The maximum size of a C-1 zone shall not
exceed five (5) acres.
      2.   Inasmuch as this zone is usually surrounded by dwellings, it is
intended that residential amenities be maintained insofar as possible. Stores,
shops or businesses shall be retail establishments only and shall be permitted
only under the following conditions:
         a.   Such businesses shall be conducted wholly within an enclosed
building except for the parking of automobiles and service to persons in
automobiles, unless otherwise permitted.
         b.   No entertainment except music shall be permitted in any C-1 zone.
         c.   All uses shall be free from objections because of odor, dust,
smoke, noise, vibration or other similar offensive nuisances to adjacent
neighborhood areas.
   B.   C-2 Highway Commercial Zone:
      1.   The principal objective in establishing the C-2 highway commercial
zone is to provide area within the county where facilities that serve the
traveling public can be most appropriately located.
      2.   Other purposes for establishing the C-2 highway commercial zone are
to promote safety on the highways, to promote the convenience of the traveling
public, to promote beauty in the appearance of intersections and interchanges
in the county and to prohibit uses which will tend to be contrary to the use of
the land for its primary purposes or which would be unsightly to the traveling
public. In general, this zone is located close to freeway interchanges and at
the intersections of important transportation routes.
   C.   C-3 General Commercial Zone:
      1.   The objective of the C-3 general commercial zone is to provide space
within the county where nearly all types of commercial goods and services may
be provided. Since the zone permits such a wide variety of uses, the protective
features which zoning normally affords to adjacent properties are mostly
nonexistent. Owners should develop and maintain their property in recognition
thereof.
      2.   The C-3 general commercial zone should be located principally in
existing communities and not along major highways. To maximize traffic safety,
property owners should provide access in a manner that will minimize the hazard
of traffic leaving and entering roadways.
   D.   PDC Planned Development Commercial Zone:
      1.   PDC zones are located in developing areas of major traffic
thoroughfares in the county. Land located along these thoroughfares may require
PDC zoning at the discretion of the county commission if commercial use is
desired. Requirements of the PDC zone can be found in chapter 9 of this title.
(Ord. 2001-815-O, 12-17-2001, eff. 12-17-2001; amd. 2004 Code; Ord. 2019-1149-

10-10-2: ALLOWED USES:
Any use not specifically permitted, permitted with standards, or conditionally
permitted is prohibited. Only the following uses are allowed:
   A.   Uses indicated by the letter “P” below are permitted uses in this zone.
   B.   Uses indicated by the letters “PS” are permitted uses with required
standards in this zone. Uses must comply with the standards and evaluation
criteria established in this title.
   C.   Uses indicated by the letter “C” are conditional uses in this zone.

10-10A-1: PURPOSE:
The Village Commercial (VC) zone is established to provide a district in which
the primary use of the land is for small-scale commercial, retail, mixed use
residential, or service uses located at rural crossroads, along state highways,
community gateways and in convenient and strategic locations of the county to
meet community needs for both the residents and visitors to the area.
Development in the VC zone should reflect the rural, pioneer, and agricultural
heritage of “Small Town America” in the unincorporated communities throughout
Washington County. As the “Downtown” area, the VC zone should be clearly
identifiable from other zones in appearance and intensity of development. The
VC zone should feature a mix of land uses quaintly lighted streets, village
scale development with abundant pedestrian walkways, outdoor gathering areas
and shared off street parking areas. The VC zone should make provisions for
affordable and employee housing, as second story dwelling units over commercial
uses. The front of buildings and lots should be inviting, and accommodate
pedestrians, bikes, vehicles, or horses. Development should be landscaped with
appropriate drought tolerant vegetation. (Ord. 2024-1272-O, 9-17-2024)
10-10A-2: STANDARD PRINCIPLES AND COMMUNITY PLANNING:
   A.   Its objective is a development pattern which is based on traditional
town planning principles and rural open spaces, not the traditional types of
suburban and sprawl development patterns that have been occurring in past
decades. This ordinance is intended to ensure that development shall have the
following principal characteristics:
      1.   Street oriented, compact, and tight development forms.
      2.   People focused place making within principal development pods.
      3.   There may be village centers dispersed throughout the county;
provided, however, the village centers shall meet the criteria herein, as well
as all other applicable standards and guidelines in this title and the general
plan.
      4.   Villages shall be limited in physical size to control the amount of
development therein.
      5.   A focal point or center, with street edge buildings, mixed uses,
gathering places, public buildings and facilities, parks and open spaces.
Plazas should be designed as focal points for community gatherings and events,
with seating, landscaping, and shade trees and structures. Street trees,
landscaping buffers, and pocket parks should be integrated to soften the built
environment and provide gathering spaces for residents and visitors.
      6.   Commercial uses shall foster entrepreneurship and small local and
rural business.
      7.   Commercial uses shall be of a type and scale that are appropriate
for a traditionally agricultural-based gateway community environment and the
specific community in which they are located.
      8.   Village commercial shall integrate with adjacent land uses and
neighborhoods.
      9.   Village commercial shall be pedestrian friendly, but also automobile
accessible. Sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian-scale lighting shall be
provided throughout the zone to enhance walkability and safety. Public seating,
bike racks, and amenities also shall be provided.
      10.   Streets and parking lots shall be scaled for typical use not excess
use.
      11.   Parking areas are not permitted between the street and the
buildings. Parking areas shall be located to the rear of buildings. Rear
parking requirements shall meet the needs of employees, residents, customers,
and ADA parking. Shared parking is permitted with agreements approved by the
county to reduce the overall parking footprint while ensuring adequate parking
availability for all uses.
      12.   Developments shall integrate multi-use trails identified in the
County Transportation Master Plan and Outdoor Recreation Master Plan. Trails
should be designed to connect to existing and planned trail networks, providing
safe and accessible routes for pedestrians, cyclists, and recreational users.
      13.   Incorporation of existing topography, waterways, historic
structures and features is required.
   B.   Form Standards: The form rules for VC zone are set out in the following
categories (as illustrated below):
      1.   Streets: Pedestrian Frontage: Pedestrian frontages are the spaces
that occur on public or private property between the curb and the building, and
are required along all primary and secondary public streets. Good pedestrian
frontages are essential for fostering mixed-use, walkable, and pedestrian-
oriented development.
      2.   Pedestrian frontage is composed of three parts:
         a.   Furnishing/Planting Area. The furnishing/planting area is the
area between the back of curb and the clear sidewalk. This area provides for
columns, required plantings, accessible ramps, signs, fire hydrants, snow
storage, bike racks, benches, outdoor dining and seating areas, parked vehicle
overhang or door swing, etc.
         b.   Clear Sidewalk. The clear sidewalk is the primary pedestrian
travel way and shall be clear of any obstacles or protruding objects.
         c.   Building Transition Area. The remaining space between the clear
sidewalk and building facade is a semi-public/private, building transition area
that provides room for planter boxes, window shopping, outdoor cafe seating,
street furniture, public art, etc. Where private property is used for a
furnishing/planting area or a clear sidewalk, an easement may be permanently
dedicated to the public under terms acceptable to the county. Buildings must
front the street with active uses and include windows on building elevations to
enhance pedestrian engagement and contribute to a vibrant streetscape.
Architecture shall promote a cohesive and attractive streetscape, emphasizing
building materials, signage, and awnings that contribute to a welcoming
pedestrian environment. Windows are required on front building elevations that
are adjacent to right of ways to promote transparency and active street
frontages.

10-11-1: MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES:
The Manufacturing and Industrial zones are for uses that support businesses
using modern processes that protect the health, safety and welfare of County
residents, visitors and the public. The external effects of the operations and
processes determine if the use is appropriate for the Manufacturing zone or the
Industrial zone. The performance standards analysis is used to determine the
appropriate zoning designation. At the time of the requested zone change, the
initial performance standards analysis, with all measurements and evaluations,
must be provided by the business to show that it can meet or exceed the
performance standards for the zone. The county shall determine if the initial
performance standards analysis requires a review by outside experts. If so,
qualified professionals shall be selected and hired by the county, and funded
by the business desiring to locate in the county. At the time of the requested
zone change, the applicant has the burden to show that its operations and
processes meet the performance standards for the zone. Continued compliance
shall be proven by the following: (1) the installation, maintenance, operation,
and reporting by the business to the county, to demonstrate the operations and
processes remain in compliance with the performance standards, and (2) in
county’s discretion, it may select and hire qualified professionals to verify
compliance, and the expenses associated with verification of compliance shall
be paid to the county by the business desiring to continue operating in the
county. The business shall cooperate with the county throughout the
verification and compliance processes. Uses not specifically permitted, or that
do not meet or exceed the performance standards, are prohibited.
Manufacturing uses typically are consumer focused, producing products in indoor
facilities for end users rather than intermediaries for uses in other
industries. This zone acts as a border or transition between commercial zones
and industrial zones. The operations and processes shall meet or exceed the
performance standards for the zone.
Industrial uses typically involve industries that use capital and energy
intensive machinery to produce complex or large products, and can be indoors or
outdoors. Some uses include fabrication, assembly or freight handling. The
operations and processes shall meet or exceed the performance standards for the
zone.

(Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-4: APPLICABILITY, EXCEPTIONS:
Oil or gas exploration and extraction, ore refining or processing, smelting, or
calcining, are industrial uses, and not permitted in the mining and gravel
zone. Temporary concrete mixing and batching is permitted only as set forth
herein. All mining and gravel development activity shall be conducted in the
appropriate zone and with a required Mining and Gravel Permit. Grading in
preparation for any future development shall be in a mining and gravel zone if
it is conducted for the purpose of resource extraction for commercial
renumeration and in commercial quantities. Such resource extraction shall not
be conducted with a grading permit in another zone. All grading in excess of
7,500 cubic yards in the entire development area shall be conducted in a Mining
and Gravel zone, and in such quantities is conclusively presumed to be for
resource extraction for commercial renumeration. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-5: UTILITY AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
Connection shall be made to public water, electric, and sewer facilities,
unless waived by the county engineer or designee upon demonstration of an
equivalent alternative acceptable to the county. All utilities shall be located
underground, unless an alternative acceptable to the county is approved by the
county engineer or designee. The site shall have frontage on and access to a
collector or arterial street, provided the authority with jurisdiction over the
subject road may approve alternative access. County may consider an applicant’s
proposed Mining and Gravel Plan that requests a modification to the required
frontage on a collector or arterial road upon submission of a proposed easement
in lieu of required frontage (“easement in lieu”). The easement in lieu shall
be presented with the Plan, and recorded after approval of the Plan, with
written terms satisfactory to county. The easement in lieu shall have a minimum
width of 50 feet, and the construction standards for the easement area
providing access to the Mining and Gravel operation shall meet the standards
for internal roads set forth below. Acceptance of an easement in lieu is in
county’s sole discretion. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-6: STANDARDS:
   A.   Internal Roads. All onsite roads shall be maintained in a reasonably
dust-free condition. This may include, depending on conditions, watering,
oiling, or paving. County requirements for onsite roads shall be set forth in
the Mining and Gravel Permit. Onsite roads may move with phasing and shall be
shown on the site plan or updated site plan. The onsite access drives or
easement areas from the site to the public right of way shall be paved with
asphalt or concrete for a minimum distance of 100 feet. They shall be limited
to a reasonable width given the type of trucks and equipment used in the
operation. All dust, dirt, mud or other debris from vehicles shall be removed
before leaving the onsite roads or easement areas and entering the public right
of way. If the public roadway from the site is not engineered and designed to
withstand the weight of trucks hauling material from the Mining and Gravel
site, the owner or authorized operator is required to improve the connector
road from the site out to the road that is a fully engineered and designed
public road. The connector road shall be engineered and designed to withstand
the expected 20-year life of the pavement, and shall be improved at owner or
authorized operator’s sole expense. Any damage to the off-site public roads
caused by the repetitive use by the mining or gravel operation shall be
repaired at the owner or operator’s sole expense.
   B.   Limitations. All sites shall be subject to the Performance Standards
for Manufacturing found in County ORD 10-11-4. If standards in title 10,
chapter 12 are more restrictive than the Performance Standards for
Manufacturing, the more restrictive standard applies over the more general.
Noise from the mining and gravel operation, or from any temporary concrete
mixing and batching plant, is limited to the approved hours of operation only.
No mining or gravel zone or site shall be used for storage or dumping of junk
or trash as defined in titles 4 and 10. Junk, trash, or debris is additionally
defined as dead or dying vegetation, combustible material, landscape debris, or
construction debris. Property in the mining and gravel zone shall not be used
as a landfill or dump site.
   C.   Setback to Dwellings: All resource extraction, overburden, and storage
areas shall have a minimum 100 foot setback from any dwelling or accessory
dwelling in the Mining and Gravel zone or on any adjacent parcel zoned OST that
has a current, existing, and valid CUP for an allowed use in the M-G zone, and
a minimum 200 foot setback from any dwelling or accessory dwelling on any
adjacent lot or parcel in any other zone. All crushers or concrete mixing and
batching plant operations, shall have a minimum radius setback of 400 feet from
the operation to any dwelling or accessory dwelling on the property or on an
adjacent lot or parcel.
   D.   Parking: One space for each employee on the shift with the highest
number of employees, and one space for each vehicle used in association with
the resource extraction. The designated parking spaces shall be separated from
the active resource extraction areas and shown on the site plan. Designated
parking spaces may move with phasing, but must remain separated from the active
resource extraction areas.
   E.   Responsibility: The owner and authorized operator are jointly
responsible for compliance with all laws and county requirements. All required
applications, documents, plans, and performance assurances shall be submitted
and approved by the county prior to commencement of construction or operation.
Any change in the owner or authorized operator requires the express, written
approval of the county, including assumption of the duties and responsibilities
to perform operations in compliance with county approvals, and including new
performance assurances.
   F.   Laws. All operations, emissions, water use, or discharges shall conform
to Utah Department of Environmental Quality standards, as well as all local,
state, and federal laws and regulations. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)

   A.   Prior to any resource extraction activity, the owner or authorized
operator shall submit a Mining and Gravel Plan, and obtain Planning Commission
approval of it at a public meeting. All details in the Mining and Gravel Plan
are subject to county approval. The Mining and Gravel Plan shall contain the
following, minimum information:
      1.   A detailed description of the method of operation of extraction,
including any necessary accessory uses such as, but not limited to, crushers,
or temporary concrete mixing and batching plants. A detailed description of the
type of resource being extracted. The type of resource extraction is limited to
the applicant's description.
      2.   Topography of the area prior to resource extraction with contour
lines in sufficient detail to portray the direction and rate of slope of the
land covered in the application. Detailed information of the proposed areas for
resource extraction, and proposed changes to the topography due to resource
extraction. Photographs of the area prior to resource extraction. The surface
of each phase shall remain natural and undisturbed until extraction begins for
that phase. Disturb the surface of the property only in accordance with the
phase plan. If the property contains slopes over twenty-percent (20%), a county
Hillside Development Permit is required with more detailed topography and
cross-sectional information along with the Mining and Gravel Permit.
      3.   Resource extraction details showing areas of extraction, depth of
proposed extraction, tonnage, stockpiles, overburden, and other pertinent
factors. Vertical or highwall cuts are limited to sixty feet (60'). After
cutting, the land shall be sloped at three to one (3:1) or less. Slope
stability is required at all stages of resource extraction and may require land
to be sloped at less than three to one (3:1) as needed. All resource extraction
shall be phased based on depth of the proposed extraction and/or tonnage, in
the discretion of the county. The Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan herein
shall provide for site restoration on a continuous basis, and by phase, and
upon cessation of operations.
      4.   Proposed work shift details including hours of operation, and
limited by the requirements in County Ord. 10-12-2(D). These limits also apply
to servicing the resource extraction equipment.

plan showing lot or parcel lines, setbacks, structures, processing equipment,
employee parking, internal roadways, and access to public rights-of-way. All
resource extraction activities, stockpiles, and overburden, shall be shown on
the site plan, and shall be out of the required setbacks.
      6.   County may require fencing, screening, berming, or buffering for
safety, site control, or to mitigate the visibility and negative impact of the
resource extraction activities. County shall determine what fencing, screening,
or buffering shall remain during and after rehabilitation is complete.
      7.   A drainage report and plan prepared by a qualified engineer licensed
in Utah. Consider existing and natural drainage, drainage during resource
extraction, and drainage during and after rehabilitation. Resource extraction
shall not adversely impair existing and natural drainage. Pooling, stagnating,
or accumulating drainage is not permitted. Resource extraction activities shall
not result in pooling, ground water contamination, or flooding onsite or off-
site. Any pooling shall fully drain in twenty-four (24) hours or less.
      8.   A general blasting plan is required with the Mining and Gravel Plan.
It should detail the type, frequency, and time of day for proposed blasting.
County in its sole discretion also may require preblast surveys and seismic
monitoring as part of the plan. No blasting shall occur before seven o’clock
(7:00) a.m. or after five o’clock (5:00) p.m. All blasting shall be in
conformity with the plan. A county blasting permit also is required for
blasting in a Mining and Gravel zone. The blasting permit request shall
summarize all planned blasting in any seven (7)-day period. All subsequent
planned blasting after the seven (7)-day period shall require a new blasting
permit. Refer to Washington County Design Standards, section 2.9 Explosives,
and section 2.9.1 General Blasting Criteria.

Engineer or designee. The county may place reasonable restrictions on rights-
of-way use, including, but not limited to, designating alternative haul routes,
limiting hours of use, or any other reasonable regulation to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the public. All vehicles entering the public
right-of-way shall have weight distribution properties that prevent damage to
the public right-of-way. If damage occurs, the owner and authorized operator
are responsible for the cost of repairs. If the extracted resource is being
hauled to another site in Washington County, Utah, a log shall be kept showing
the date, time of day, haul route, and receiving site location. The receiving
site shall have all approvals and permits needed for receiving the extracted
resource.
      12.   Detail conformance with state resource extraction standards,
regulations and requirements, including, but not limited to Utah Administrative
Code, title 647, as amended.
      13.   A development schedule for the Mining and Gravel Plan stating the

   A.   Along with the Mining and Gravel Plan, the owner or authorized operator
shall submit a Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan, and obtain Planning
Commission approval at a public meeting. All details in the Rehabilitation and
Reclamation Plan are subject to county approval. The Rehabilitation and
Reclamation Plan shall contain the following, minimum information:
      1.   A detailed description showing proposed final rehabilitation and
reclamation, finished contours, backfill, grading, slope, and drainage. A
description of the proposed topography of the area after resource extraction,
and the rehabilitation and reclamation, with contour lines in sufficient detail
to portray the direction and rate of slope of the land being rehabilitated or
reclaimed. Include rehabilitation and reclamation of all resource extraction
areas, as well as all stockpile and overburden areas. All slopes shall be
stabilized and revegetated in a manner approved by the county and compatible
with the original, natural environment, to county’s satisfaction. Detail all
proposed erosion control mitigations.
      2.   Detail conformance with state rehabilitation and reclamation
standards, regulations and requirements, including, but not limited to Utah
Administrative Code sections 647-3-107 through 109, and 647-4-111, as amended.

during and after the resource extraction activity. Rehabilitation and
reclamation activity is required during all phases of resource extraction, and
thereafter until the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan is complete.
Rehabilitation and reclamation activity shall be continuous throughout
execution of the Plan, and failure to continuously comply may result in the
denial, revocation, or non-renewal of the Mining and Gravel Permit, or the
county business license. Failure to continuously comply with the Rehabilitation
and Reclamation Plan is automatic grounds for denial or non-renewal of any
county permit or business license.
      4.   Placement and amount of topsoil, planting, and revegetation. The
type, character, and density of proposed revegetation. A protection plan for
vegetation establishment, maintenance, and replacement.

modified, or denied by the Community Development and Public Works departments
or designees. Substantial changes to the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan
shall be considered, approved, modified, or denied by the Planning Commission
at a public meeting. The Community Development director or designee determines,
in the county’s sole discretion, if the proposed changes to the Rehabilitation
and Reclamation Plan are minor or substantial.
   C.   Rehabilitation and reclamation shall be completed within six months of
completion of a phase. Final rehabilitation and reclamation shall be completed
within six months of the cessation of operations under the Mining and Gravel
Plan. In some instances, post-closure monitoring may be required by the county.
If it is required, it shall continue after the six month rehabilitation and
reclamation deadline to county’s satisfaction. Upon timely request, the
Community Development director may grant a six month extension for any phase of
the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan. Any additional extensions shall be
considered by the Planning Commission at a public meeting. Cumulative
extensions from the Community Development and the Planning Commission regarding
the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan shall not exceed three years total
related to the property and its phases.
   D.   A Memorandum of Terms of the Reclamation and Rehabilitation Plan, with
provisions acceptable to the county, shall be executed and acknowledged by the
owner, the authorized operator, and the county, and recorded in the Washington
County Recorder’s office respecting the property, stating that the duty to
perform under the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan runs with the land and
binds all subsequent owners and operators of the property. (Ord. 2024-1276-O,
11-19-2024)
10-12-9: PERFORMANCE ASSURANCE, BOND:
The owner or authorized operator shall be financially capable of constructing,
operating, and properly closing the site, including any rehabilitation,
reclamation, and post-closure monitoring. All mining and gravel operations are
required to provide performance assurance prior to issuance of a Mining and
Gravel Permit to assure that the Mining and Gravel Plan, and the Rehabilitation
and Reclamation Plan, are followed and completed. The performance assurance
shall be a cash bond or cash escrow under terms acceptable to the county. The
amount of the performance assurance shall be 100% of the total estimated cost
of rehabilitation, reclamation, post-closure monitoring, and reasonable costs
of enforcement. Applicant shall provide an itemized estimate of the costs,
prepared by a licensed engineer, which shall be reviewed, accepted, modified,
or rejected by the county. In its sole discretion, the county may rely on
performance assurance provided to the state for the resource extraction and
reclamation activity. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-10: APPROVAL OF PLANS, ISSUANCE OF MINING AND GRAVEL PERMIT:
Once the Mining and Gravel Plan, the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan, and
the performance assurance have been approved and accepted by the county, the
applicant can obtain a Mining and Gravel Permit and a business license.
Resource extraction shall not commence until all approvals, permits and
licenses are obtained, including a Hillside Development Permit if needed. The
Mining and Gravel Permit and business license are valid for one year at a time.
A yearly county inspection shall be conducted by the Community Development
department, and if the operator is in compliance with the Plan, it can obtain a
renewal without further action. If the owner or authorized operator are not in
compliance with the Plan, they have 30 days to correct non-compliant items
identified by the county at the yearly inspection and ask for a reinspection.
If still not in compliance, the Plan and business license are automatically
revoked and not renewed. The owner or authorized operator will be sent a
Revocation Letter, notifying of the automatic revocation or nonrenewal by mail,
deemed effective three business days after mailing. If the operations continue
three business days after mailing of the Revocation Letter, the owner and
authorized operator will be fined $500 a day until operations cease. If the
owner or operator fail to cease operations after an additional ten business
days, the fine will increase to $1,000 a day. The owner or authorized operator
then would have to resubmit a Mining and Gravel Plan, obtain county approvals
of the plan, and obtain a new Mining and Gravel Permit and business license. It
is the owner or authorized operator’s duty to request a yearly inspection a
minimum of 30 days before permit expiration, and obtain all inspections
necessary for yearly renewals. The Planning Commission may consider, and
approve, modify, or deny the plans presented by the owner or authorized
operator. Upon approval of plans by the county, a copy shall be placed on file
in the community development department. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-11: YEARLY INSPECTIONS AND COMPLIANCE:
The owner or authorized operator shall request and obtain a yearly site
inspection from the Community Development Department or its designee and
demonstrate compliance with the approved plans. This inspection is mandatory
prior to yearly renewal of the Mining and Gravel Permit, or the business
license. Additional inspections may be conducted by the county to ensure that
the site complies with the conditions approved in the plans. Failure to comply
with the inspection requirements, or failure to demonstrate compliance with the
approved plans, may also result in other penalties provided in county
ordinances. Applicant has a continuous duty to demonstrate that it intends to
complete the resource extraction according to the Mining and Gravel Plan, and
the Rehabilitation and Reclamation Plan, and in the time allotted in the
approvals. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)
10-12-12: EXPIRATION:
If the owner or authorized operator has not performed substantial onsite
operations, including resource extraction for commercial renumeration and in
commercial quantities, for a period of more than one year, all approved plans
are automatically deemed expired. No resource extraction can resume without a
new application and approvals under title 10, including compliance with new
standards and regulations for resource extraction. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-
2024)
10-12-13: EFFECT OF THE ZONE, EXISTING CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS:
All mining and gravel operations approved as a conditional use permit or
otherwise, prior to adoption of the title 10, chapter 12, Mining and Gravel
zone, may continue to operate in the zone in which they were approved, and
strictly under the conditions of the approved conditional use permit. Any
substantial change to an existing conditional use permit, that was approved
prior to adoption of the Mining and Gravel zone, requires compliance with the
provisions herein, chapter 12, sections 7 through 10. The Community Development
director or designee determines, in the county’s sole discretion, if the
proposed changes to the conditional use permit are minor or substantial. If a
pre-existing conditional use permit has expired or terminated, the applicant
shall seek and obtain a zone change to Mining and Gravel, and shall seek and
obtain a Mining and Gravel Permit, before recommencing or continuing resource
extraction. (Ord. 2024-1276-O, 11-19-2024)

10-13-18: ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (ADU):
   A.   Purpose and Intent: The purpose of this chapter is to provide
regulations for accessory dwelling units that are incidental and accessory to a
single family dwelling, where permitted in the zone. Accessory dwelling units
are intended to assist in providing housing types that meet the needs of
populations of various income levels, ages, and stages of life. In accordance
with the goals of the general plan, and state law, providing tools and methods
for the creation of moderate income housing is necessary in the areas of
unincorporated Washington County. Accessory dwelling units created in
accordance with this section will assist in providing for this need.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   Number of accessory dwelling units per parcel. An accessory dwelling
unit shall only be permitted on a parcel with a single family dwelling. Only
one accessory dwelling unit is permitted on a lot or parcel that is zoned less
than five (5) acres. On a lot or parcel that is zoned five (5) acres or more,
one additional accessory dwelling unit may be approved for each additional five
(5) acres above the base five (5) acres, in the sole discretion of the county.
No more than four (4) accessory dwellings shall be allowed on a lot or parcel,
except when zoned and approved in a planned development that complies will all
applicable county ordinances. Only one accessory dwelling unit on the property
may be rented.
      2.   Amenities. An accessory dwelling unit shall contain sufficient
amenities to be defined as a dwelling. An accessory dwelling unit shall not
have more than one kitchen.
      3.   Parking. Two parking spaces shall be provided on site for each
accessory dwelling unit, and it shall be on a hard-surface area. Only one
parking space is required for an internal ADU, and it shall be on a hard-
surface area.
      4.   Occupancy. Either the accessory dwelling unit or the single-family
dwelling shall be owner-occupied, and be the primary residence of the owner-
occupant with the primary residential exemption as determined by the Washington
County assessor's office, in order to utilize the other dwelling as a long term
rental dwelling. The non-owner-occupied unit is limited to no more than one
family. For the purposes of this subsection "owner-occupied dwelling unit"
means a unit that is occupied by the owner for a minimum of one hundred eighty-
three (183) consecutive calendar days during the calendar year, except
temporary leave for religious, military, or other legitimate purposes qualifies
as owner occupancy if not exceeding two years. While away, the owner shall not
offer the owner-occupied dwelling unit for rent separately from the accessory
dwelling unit.
      5.   Short term rentals not permitted. Neither the single family dwelling
unit, nor the accessory dwelling unit, shall be used or licensed as a short
term rental unless specifically permitted in accordance with section
10-13-23.
      6.   Relevant authority approvals. The accessory dwelling unit shall
comply with regulations, ordinances and building codes for a single family
dwelling. Approval is required from all utility and service providers and the
Building Official.
   C.   Standards And Requirements:
      1.   Standards same as single family dwellings. If new construction for
an accessory dwelling unit is proposed or will occur, the standards for single
family dwellings shall apply. An accessory dwelling unit shall comply with the
same permit standards, lot development standards, and setbacks as required in
the respective zone. No travel trailer, boat, recreational vehicle, or similar
item shall be used as an accessory dwelling unit.
      2.   Size and height. The size and height regulations for an accessory
dwelling unit are as follows:
         a.   Fifteen hundred (1,500) sq. ft. maximum: For all lots or parcels
in zones designated as one-half (1/2) acre minimum lot size or less, the ADU
shall not exceed fifteen hundred (1,500) sq. ft. or be less than one hundred
and fifty (150) sq. ft. The height shall not exceed twenty five (25) ft.
         b.   Twenty-five hundred (2,500) sq. ft. maximum: For all lots or
parcels in zones designated as forty thousand (40,000) sq. ft. minimum lot size
up to two and one-half (2.5) acre minimum lot size, the ADU shall not exceed
twenty five hundred (2,500) sq. ft. or be less than one hundred and fifty (150)
sq. ft. The height shall not exceed thirty five (35) ft.
         c.   Thirty-five hundred (3,500) sq. ft. maximum: For all lots or
parcels in zones designated as more than two and one-half (2.5) acre minimum
lot size, the ADU shall not exceed thirty five hundred (3,500) sq. ft. or be
less than one hundred and fifty (150) sq. ft. The height shall not exceed

         d.   For an internal accessory dwelling unit, the ADU shall not exceed
the size permitted in state law, or the height in section
10-13-18 .C.2.a, b and c. For an internal accessory dwelling unit located
entirely within the basement of a single-family dwelling, it may include the
entire basement area regardless of square footage.
   D.   Application Procedure: Approval of an accessory dwelling unit requires
a land use permit. The application and review procedure for a land use permit
is as follows:
      1.   Application submittal requirements.
         a.   A completed application form signed by the property owner or
assigned agent.
         b.   An application fee. The payment of a partial application fee, or
the submittal of plans for a pre-submittal review, does not constitute a
complete application.
         c.   A site plan drawn accurately to scale that shows property lines
and dimensions, setbacks, the location of existing buildings and building
entrances, any proposed building and its dimensions from buildings and property
lines, and the location of parking stalls.
         d.   Detailed floor plans, including elevations, drawn to scale with
labels on rooms indicating proposed uses.
         e.   Detailed utility plans, drawn to scale showing the location of
private and public utility infrastructure on the lot or parcel, and the
connections to any public utilities.
      2.   Review procedure.
         a.   Upon submittal of a complete accessory dwelling unit application,
Community Development staff will review the application to verify compliance
with this chapter and any other relevant component of County ordinances.
         b.   Community Development staff will route the application to the
local fire authority, local health department, the County Building Division,
Public Works and any other relevant review department or agency for
verification of compliance, determination of need for land use permit
application modifications, and for the submittal of other applications or
reviews necessary to obtain their approvals of an accessory dwelling unit.
         c.   If the land use permit application complies with relevant land
use laws, and receives all required department and agency approvals, a land use
permit shall be issued. If the application requires submittal of other
applications or reviews necessary to attain the approvals of other required
departments or agencies, but otherwise complies with relevant land use laws,
the application shall be given conditional approval by Community Development,
conditioned on approval of other reviewers. The accessory dwelling unit shall
maintain compliance with the approved permit.
         d.   If the application does not comply, Community Development staff
shall notify the applicant in writing, using the notification method typical
for similar correspondence. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to
revise the application to bring it into compliance. If the application cannot
be brought into compliance, the application shall be denied. A denial by the
Community Development staff is an administrative decision. Alternatively, the
applicant may withdraw the application, forfeiting the fee.
         e.   Upon receipt of an approved land use permit, the applicant shall
submit for a building permit, prior to construction or use of the space as an
accessory dwelling unit.
         f.   If the accessory dwelling unit is rented, a business license is
required. License renewal requires owner's proof of continued compliance with
the requirements in this section.
      3.   Use as a long term rental dwelling. The primary dwelling or the ADU
may be long term rented on the parcel or lot if the owner provides proof that
the property has the primary residential exemption as determined by the
Washington County assessor's office, and that the primary residence or the ADU
is owner-occupied. A deed restriction, recorded against the property on a form
acceptable to the county, acknowledging that the lot or parcel will remain
owner-occupied, is required in order for one accessory dwelling unit on the
property to be long term rented.
   E.   Enforcement: Violations of this chapter are subject to enforcement and
penalties as outlined in Washington County zoning regulations. Noncompliance
with the standards of this section shall be just cause for the denial of a
business license application or renewal, or revocation of an existing business
license, if the original conditions are not maintained that allowed the
accessory dwelling unit. (Ord. 2021-1196-O, 10-5-2021; amd. Ord. 2025-1292-O,

is subject to the exceptions listed in subsection
11-5-3C of this Code. Said installation may be required as a condition of
obtaining a building permit, and shall be completed as a part of the building
permit prior to occupancy. (Ord. 2016-1058-O, 4-5-2016)
10-13-20: DUMPING OR DISPOSAL:

   B.   The dumping of dirt, sand, rock or other material excavated from the
earth shall be permitted in any district; provided, that the surface of such
dumped material is graded, leaving the ground surface in a condition suitable
for other use permitted in the district; and provided further, that such fill
does not increase the susceptibility of the ground to erosion, landslide,
flooding or other dangerous condition. Concrete may be dumped as fill in
excavations where it will be buried and not remain on the land surface.
   C.   No person, firm or corporation shall strip, excavate or otherwise
remove topsoil for sale or for use other than on the premises from which the
same shall be taken, except in connection with the construction or alteration
of a building on those premises or where an excavation permit has been issued
by the county. (Ord. 2001-815-O, 12-17-2001, eff. 12-17-2001)

10-13-23: SHORT TERM RENTAL (STR):
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   Create a process for the application and licensing of a residential
dwelling for transient use as a short term rental. Address the granting,
enforcement, and revocation of a Short Term Rental License.
      2.   Establish that the short term rental of a dwelling is a transient
use only permitted by a valid county license. It is not a dwelling type, zone
or entitlement. Also establish that a license only will be granted where the
utility infrastructure, size limitations, setbacks, parking requirements, and
all other licensing requirements are strictly complied with, and all county,
state and federal laws.
      3.   Establish regulations to safeguard the public health, safety and
welfare by providing for the licensing and maintenance of a short term rental
in the unincorporated areas of Washington County.
      4.   Ensure that transient use of a dwelling for short term rental is
operated in a manner that is safe for transient users, compatible with the
community, and complies with the code and policies.
      5.   Ensure that a Short Term Rental License is only granted when it is
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and protects the overall character
of the community, mitigating the effects of a short term rental on
neighborhoods from increased noise, traffic, parking, trash, waste, and water
use.
   B.   Applicability: This section applies to the transient use of a dwelling
for short term rental in the unincorporated areas of Washington County as
defined herein, where a valid license is maintained. This section applies to
all existing nonconforming short term rentals except the owner occupancy
requirement in C.2., and the size limitation in E.3. It does not apply to long
term rentals. It does not apply to hotels, condotels, motels, timeshares,
fractional ownership units, or other similar facilities with central check-in
locations.
   C.   General Provisions:
      1.   Only one STR. Only one dwelling on a lot or parcel may obtain a
license as a short term rental, and only where the single family dwelling and
accessory dwelling legally exist. The STR shall not have lockouts or other
features that increase the number of units being short term rented in any
manner. The entire dwelling or entire ADU may constitute a STR, but only for
the approved square footage in the license and at the situs for the STR as set
forth in the license. No other ADU or portion of an ADU, and no other dwelling
or portion of a dwelling, may be advertised or rented as a STR. Room shares,
home shares, hostel-rooms, or amenity rentals (shared kitchen, bathroom,
amenities or other common facilities) are prohibited. All provisions in this
code shall be met, including the size limitations and setbacks for the dwelling
as applicable in the zone.
      2.   Owner-occupancy required. A Short Term Rental License shall not be
issued for a dwelling on a lot or parcel unless the single family dwelling, or
the accessory dwelling, is owner-occupied. For the purposes of this section, an
“owner-occupant” shall have a primary residential exemption on the lot or
parcel as determined by the Washington County Assessor’s office, and shall be a
permanent, full time resident at the same address. A Short Term Rental License
automatically expires if the primary residential exemption is denied, lost,
removed or revoked for any reason.
      3.   Short Term Rental License Density Limit. Each subdivision, or phase
of a subdivision, is limited to the number of STR licenses that do not exceed
10% based on the number of lots in the subdivision or phase thereof. No
additional STR licenses shall be granted for a fractional number of lots (i.e.
a subdivision or phase with 15 lots may only obtain up to one STR license). STR
licenses shall be disbursed throughout the subdivision based on its phases, and
limited in number based on the number of lots in each phase and the total
number of lots in the subdivision (i.e. a subdivision phase with 28 lots may
obtain up to two STR licenses; a subdivision with a total of 98 lots may obtain
up to nine STR licenses if appropriately disbursed by phase). The license
density limit does not apply to subdivisions with nine lots or less. If an
approved overlay zone has more restrictive STR density limit provisions, the
more restrictive controls over the less restrictive. The Community Development
Department shall develop and implement policies regarding a waiting list for
Short Term Rental Licenses by subdivision.
      4.   Access and Occupancy Limit. All short term rentals shall have an
access and occupancy limit of four people per bedroom based on the number of
bedrooms listed on the septic permit or on the approved plans, whichever number
is less (the “approved bedrooms”). Only legal bedrooms may be advertised,
rented or used as sleeping quarters. Sleeping accommodations shall not be
provided, advertised, rented or used in rooms other than approved bedrooms. No
STR may be advertised, rented or used by more people than the maximum access
and occupancy limit. Access to the property shall be limited to confirmed
guests. It is the owner or property manager’s duty to monitor its STR to
prevent violation of the access and occupancy limits with monitors, cameras, or
guest screening apps. Data from STR monitors, cameras, or guest screening apps
shall be stored by the owner or property manager for 90 days, and shall be
provided to the County no later than five business days after a request, in an
easily accessible format, or it is a violation. Other health and safety
occupancy limits may apply to a specific property or dwelling based on the
building code, fire code, septic permit, or other restrictions. The occupancy
limit is effective 60 days after enactment of these regulations.
      5.   Advertising. All advertising in the control of owner, owner
occupant, or local property manager for short term rental of a dwelling shall
include the Washington County Short Term Rental License number and relevant
limitations (i.e. dwelling size, parking, occupancy limit, and state “no
events, parties or excessive noise are allowed”).
      6.   Taxes collected and remitted. All taxes, including transient room
tax, shall be collected at the time of rental and remitted to Washington County
via the State of Utah. Non-compliance may result in suspension, revocation,
non-renewal, or denial of a Short Term Rental License, in the discretion of the
county.
   D.   Application Required: At least 30 days prior to advertising a dwelling
for short term rental, the owner shall file a written application with the
Community Development Department on its approved form seeking a Short Term
Rental License. The application shall not be deemed complete until all required
information is submitted.

and interior of the dwelling for transient use as a short term rental, and the
pictures of the exterior of the dwelling that is the subject of the licensing

         a.   Processing. A complete application shall be processed by the
Community Development Department in accordance with applicable criteria set
forth in county, state and federal laws.
         b.   Issuance or Denial Decision. The Community Development Department
shall determine if the application is complete and all the criteria are met,
and make a decision based on substantial evidence whether to issue or deny a
Short Term Rental License. The licensing decision of the Community Development
Department is a final administrative decision.
         c.   Renewal or Revocation Decision. The Community Development
Department shall determine if all the criteria for renewal are met, and make a
decision based on substantial evidence whether to renew or revoke a Short Term
Rental License. The decision of the Community Development Department is a final
administrative decision.
         d.   License Expiration. If the owner, owner occupant, or local
property manager does not seek renewal timely, or if the license is not in the
name of the current property owner within the requisite 30 days, or if the
primary residential exemption is denied, lost, removed or revoked for any
reason, the Short Term Rental License is deemed expired. Expiration of a
license is based on action or inaction of the owner, owner occupant, or local

the yearly fire safety inspection from the applicable fire special service
district if required. All license information shall be updated by the owner at
least annually at the time of renewal. Renewal determinations will be based on
substantial evidence by the county and renewal may be approved, approved with
conditions, or denied based on any of the following factors: failure to comply
with any term, condition or requirement in this section; unpaid fees, fines or
penalties; unremitted taxes; incomplete or failed inspections; substantiated
complaints received by the county including the Community Development
Department, the Sheriff’s office, or the County Attorney’s office constituting
three violations under the enforcement provisions of this section; or any
zoning or building code violation, or any septic failure, if not corrected and
cleared within 60 days of the initial code violation or septic failure notice.
      4.   Appeal process only for final administrative decisions:

   F.   All STR owner, owner-occupants, or local property managers are required
to share the “Good Neighbor Policy” brochure adopted by the Community
Development Department with all prospective renters or guests, and have it
clearly displayed in the STR. The Good Neighbor Policy includes a list of
general rules of conduct, best practices and standard of respect for the owner
or owner-occupant, the local property manager, and their renters and guests.
Failure to follow all policies, regulations, or laws is a violation under the
enforcement provisions below.
   G.   Tents, recreational vehicles (RV’s), campers or similar units that were
not designed for permanent residential use are prohibited as STRs. Overnight
occupancy of recreational vehicles, camp trailers or tents at the STR property
is prohibited. Attaching any such unit to any power, water, or sewer source, or
opening slide-outs, pop-outs, bump-outs, or tip-outs on any such unit, also is
prohibited.
   H.   A Short Term Rental License is valid only for the person, entity,
dwelling, and square footage identified in the license.

   K.   Parking. All parking for short term rental use shall be graveled or
paved and entirely on the lot or parcel. There shall be a minimum of one
required parking stall per approved bedroom. No parking is permitted on the

permitted to park vehicles or trailers on the adjacent public or private
streets.
   L.   Trespass: Trespass by renters, guests or their invitees on private
property in the vicinity of a STR is prohibited. It may result in criminal

public airports or runways is strictly prohibited.
   M.   Events; Parties; Noise: A residential dwelling with a Short Term Rental
License, and its lot or parcel, shall not be used by the STR renters, guests or
invitees for events, parties, or excessive noise. It is the intent of this
section to strictly limit the use to short term lodging, and not to host
events, parties, or have excessive noise; such use would change the nature of
the residential setting and is not permitted. For STR use, prohibited events or
parties also are defined as any gathering where the attendance numbers exceed
40 people, or exceed the occupancy limit for the STR as set forth above,
whichever number is less. Prohibited events or parties also are defined as any
disruptive gathering, or any “open invitation” gathering. The following indicia
of an event or party is prohibited: food trucks, catering trucks, mobile game
trucks, caterers, on-site party or event planners or coordinators, live music,
disc jockey, portable PA systems, outdoor movie screen, fireworks, temporary
lighting, rental or delivery of event or party supplies or equipment (i.e.
chairs, tables, tents, laser tag, inflatables, climbing walls). It is the owner
or property manager’s duty to monitor its STR with noise, motion, camera, or
guest screening apps (i.e. Party Squasher; Noise Aware) to prevent events,
parties, or excessive noise. Data from STR monitors, cameras or apps shall be
stored by the owner or property manager for 90 days, and shall be provided to
the County no later than five business days after a request, in an easily
accessible format, or it is a violation. In addition to events, parties, or
excessive noise herein, Special Events, as defined in County Ord. 3-3-1, et.
seq., also are prohibited at a STR. For STR use, excessive noise is defined as
follows:
      1.   Quiet Time. Quiet time is defined as after 10:00 p.m. to before 7:00
a.m. Any noise emanating beyond the property line during quiet time for a
continuous period of 10 minutes or more is prohibited if the average decibel
level at or beyond the property line is 55 dB or more.
      2.   Daytime. Daytime is defined as 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Any noise
emanating beyond the property line during daytime for a continuous period of 10
minutes or more is prohibited if the average decibel level at or beyond the
property line is 75 dB or more. The emitted noise from landscape maintenance
equipment or maintenance personnel is an exception during daytime if reasonable
and necessary to maintain the grounds or the property.
   N.   Lighting: All exterior lighting shall be permanently installed. As it
is replaced in the normal course of maintenance or repair, exterior lighting
shall be fully shielded, downward directed, and not exceed one foot candle at
or beyond the property line at any time to prevent prohibited light trespass.
Flickering, flashing, or scrolling lights are prohibited. Pole lights shall not
exceed 12 feet in height. Exterior pole, court, pool, or flood lights shall be
on timers and automatically shut off during quiet time. Motion sensor security
lighting is permitted if it is downward directed to prevent light trespass, and
set to turn off no more than 10 minutes after the last detection of motion. It
is the owner or property manager’s duty to monitor its STR for light trespass
and store the data for 90 days, and provide it to the County no later than five
business days after a request, in an easily accessible format, or it is a
violation.
   O.   Sound Systems; Speakers: All sound systems and exterior speakers shall
be permanently installed and have volume limiters. No other sound systems or
exterior speakers are permitted. The owner, owner occupant, or local property
manager shall set the volume of the sound system and exterior speakers to
automatically shut off during quiet time, and to stay at or below permitted
decibel levels during daytime. It is the owner or property manager’s duty to
monitor its STR for sound system use and volume and store the data for 90 days,
and provide it to the County no later than five business days after a request,
in an easily accessible format, or it is a violation.
   P.   Limitation of Liability: Washington County assumes no responsibility
for the operation of the STR, and the owner or owner-occupant covenants and
agrees to hold the county harmless for any injury or damage which may occur, of
whatever type or nature, as the result of the operation of the STR. Owner or
owner-occupant shall maintain appropriate liability insurance for the STR.
Owner or owner-occupant further warrants and agrees to compensate the county
for any expense incurred in the defense of any lawsuit or other type of action
which may be brought against the county as a result of the owner’s or owner-
occupant’s operation of this use. Nothing contained in this section allows a
STR if otherwise prohibited by any applicable covenants. Covenants are
privately enforced according to their terms.
   Q.   Illegal; Unlicensed STRs, Taxes:
      1.   Offering, advertising, operating, or renting a dwelling or ADU, or
portion thereof, as a STR without a valid Washington County Short Term Rental
License is strictly prohibited and a violation.
      2.   Failure to collect and remit taxes, including transient room tax, at
the time of a rental of a licensed, illegal or unlicensed STR unit is strictly
prohibited and a violation.
      3.   Pursuant to Utah Code Ann. § 17-27a-803(3) the civil penalty for
each such violation is $4,000 after notice and a 14-day reasonable opportunity
to cure the violation. Substantial evidence of the violation, and failure to
pay the fine within 20 days of the written violation notice, also will result
in a Notice of Fine being filed with the county recorder against the property
evidencing the violation and fine, and mailed to the record owner of the
property. When the fine has been paid or resolved, the county will file a
Notice of Satisfaction of Fine. Any property with a recorded Notice of Fine is
not eligible to obtain a Washington County Short Term Rental License. Any
violation under this subsection also may be prosecuted as a class B
misdemeanor. Each additional violation is a separate class B misdemeanor.
   R.   Enforcement:
      1.   General enforcement.
         a.   This section shall be enforced by the Community Development
Department, the Washington County Sheriff’s office, and the County Attorney’s
office as deemed appropriate by the county.
         b.   Issuance, maintenance or retention of a Short Term Rental License
is strictly contingent on compliance with all requirements in this section, and
county, state and federal law.
         c.   All renter or guest complaints shall first be directed to the
owner, owner-occupant or local property manager. The owner, owner-occupant or
local property manager shall respond to the renter or guest complaint and
attempt to resolve it within two hours. The owner, owner occupant, or local
property manager must be able to be physically present at the STR to respond to
emergencies and complaints within two hours of being contacted. Failure of the
owner, owner-occupant or local property manager to respond within two hours of
notification by a renter or guest shall be considered a violation of this
section.
         d.   All county complaints shall first be directed to the owner,
owner-occupant or local property manager. The owner, owner-occupant or local
property manager shall respond to the county complaint and attempt to resolve
it within one hour. The owner, owner occupant, or local property manager must
be able to be physically present at the STR to respond to emergencies and
complaints within two hours of being contacted by the county, or it is a
violation. Failure of the owner, owner-occupant or local property manager to
respond to the county within one hour of being contacted by phone, or within 48
hours if contacted by email, also shall be considered a violation of this
section.
         e.   All civil penalties or criminal citations related to violations
enumerated herein can be enforced against the owner, owner-occupant, or local
property manager.
         f.   All criminal citations issued to renters or guests shall not be
used as violations against the owner, owner-occupant, or local property
manager. However, in some cases, a criminal citation issued to a renter or
guest may be substantial evidence of a violation by the owner, owner occupant,
or local property manager (i.e. a guest cited for disorderly conduct may be
evidence of an unpermitted event or party, or excessive noise).
      2.   Hybrid violations. Certain violations are defined as hybrid
violations, and will not result in a violation notice unless the owner, owner
occupant, or local property manager fails to pay the hybrid violation fine in a
timely manner. The fine for each hybrid violation is set forth below.
Substantial evidence of the violation, and failure to pay the hybrid violation
fine within 20 days of the written hybrid violation notice, is an enforceable
violation under (R)(3). In addition to being a (R)(3) violation, failure to pay
the hybrid violation fine also will result in a Notice of Fine being filed with
the county recorder against the property evidencing the hybrid violation fine,
and mailed to the record owner of the property. When the fine has been paid,
the county will file a Notice of Satisfaction of Fine, but if the fine was not
paid timely the (R)(3) violation remains. If any two hybrid violations occur
within any 12-month period, the third hybrid violation is an enforceable
violation under (R)(3). Hybrid violations are:
         a.   Trash receptacles placed for street pick-up too early, or not
removed from the curb or street by noon the day after scheduled pickup by the
trash service provider. The fine is $500 for each such hybrid violation;
         b.   Vehicles of renters, occupants, or their invitees parked on the
public or private street adjacent to the STR property for more than two hours.
Cleaning, landscape maintenance, or maintenance personnel may be parked on the
street during daytime. The fine is $500 for each such hybrid violation;
         c.   Excessive noise on the property as defined in
10-13-23 (M) for a continuous period of 20 minutes or more based on the average
dB level. The fine is $2,000 for each such hybrid violation;
      3.   Violations. Violations may be a regulation violation, a civil
penalty, or a criminal citation. A violation notice may be issued by the
Community Development Department based on substantial evidence for any action
or inaction that violates the provisions of this section. Any owner, owner
occupant, or local property manager, may receive a violation notice if the
county finds they, or the property, violates any provision herein. Any
accumulation of three regulation violations, civil penalties, or criminal
citations, or any combination of them, may result in STR business license
denial, non-renewal, or revocation which is a final administrative decision of
the Community Development Department.
      4.   Three violations, two year revocation period. A Short Term Rental
License may not be renewed, or may be revoked, by the Community Development
Department for any violation of this section, or county, state or federal law
if the owner, owner-occupant or local property manager has been notified by the
department of a third violation, or for any additional violation thereafter.
The Short Term Rental License shall be revoked for the same dwelling, lot or
parcel for a period of two years, and a Notice of Non-Renewal or Revocation
shall be filed with the county recorder against the property evidencing the
license non-renewal or revocation, and mailed to the owner of record. After the
two year revocation period, the owner, owner occupant, or local property
manager, may reapply for a Short Term Rental License, and may obtain a license
if they meet all licensing criteria. After the two year revocation period, an
existing nonconforming property may reapply for a Short Term Rental License,
and may obtain a license if they meet all licensing criteria, except the
property does not have to meet the owner occupancy requirement or the square
footage requirement. If a new Short Term Rental License is issued, the county
will vacate the Notice of Non-Renewal or Revocation.
      5.   Five year violation reset. If a property with a Short Term Rental
License has not received three violations in a continuous five year period,
violations are reset to zero, and a new five year time period begins. If a
property has three or more violations in a continuous five year period, the
violations do not reset to zero, and the property is subject to enforcement
action.
      6.   Renewal or revocation. A license also may not be renewed, or may be
revoked, for:
         a.   Any action that endangers the public health, safety or welfare;
         b.   Failure to remit required taxes; or
         c.   Fraud, misrepresentation, or a false statement of material fact
in the license application as determined by the county.
      7.   Civil Penalty or Criminal Citation. An owner, owner-occupant, or
local property manager, or all (the “interested parties”), may be assessed a
civil penalty or be given a criminal citation if found in violation of the
provisions herein. For the first violation of this section, the interested
parties shall be given written notice of the violation, the possible civil and
criminal penalties, and reasonable opportunity to cure. If timely cured, it
still counts as a first violation, but no further action will be taken by the
county unless a second violation occurs. The county hereby adopts the following
civil penalty schedule:
         a.   First violation: warning letter.
         b.   Second violation: $500 a day until compliance or license
revocation.
         c.   Any additional violation thereafter: $1,000 a day until
compliance or license revocation.
         d.   Any criminal citation also is a violation, and successful
prosecution may result in fines or fees separate from civil penalties.
      8.   Prosecution. Any additional violation (after the first violation
warning letter, and the second violation) also may be prosecuted as a class B
misdemeanor. Each additional violation is a separate class B misdemeanor. (Ord.

10-15C-3: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
ACCENT OR     Lighting of building surfaces, landscape features, statues, and similar items for the
ARCHITECTURAL purpose of decoration, ornamentation, creation of visual hierarchy, sense of
LIGHTING:     liveliness, or other purpose unrelated to safety, business operation, or essential
              lighting function.
BACKLIGHT:    All the light emanating behind a luminaire.
              Backlight, uplight, and glare rating, which exists on a scale of zero to five and may
BUG RATING:   be used to describe luminaire optical performance in regard to light trespass, sky
              glow, and high angle brightness control.

              A specification of the color appearance of the light emitted by a lamp, relating its
CORRELATED    color to the color of light from a reference source when heated to a particular
COLOR         temperature, measured in kelvins (K). The CCT rating for a lamp is a general “warmth”
TEMPERATURE   or “coolness” measure of its appearance. Lamps with a CCT rating below 3,000 K are
(CCT):        usually considered “warm” sources, while those with a CCT above 3,000 K are usually
              considered “cool” in appearance.
              The area of intentional illumination emanating from a fixture generally formulated by
              shielding depth, illumination width, distance, and angle of illumination field,
              respective to the height and location of the illumination source, in context of
DIRECT        property location and grade. This illumination pattern is typically represented by the
ILLUMINATION: high intensity cone of light 10% or greater, emanating and expanding outward from the
              illumination source. This area is in contrast to the area outside of this high
              intensity cone, separately defined as light spill. Direct illumination shall be
              generally interpreted utilizing this formulation by the Community Development director
              or his designee.

Direct Illumination Formulation
 
 
            A fixture or bulb designed to “flood” an area with light. A specific form of
FLOODLIGHT: bulb or fixture designed to direct its output in a specific direction. Such
            bulbs are often designated by the manufacturer and are commonly used in
            residential outdoor lighting.
            An outdoor light fixture constructed and mounted, so the installed fixture emits
            no light above the horizontal plane. Where a light manufacturer provides a BUG
            rating, the uplight rating (U) must equal zero. Fully shielded light fixtures
            shall have its top and sides made of completely opaque material, so light only
FULLY       escapes through the bottom of the fixture. Fixtures with translucent or
SHIELDED    transparent sides, or sides with perforations or slits, do not qualify as fully
FIXTURE:    shielded. Any glass or diffuser on the bottom of the fixture must be flush with
            the fixture (no drop lenses). Surrounding structures, like canopies, eaves, and
            patio covers, are not to be considered when determining if the fixture is fully
            shielded. Fully shielded fixtures must be appropriately mounted, so the
            shielding prevents light from escaping above the horizontal plane, and all light
            is directed downward.

Examples of fully shielded light fixtures
 
                         The visual sensation caused by excessive brightness and which causes
GLARE:                   annoyance, discomfort, or a disability loss in visual performance or
                         visibility.
INTERNALLY ILLUMINATED:  As it relates to signs, means any sign which has a light source entirely
                         enclosed within the sign and not directly visible to the eye.
                         Any adverse effect of manmade light. Often used to denote “skyglow” from
LIGHT POLLUTION:         developed areas, but also includes glare, light trespass, visual clutter, and
                         other adverse effects of lighting.
LIGHT SOURCE:            The part of a lighting fixture that produces light, e.g., the bulb, lamp, or
                         chips on board (CoB).
LIGHT TRESPASS:          Direct illumination that falls beyond the boundaries of the property where it
                         originates.
                         A unit of luminous flux equal to the light emitted by a uniform point source
LUMEN:                   of one candle intensity. Lumens refers to the amount of light emitted by a
                         bulb (more lumens equate to brighter light).
MANUFACTURER’S CATALOG A publication or other printed material of a bulb or lighting manufacturer
CUTS:                    offering visual and technical information about a lighting fixture or bulb.
                         A complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp(s) and ballast(s) (when
OUTDOOR LIGHT FIXTURE:   applicable), together with the parts designed to distribute the light, to
                         position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.
                         Also known as a luminaire, or simply as a fixture.
RECREATIONAL LIGHTING:   Lighting used to illuminate sports fields, ball courts, playgrounds, or
                         similar outdoor recreational facilities.
                         The minimum amount of lighting required by the Building Official or Zoning
SAFETY LIGHTING:         Administrator for the purpose of safety, as required or prescribed by
                         standards and regulations specific to the application review. Examples

                         The brightening of the nighttime sky resulting from the scattering and
SKYGLOW:                 reflection of artificial light by moisture and dust particles in the
                         atmosphere. Skyglow is caused by light directed or reflected upwards or
                         sideways and reduces one’s ability to view the nighttime sky.
SPILL, LIGHT:            Illumination that reaches beyond the outside of the direct illumination area.
SPOTLIGHT:               A fixture or bulb designed to light a small area very brightly. See

                         Administrator.
TOTAL, LIGHT:            The sum of shielded and unshielded light.
TOTAL OUTDOOR LIGHT      The total amount of light, measured in lumens, from all installed outdoor
OUTPUT:                  light fixtures on a property, using each manufacturer’s initial rated lumen
                         output.
TOWER:                   Any monopole, antenna, or the like that exceeds 18 feet in height.
UNSHIELDED FIXTURE:      A fixture that has insufficient shielding to prevent light emission above the

10-18A-6: PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
   A.   Conditional Use Standards Of Review: When the planning commission acts
under its power to hear and decide applications for conditional uses, the
conditional use shall be approved if reasonable conditions are proposed to
mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed use in
accordance with the applicable standards as set forth below. If the reasonably
anticipated detrimental effects of a proposed conditional use cannot be
substantially mitigated by the imposition of reasonable conditions to achieve
compliance with applicable standards, the conditional use may be denied.
The planning commission shall make its decision based upon the facts presented
for the record. Expressions of support or opposition shall not constitute the
basis of approval or denial.
      1.   General Review Standards: An applicant for a conditional use in the
zone must demonstrate:
         a.   The use complies with all applicable provisions of Washington
County ordinances, state and federal law;
         b.   The use is not detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to
property or improvements in the vicinity. A proposed use shall be considered
detrimental:
            (1)   If it will cause unreasonable risks to the safety of persons
or property because of vehicular traffic or parking, or other similar
unreasonable risks; or
            (2)   If it will unreasonably interfere with the lawful use of
surrounding property;
         c.   The use is consistent with the characteristics and purposes
stated in the general plan, as amended;
         d.   The use is consistent with the characteristics and purposes
stated for the zone;
         e.   Site plan review:
            (1)   Traffic safety conditions are not adversely affected by the
use. The existence or need for dedicated turn lanes, pedestrian access, and
capacity of the existing streets shall be reviewed;
            (2)   Utility capacity is adequate;
            (3)   Emergency access is adequate;
            (4)   The location and design of parking both on site and off
street is adequate;
            (5)   A plan for fencing, screening, and landscaping to separate
the use from adjoining uses and mitigate the potential for conflict in uses is
adequate;
            (6)   Exterior lighting is adequate and does not unduly disturb the
surrounding area;
            (7)   Signage is adequate and in compliance with chapter 19 of this
title;
         f.   Requirements for the management and maintenance of facilities is
adequate;
         g.   The use shall not result in a situation which will create a need
for essential services which cannot be reasonably met by local service
providers, including roads and access for emergency vehicles and residents;
fire protection; police protection; schools and school busing; drinkable water;

Action authorized by approval of a conditional use permit must commence within
one year of the time the permit is issued. If at the end of one year,
authorized action has not commenced, the conditional use permit shall become
null and void unless a request is made for extension by the applicant. In
granting any request for extension, the planning commission shall find that
substantial work shall have been accomplished or that through no fault of the
applicant, it has been impossible to diligently pursue authorized action.
Extensions may be granted for periods of time not to exceed one year at each
extension. Once authorized action has commenced, the permit shall require no
further renewal unless required by the planning commission as a condition of
the permit.
If the approved use or activity ceases for any reason for a continuous period
of one year, the conditional use permit shall automatically terminate, as
having been abandoned. A new conditional use permit must be granted prior to
continuance of the conditional use.

Once granted, a conditional use shall not be enlarged, changed, extended,
increased in density or relocated unless a new conditional use application is
made and approved by the planning commission, except as provided below:
   A.   Modification to an approved conditional use permit may only be granted
when it can be determined that such changes or modifications are necessary to
accommodate special circumstances related to the location or implementation of
the approved conditional use, and where such modifications are found to be so
insignificant and minor so as not to measurably change the approved conditional
use permit or the intent of conditions that may have been imposed. The request
for the modification or amendment shall be made in writing and documented on
the site plan of the project.
   B.   Planning staff may review and approve the modification or amendments
that are insignificant and minor, but if the modification or amendment
significantly changes the conditional use, a new conditional use application
shall be filed and approved by the planning commission.
(Ord. 2012-1026-O, 12-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2022-1215, 8-2-2022)
10-18A-10: REVOCATION:
A conditional use permit may be revoked upon failure to comply with the
conditions imposed with the original approval of the permit and the applicant
shall be so notified of revocation by the county. The permit may be reinstated
upon determination by the planning commission that the cause for revocation has
been corrected and that the applicant intends to complete the project according
to the plan approved by the planning commission at the time the permit was
originally issued, or as it might have been properly amended by the planning
commission from time to time during construction of the conditional use.

10-21-5: FACILITY TYPES:
Wireless telecommunications facilities are characterized by the type or
location of the antenna structure. The general types of such antenna structures
and the standards for the installation of each type are as follows:
   A.   Monopole and lattice tower with antennas and antenna support
structures: A monopole or lattice tower is allowed as designed and engineered.
No such antenna shall be located within one hundred fifty feet (150') of a
residential zone unless approved by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 2017-1087-O,
4-18-2017)
10-21-6: ADDITIONAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Collocation: It is the policy of the County to encourage collocation of
facilities wherever feasible. The burden will be on the applicant to
demonstrate why collocation is not feasible.
   B.   Prohibited Areas: Monopoles or towers shall not be allowed within any
required front yard setback or within any required landscaped area, buffer area
or parking area.
   C.   Accessory Buildings To Antenna Structures: Accessory buildings to
antenna structures must comply with the required setback, height and
landscaping requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. All
tower sites shall be fenced with a six foot (6') vinyl coated chainlink fence
or other fencing as approved or required by the Planning Commission. The
climbing pegs shall be removed from the lower twenty feet (20') of all tower
types. All power lines on the lot leading to the accessory building and antenna
structure shall be underground.
   D.   Fence Requirement: Any commercial antennas under this chapter shall be
fenced.
   E.   Historic Districts: Any antenna proposed for a location within a

Director may require each nonmaintained or abandoned wireless
telecommunications tower or antenna to be removed from the building or premises
when such an antenna has not been repaired or put into use by the owner, person
having control, or person receiving benefit of such tower or antenna within
thirty (30) calendar days after notice of nonmaintenance or abandonment is
given to the owner, person having control, or person receiving the benefit of
such structure. The County may require a cash or surety bond to guarantee
removal of the tower and/or antenna. The bond amount shall be determined upon
review by County staff. Failure to remove antennas, monopoles, and/or lattice
towers after receiving written notice to remove is a violation of the terms of
this chapter.
   H.   Engineering Review:
      1.   The County may, if it deems necessary, cause each site to be
reviewed by a State qualified electrical engineer. The State qualified
electrical engineer may review the submitted information to determine if other
sites are available to achieve an equivalent signal distribution and not
significantly affect the operation of the wireless telecommunications facility.
Such a review shall be made when an applicant indicates that no other
acceptable site exists.
   I.   Permits: Prior to the construction of any facility, the applicant shall
obtain the proper building permits, encroachment permits and other permits as
required by County codes. (Ord. 2017-1087-O, 4-18-2017)

(R309-600 Utah administrative code). (Ord. 2011-1005-O, 2-15-2011)
   C.   Conflict: This chapter is designed to supplement, but not replace,
other ordinances and regulations governing the use of property within the
county, such as other regulations in this title. In case of conflict between
this chapter and any other applicable ordinance or regulation, the more
restrictive requirement shall prevail.
   D.   Degree Of Protection; Limitation Of Liability: The degree of protection
afforded by this chapter is considered adequate for regulatory purposes. This
chapter does not ensure that public drinking water sources will not be subject
to accidental or intentional contamination, nor does it create liability on the
part of the county, or an officer or employee thereof, for any damages to the
public water supplies from reliance on this chapter, nor any administrative
order lawfully made hereunder.
   E.   Owner Liability: A notice to cease or an exemption issued under this
chapter shall not relieve the owner of the obligation to comply with any other
applicable federal, state, regional or local regulations, rules, ordinances or
requirements, nor shall said notice or exemption relieve any owner of any
liability for violation of such regulations, rules, ordinances or requirements.

When used in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings given in this section:
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): A practice or combination of practices that
reduces the potential for spills and leaks at a site to occur and enter
groundwater. "BMPs" shall be construed within the context of this chapter to
include, but not be limited to, structural and nonstructural practices,
conservation practices, and operation and maintenance procedures identified by
the state department of environmental quality and the U.S. environmental
protection agency. "BMPs" should be the most effective practicable (including
technological, economic and institutional considerations) means of preventing
pollution sources from entering groundwater. "BMPs" may include, but not be
limited to, those practices outlined in the state department of environmental
quality pollution prevention fact sheets.
DESIGN STANDARD: A standard applied to the design, construction and ongoing
operation of various land use activities that imposes specific physical
requirements and that is implemented by a potential contamination source to
prevent discharges to the ground water. Examples of design standards include,
but are not limited to, facilities for segregating wastes for recovery and
separating hazardous and nonhazardous wastes to prevent cross contamination;
eliminating sources of leaks and spills; physical barriers, such as a berm or
dike, which will hold spills or leaks; use of double walled tanks to store
chemicals; locating storage and mixing areas away from floor drains, and waste
disposal procedures.
LANDFILL: A disposal site where solid wastes, including putrescible wastes or
hazardous wastes, are disposed of on land by placing earth cover thereon.
POLLUTION SOURCE: Point source discharges of contaminants to ground water or
potential discharges of the liquid forms of "extremely hazardous substances"
which are stored in containers in excess of "applicable threshold planning
quantities" as specified in SARA title III (42 USC 11002). Examples of possible
pollution sources include, but are not limited to, the following: storage
facilities that store the liquid forms of extremely hazardous substances,
septic tanks, drain fields, class V underground injection wells, landfills,
open dumps, land filling of sludge and septage, manure piles, salt piles, pit
privies, and animal feeding operations with more than ten (10) animal units.
The following clarify the definition of "pollution source":
   A.   Animal Feeding Operation: A lot or facility where the following
conditions are met: 1) animals have been or will be stabled or confined and fed
or maintained for a total of forty five (45) days or more in any twelve (12)
month period; and 2) crops, vegetation forage growth, or post harvest residues
are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or
facility. Two (2) or more animal feeding operations under common ownership are
considered to be a single feeding operation: 1) if they adjoin each other; 2)
if they use a common area; or 3) if they use a common system for the disposal
of wastes.
   B.   Animal Unit: A unit of measurement for any animal feeding operation
calculated by adding the following numbers: the number of slaughter and feeder
cattle multiplied by 1.0, plus the number of mature dairy cattle multiplied by
1.4, plus the number of swine weighing over fifty five (55) pounds multiplied
by 0.4, plus the number of sheep multiplied by 0.1, plus the number of horses
multiplied by 2.0.
   C.   Extremely Hazardous Substances: Those substances which are identified
in the section 302(EHS) column of the "Title III List Of Lists - Consolidated
List Of Chemicals Subject To Reporting Under SARA Title III", (EPA 560/4-91-
011).
POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION SOURCE: Any facility or site which employs an activity
or procedure which may potentially contaminate ground water as listed on
exhibit A of the EPA potential sources of drinking water contamination index. A
pollution source is also a potential contamination source.
SEPTIC TANK/DRAIN FIELD SYSTEMS: A system that is comprised of a septic tank
and a drain field which accepts domestic wastewater from buildings or
facilities for subsurface treatment and disposal. By their design, "septic
tank/drain field system discharges" cannot be controlled with design standards.
WELLHEAD: The upper terminal of a well, including adapters, ports, seals,
valves and other attachments. (Ord. 2004-844-O, 3-2-2004; amd. 2004 Code)

10-24-1: PURPOSE:
The county finds that the health, safety, and general public welfare of the
residents of the county will be promoted by establishing standards for the
development and grading (cuts or fills) on slope areas wherever development is
proposed to be located in the county. The purpose is to minimize soil and slope
instability and erosion, to minimize the adverse effects of grading, to
minimize subsurface water problems, preserve the character of the county's
developed hillsides, and to otherwise supplement and amplify the county
subdivision and zoning ordinances. The provisions herein are designed to
accomplish the following:
   A.   Prohibit development of uses which would likely result in a hazardous
situation due to slope instability, rockfalls, excessive soil erosion, or
expansive soils or subsurface water problems.
   B.   Provide for safe vehicular circulation and access.
   C.   Encourage preservation of open space by encouraging cluster housing,
density transfer, density bonus, or other design techniques, and to preserve
the natural terrain by protecting against slope failure from any of the above
identified conditions.
   D.   Protect against the above identified conditions in instances where
clustering or other design techniques may be used to preserve the natural
terrain. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-2: DEFINITIONS:
CUESTA: A land form that has a steep ascent in one direction and a gentle
descent in the opposite direction as designated on the ridgeline map. The steep
slope is the cuesta face, an erosion escarpment, and the gentle one is the back
slope of the cuesta. The crest of the cuesta forms a ridgeline.
CUT: Land surface which is reshaped by man through the removal of soil, rock,
or other materials.
DEVELOPMENT: The carrying out of any subdivision or building activity, or
clearing of land as an adjunct of construction. A development shall be
considered to be a subdivision, platting, including single-family residential,
townhomes, planned development, multi-family, commercial, and/or industrial
development.
DEVELOPMENT PARCEL: Any quantity of land capable of being described with such
definiteness that its location and boundaries may be established, which is
designated by its owner or development as land to be used or developed as a
unit or which has been used or developed as a unit.
EXCAVATION: Any disturbance to the ground, including, but not limited to,
clearing, grubbing, rock removal, cutting, tunneling, drilling, or any other
activity which alters the natural ground. "Minor excavation" shall mean a
vertical cut of four feet (4') or less, or a disturbance of less than ten
thousand (10,000) square feet of surface area.
FILL: The deposit of soil, rock, or other materials as placed by "man".
GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER: A person with a Master's Degree in Civil Engineering
with emphasis on geotechnical engineering from an accredited university who,
through training and experience, is able to assure that geological factors
affecting engineering works are recognized, adequately interpreted, and
presented for use in engineering practice, and for the protection of the
public. Such engineer shall be licensed in the state of Utah.
GRADING: Includes any work resulting in cuts or fills of an area of land
proposed for development purposes.
LEDGE: The first substantial abrupt change in slope along with the top edge of
a plateau or ridgeline.
PLATEAU: A flat or predominantly flat area of land which is raised sharply
above adjacent land on at least one side.
RIDGELINE: The junction of a rising steep slope on one side and a descending
slope that may either be gentle or steep on the other side.
SETBACK: An area in which no structure or building is allowed.
SLOPE: A vertical rise in feet measured over a horizontal distance, expressed
as a percentage.
TABLELAND: Land where the slope in any direction is less than fifteen percent
(15%).
UNDISTURBED LAND: An area that remains in a natural, pristine condition and is
not subject to grading, excavation, or other similar disturbance. (Ord. 2006-
910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-3: DISTURBANCE STANDARDS:
In furtherance of the purposes set forth above, site disturbance related to
hillside development shall comply with the following schedule:
   A.   Zero to nineteen percent (0-19%) slope: See existing ordinances and
standards unless otherwise required by the county.
   B.   Twenty to twenty nine percent (20-29%) slope: Seventy percent (70%) of
the slope shall remain undisturbed. The seventy percent (70%) area is based
upon the overall area/development rather than per lot.
   C.   Thirty percent (30%) and greater slope: Ninety percent (90%) of this
slope category shall remain undisturbed. The ninety percent (90%) area is based
upon the overall area/development rather than per lot.
   D.   The county commission shall have the authority to adjust the above
percentages, for cause, after receiving a recommendation from the county staff
and the land use authority. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-4: SLOPE AND SLOPE AREAS DETERMINED:
   A.   Slope: Slope shall be determined on an individual development parcel
basis as an average percent natural slope for purposes of density limitations.
   B.   Procedure: The location of the natural twenty percent (20%) to twenty
nine percent (29%) and thirty percent (30%) or greater slopes shall be
determined based upon the following procedure:
      1.   Preparation Of Contour Maps: Current contour maps shall be prepared
and certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor showing contours
at intervals no greater than five feet (5') drawn at a scale of not less than
one inch equals one hundred feet (1" = 100') scale.
      2.   Verification: Field surveys may be required of the applicant by the
county public works director to verify the accuracy of the contour lines shown
on the contour map. All development on slopes in excess of twenty percent (20%)
shall identify profile lines which shall be used for performing the field
survey. Profile lines shall be perpendicular to contour lines and in no case
occur at intervals greater than one hundred fifty feet (150') apart or seventy
five feet (75') from a property line. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-5: PERMIT REQUIRED:
All development on slopes in excess of twenty percent (20%) shall require a
grading development permit reviewed and recommended by the land use authority
and granted by the county commission prior to any grading or construction
activity. The county staff shall first review all proposed developments for
compliance with this and other county ordinances and standards, including the
Utah uniform building standards act rules, and the international building code,
and make a recommendation to the land use authority and to the county
commission for approval, conditional approval, or denial of the proposed
development. Developments shall be reviewed for suitable construction solutions
for addressing geologic hazards, expansive soils, landslides, rockfalls,
potential slope instability, and subsurface water, or other public health or
safety problems or issues.
The fee for the development permit shall be as may be established by the county
commission from time to time. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-6: APPLICATION REPORTS AND INFORMATION:

(20%) within the county shall be required to be submitted to the county staff
with the following technical information and reports:
   A.   An earth grading plan, prepared by a licensed civil or geotechnical
engineer. Said plan shall show (unless excepted by the county staff):
      1.   Existing and proposed contours and cross sections.
      2.   Accurate contours showing the topography of the existing ground, and
which must be extended at least two hundred feet (200') outside of all boundary
lines of the site, or sufficient to show on and off site drainage.
      3.   The slope of proposed cuts and fills shall be shown on the grading
plan.
      4.   Landscape or other approved techniques for stabilizing cuts and
fills.
      5.   All cuts and fills shall conform to the Utah uniform building
standards act rules, and the international building code.

systems and facilities, walls, cribbing or other erosion protection devices to
be constructed in connection with, or as a part of, the proposed project,
together with a map showing the drainage area and estimated runoff of the area
served by any drainage system or facility. The drainage plan will show plans
for protecting expansive areas that may be a part of the overall development.
   C.   A plan showing all existing or proposed streets, buildings, easements,
or drainage channels on or proposed to be located on the property.
   D.   Elevation drawings showing the location of all existing and proposed
structures and how or to what extent hillside cuts or fills will be covered
and/or retained by the proposed development.
   E.   An earth grading plan prepared by a licensed professional engineer

   F.   Drainage control plan and report.
      1.   All drainage systems shall be separate and independent from the
sanitary sewer system.
      2.   Drainage and flood control shall be designed in conformance with the
county flood control master plan where applicable.
      3.   When modification to a natural drainage channel is proposed within
the development, such changes will be addressed in the drainage study and shown
on the improvement plans. The developer may be required to dedicate rights of
way or to record drainage easements for structures and/or improvements needed
to carry storm water runoff in the event approval is given for the proposed
modifications. The developer shall be required to check with other agencies
besides the county to determine whether or not such agency claims some
jurisdiction over the land in question.
      4.   The point of location where the natural drainage channel enters and
leaves the property may not be changed without approval of the county.
      5.   Any drainage basins located upstream of the development shall be
considered to be fully developed in conformance with the county's current land
use plan. Effects on the downstream property owners relative to increased flood
potential and nuisance water shall also be considered in the design, including
acquisition of easements or agreements where necessary, or construction or
modification of improvements where needed.
      6.   The developer shall provide the necessary means to assure drainage
within the property being developed by making use of existing facilities or
natural washes and constructing other planned improvements.
      7.   In general, it shall be required that each new development handle
its storm water runoff in such a manner that no net increase in storm runoff
above the natural state will occur on the downstream properties. In other
words, the preproject flows must not be exceeded by the postproject flows.
      8.   Streets are significant and important in urban drainage, and full
use shall be made of streets for storm runoff up to reasonable limits,
recognizing that the primary purpose of streets is for traffic. Reasonable
limits of the use of streets for transportation of storm runoff shall be
governed by the below listed design criteria:
         a.   Local street: No curb overtopping. Flow spread must leave at
least one lane free of water.
         b.   Collector street: No curb overtopping. Flow spread must leave one
lane free of water in each direction (2 lanes minimum).
      9.   When the above encroachment is exceeded, an independent storm water
system shall be designed and constructed based upon a 10-year storm. The
minimum storm drain size shall be twelve inches (12").
      10.   The storm water from a 100-year frequency storm shall be adequately
conveyed either within the limits of the street rights of way or in storm drain
easements without creating flood hazards to dwellings.
      11.   When an underground piping system is required, it shall be designed
to carry a 10-year storm. Major hydraulic structures shall be designed to carry
a 100-year storm.
      12.   Retention and detention basins on hillsides shall not be allowed.
      13.   Cross gutter drains on streets shall be avoided wherever possible.
They shall not be allowed on collector and higher order streets.
      14.   When springs or other ground water sources are found on or above
the developer's property, the construction of an engineered underground pipe
system to eliminate the nuisance of this water will be required. Minimum pipe
size shall be eight inches (8"). Plans shall be approved by the county public
works director.
      15.   Necessary measures shall be taken to prevent erosion and scour at
all points throughout the development. It shall be mitigated at all points of
discharge and at the face of any cut or fill slope throughout the development.
      16.   During grading or construction on any property, including off site
construction, the developer shall control both water used for construction and
storm runoff in such a manner as to not adversely affect any adjoining
properties, nor add silt or debris to any existing storm drain, wash, channel
or roadway.
   G.   The drainage plans and construction drawings shall be approved by the
county public works director prior to final plat approval or site approval and
prior to the issuance of any building permits. The report shall be prepared in
conformance with general accepted engineering practices.
   H.   A geology and soils report shall be prepared by a licensed professional
engineer trained and experienced in the practice of geotechnical engineering in
the area proposed for development, and shall be reviewed by the county public
works and the land use authority. The report shall contain at least the
following information:
      1.   A slope stability analysis shall be prepared containing conclusions
and recommendations concerning the effects of a grading operation, introduction
of water, both on and off site, including, where applicable, on mesa tops,
seismic activity, and erosion on slope stability.
      2.   A foundation investigation with conclusions and recommendations
concerning the effects of soil conditions on foundation and structural
stability, including, where applicable, sheer strength, and shrink/swell
potential of soils.
      3.   The location and yield of springs and seeps which shall be shown on
the site plan.
      4.   Structural features including any geological limitations.
      5.   Existence of surface hazards including potential for failure of
slopes or rock overhangs above the subject property.
      6.   Conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of geologic
conditions on the proposed development, together with recommendations
identifying the means proposed to minimize any hazards to life or property, or
adverse impact on the natural environment.
   I.   Prior to final plat or site plan approval of a project, a landscape
plan, prepared by a licensed landscape contractor or a landscape architect, in
conjunction with the overall site plan, must be submitted for approval. The
plan shall outline areas being excavated and filled and describe in detail how
the developer will restore or replant these areas. The plan shall specify types
of temporary or permanent retention being used, together with sprinkler plans
and water usage methods suitable to the soils of the project.
   J.   Other reports, plans, and information as may be deemed necessary by the
county staff or public works director may be requested as a condition of the
application. All studies and plans shall require review by the public works
director. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-7: PROPERTY MITIGATION:
A cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit to assure hillside restoration
shall be provided prior to issuance of a hillside development permit for
projects disturbing more than one acre, or where the public works director
recommends and the land use authority approves that a bond or letter of credit
is needed on a site of less than one acre. Such financial guarantee shall be
provided in an amount sufficient to ensure necessary soil stabilization,
including grading, planting, and maintenance. In the event that the developer
fails to complete the hillside restoration in accordance with the approved plan
within one year from the issuance of the permit, and upon recommendation of the
staff and approved by the land use authority, additional time may be granted by
the county commission in the event that significant progress toward completion
of the project is underway. The bond or letter of credit shall cover the cost,
as estimated by an approved landscape architect, qualified contractor, or civil
or geotechnical engineer, and approved by the public works director, to restore
the hillside to an acceptable level of appearance and stability. If the work is
not completed as agreed upon at the time of the issuance of the permit, the
county may call the bond or letter of credit and the county shall be
responsible to complete the work. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-8: STREET DESIGN:
The following standards apply to all public streets. (See subsection 11-5-3C5
of this code for street width requirements.)
   A.   All street grades shall be a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). However,
when conditions can be made more desirable by exceeding fifteen percent (15%)
and produce less disturbance to the existing terrain, along with improvement in
safety features, upon recommendation of the public works director and approved
by the land use authority, grades may exceed the fifteen percent (15%) limit
based on the merits of each case.
   B.   Where at all possible, all intersections shall be ninety degree (90°)
angles. In the event an acute angle intersection is required, it can be
mitigated by realigning to achieve a ninety degree (90°) intersection using a
fifty foot (50') section prior to the PC of the curve or a landing area design
in which a vehicle is brought ninety degrees (90°) to the intersecting road.
   C.   Intersections should be spaced far enough apart so that the traffic
stopped to make left turns at one intersection does not interfere with traffic
movements at the adjacent intersections. On low volume streets such as access
from one local street to another, the minimum distance should be two hundred
feet (200'). For local to collector streets the minimum distance should be two
hundred fifty feet (250').
   D.   The design of geometric features such as horizontal and vertical
alignment will depend on the design speed selected for each street. The design
speed is primarily determined by the street function and classification, and is
the maximum speed for safe and comfortable operation of a vehicle. Other than a
collector, all streets in hillside areas are classified as local streets with a
speed of thirty five (35) miles per hour or less. The use of design speeds
other than those listed must be approved by the public works director, who may
decide that the speed provided in this section be reduced to that which is
reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and
potential hazards.
 
Street Design Classification Speed Design Speed Posted
Local street                 25 - 30 mph  25 mph
Collector street             30 mph       30 mph
Hillside local street        251 mph      251 mph
 
Note:
1.   The variance of design speeds may be granted by the public works director
to no greater than 5 miles per hour or less when conditions warrant. Variances
will not be granted for short segments of roads, but for entire contiguous
stretches so that consistency and driver expectancy are maintained.
   E.   At intersections, adequate, clear sight distance should be provided to
permit drivers entering the street to see approaching traffic from a long
enough distance to allow them to decide when to enter the street safely, turn
onto the street, and accelerate in advance of approaching traffic. Clear sight
distance should be in accordance with the following table:
 
   Post   Minimum Clea   Desired
   Spee   Sight Distan   Sight Distance
20 mph    210 feet          240 feet
25 mph    260 feet          300 feet
30 mph    310 feet          380 feet
35 mph    365 feet          475 feet
 
   F.   The vertical alignment of residential streets should ensure that
drivers can safely negotiate hills in adverse weather and that sight distances
are adequate for safety. The requirements for vertical curve design shall be in
accordance with the latest editions of AASHTO geometric design of highways and
streets. All designs shall be approved by the county public works director.
Vertical alignment with the intersection is also of special nature, and design
alternatives may be required. As a guideline, the approach area where vehicles
stop while waiting to enter an intersection shall not exceed four (4) to five
percent (5%) from the gutter line of the street being intersected for a
distance of fifty feet (50') though a range of fifty feet (50') to one hundred
feet (100') is more desirable. This applies to all intersections, except those
intersections where both intersecting streets are collectors. The landing area
for a collector street shall be designed for a grade of two percent (2%) to
three percent (3%) for a distance of one hundred feet (100').
   G.   The minimum sight distance to be provided before a stop is required
shall comply with the requirements set forth in the table below:
 
Design Speed    Minimum        Add On For 15 Percent Grade Distance
                Stopping Distance
20 mph          125 feet       20 feet
25 mph          150 feet       36 feet
30 mph          197.5 feet     64 feet
35 mph          250 feet       95 feet
 
   H.   The minimum centerline radius for horizontal curves on local streets is
outlined as follows:
 
Speed   Curve Radius In Feet
20 mph  100
25 mph  185
30 mph  310
 
   I.   The minimum requirements for street cross section configurations are
based on the following factors:
      1.   Traffic capacity,
      2.   Design speed,
      3.   Projected traffic,
      4.   Designs to reduce scarring.
Alternate street cross sections may be used if applicable safety and traffic
standards are met and approved by the public works director. (See Washington
County construction standards to identify alternates that may be available.)
(Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-9: BUILDING SETBACKS AND ADDITIONAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   For safety purposes, all ridgelines, plateaus, and cuestas shall be a
minimum of fifty feet (50') away from any building construction or further
development unless a greater setback is required as recommended in the
geotechnical report.
   B.   Retaining walls should be colored to match surrounding natural
landscaping.
   C.   The exterior color of buildings on hillside slopes above twenty percent
(20%) should be earthtone to blend with the surrounding natural landscape.
   D.   "No disturbance" areas shall not be included within lots unless
approved by the land use authority and county commission, but should be part of
the common area of a project. Common areas shall be owned and maintained by the
project's homeowners' association, or may be deeded to the county upon county
commission approval.
      1.   No disturbance areas shall be identified on the ground with
temporary fencing or other approved means to prevent accidental disturbance of
the area during construction. Such fencing shall be installed prior to issuance
of a grading permit.
      2.   No disturbance areas shall be identified on final plats or site
plans, whichever is applicable. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-10: APPEALS:
In the event that the county staff makes requirements which are not acceptable
to the developer, the developer may request a hearing of the matter by the
county commission. Said request shall be made in writing and submitted within
ten (10) calendar days thereafter. The county commission shall hear and make
final determination of the issue. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-11: PENALTY:
In addition to those penalties prescribed in subsections 10-1-21A and B of this
title, the public works director or building official shall have the right to
order a halt to construction of any improvements within a hillside development
where, at their discretion, there exists a condition which violates, or
threatens to violate, any provisions of this chapter. Such suspension of
construction activities shall continue until the public works director, or
building official, is satisfied that measures have been implemented for
substantial compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
10-24-12: EXEMPTION:
Notwithstanding the requirements of this chapter, the requirements herein are
intended to apply to any and all development projects proposing to develop land
for residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions, and/or planned
development purposes. Grading for strictly mining or mineral development,
unless otherwise required by the public works director, is exempt from this
chapter. (Ord. 2006-910-O, 5-2-2006)
CHAPTER 25
WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES
SECTION:
10-25-1: Purpose
10-25-2: Definitions
10-25-3: Requirements; Wind Energy System, Small
10-25-4: Requirements; Wind Energy System, Large
10-25-5: Requirements Of Wind Monitoring Tower And Equipment (Met Tower)
10-25-6: Nonuse
10-25-7: Applicability
10-25-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum requirements and
regulations for the placement, construction and modification of small wind
energy systems, commercial wind energy systems, and wind metering towers and
equipment, as defined herein, while promoting the safe, effective and efficient
use of such systems. (Ord. 2010-993-O, 4-20-2010)
10-25-2: DEFINITIONS:
SHADOW FLICKER: Alternating changes in light intensity caused by the moving
blade of a wind energy system casting shadows on an object, such as a window.
TOTAL EXTENDED HEIGHT: The distance measured from ground level to the tip of
the blade, extended at its highest point of travel.
TOWER: The supporting structure on which the turbine is mounted.
TURBINE: That portion of the wind system that is used to capture the energy of
the wind and transform it into electrical or mechanical energy. The turbine
includes a rotor (blades) and nacelle (generator), and on many wind systems a
tail.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, LARGE: A wind energy conversion system consisting of one or
more wind turbine(s) and tower(s), with associated control or conversion
electronics, which will be used for on site and/or off site consumption of
power with a rated capacity in excess of one hundred (100) kilowatts.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, SMALL: A wind energy conversion system consisting of one or
more wind turbine(s), a tower or other support structure, and associated
control or conversion electronics with a rated capacity appropriate to the on
site electric usage of the end use and which will be used primarily to reduce
on site consumption of utility power. A small wind energy system may have a
rated capacity of up to one hundred (100) kilowatts.
WIND MONITORING TOWER AND EQUIPMENT; METEOROLOGICAL (MET) TOWER: A tower that
houses or supports wind measuring equipment, such as an anemometer, for the
purpose of measuring and monitoring wind velocity, duration, intensity,
regularity, air temperature and pressure, etc. Met towers are typically
permitted only on a temporary basis (2 to 5 years) to help determine the
viability of a wind energy system project; although more permanent met towers
may also be considered.
WIND TURBINE, HORIZONTAL AXIS (HAWT): A wind turbine designed to have the axis
of rotation aligned with the direction of the wind, such as with the common
propeller type models. These turbines have a rotor revolving about a horizontal
axis. They look like a small airplane with a large propeller and no wings, and
are the most common variety.
WIND TURBINE, VERTICAL AXIS (VAWT): A wind turbine designed to have the axis of
rotation perpendicular to the wind direction. (Ord. 2010-993-O, 4-20-2010)
10-25-3: REQUIREMENTS; WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, SMALL:
   A.   Permitted Locations And Number: A small wind energy system that
complies with the provisions of this section is permitted only as described in
table of uses, Washington County zoning ordinance.
   B.   Minimum Lot Size: A horizontal axis small wind energy system may only
be erected on a lot that is capable of meeting the setback requirements of this
section. A vertical axis small wind energy system, whether mounted vertically
or horizontally, may be erected on a lot that is capable of meeting the setback
requirements of this section. The fall zone limits the lot size requirement as
the tower does not cross the property line in which it is erected.
   C.   Design Standards:
      1.   Pole Or Tower Design: The design of the small wind energy system may
include a monopole/freestanding design, or a guywired tower, whether mounted on
the ground or on a building.
      2.   Total Extended Height: The total extended height of the small wind
energy system shall not exceed thirty five feet (35'). Otherwise, exceptions to
the height limitations shall be approved by the land use authority as a
conditional use permit. Sufficient clearance to lower and raise the tower and
turbine is to be provided and maintained.
      3.   Safety:
         a.   The minimum height of the lowest extent of a turbine blade/rotor
shall be twenty feet (20') above the ground, if on a horizontal axis turbine.
There is no minimum rotor height for a vertical axis turbine, provided the
blades/rotor must be located or isolated (e.g., fenced) such that they are not
easily accessible to anyone but maintenance personnel.
         b.   No tower shall have an external climbing apparatus within twelve
feet (12') of the ground. All access doors or accessways to towers and
electrical equipment shall be locked when not in use.
         c.   Appropriate warning signage/marking is to be placed on towers,
guywires, and electrical equipment.
         d.   All small wind energy systems must have a manufacturers' maximum
RPM (revolutions per minute) rating of less than five hundred (500).
         e.   Small wind turbines that are operating erratically shall be shut
down and/or lowered to the ground. Examples of erratic operation include, but
are not limited to, the following:
            (1)   Unusual noises such as those indicating failure of bearings.
            (2)   Unusual vibrations such as those indicating that the rotor is
out of balance.
            (3)   Falling or loosely hanging parts, such as tail vanes.
      4.   Setbacks: In determining the required separation of a small wind
energy system from the uses listed, all applicable setbacks are to be followed;
where multiple setbacks are applicable, the most restrictive applies.
         a.   Property Lines: For safety purposes, a small wind energy system
shall be set back from the nearest property line, public road right of way,
tanks containing combustible/flammable liquids, and aboveground communication
or electrical lines not less than 1.1 times its total extended height if
located on a freestanding tower or pole, or if mounted on a building, the
distance of the likely fall zone.
Additional setbacks from neighboring residences and residentially zoned lots
are set forth in subsection C5 of this section.
      5.   Noise Limitations And Additional Setbacks: To reduce noise impacts
to neighboring residential properties, no small wind energy system or
combination of small wind energy systems shall produce noise that exceeds fifty
(50) dBA, as measured at the property line of any neighboring residentially
zoned lot not owned by the small wind energy system developer. (Note: Public
road right of way counts towards the setback.)
         a.   Separation Of Multiple Systems: If more than one small wind
energy system is proposed and the setback from a neighboring residence or
residential property line is applicable, professional documentation (e.g., a
noise study) shall be submitted indicating that the above noise limitations
will be met. A situation with multiple small wind energy systems must consider
the effects of combined noise levels (may add up to 3 dB) and the appropriate
sound propagation calculations (whether line source properties apply to the
situation).
         b.   Single Systems: To establish the minimum setback(s) necessary to
comply with the above noise limitations in situations of single wind energy
systems, the applicant shall provide from a reliable source the noise emission
level (a.k.a. noise rating) of the system, as measured at a specified distance
from the rotor or tower and at a given wind speed (e.g., 52 decibels at 100
feet from the tower, 30 miles per hour wind). Any noise rating must be based on
at least a ten (10) meters per second (22.3 miles per hour) wind speed to
qualify for use. If the proposed setback is at least as far as the distance
used for the noise rating, and the noise rating is less than the above noise
limits, then no further calculations are necessary. Otherwise, the following
calculations can be utilized to determine if the proposed setback is sufficient
to comply with the above noise limits:
Step 1: Calculate the difference in decibels (dB) that would occur at the
neighboring residential property line and/or residence, as applicable, versus
the noise level at the distance used for the noise rating statement.
Equation: dB difference = 20 x log10 of (distance A/distance B)
Where "distance A" is the distance from the system used to establish the noise
rating, and "distance B" is the proposed distance between the wind energy
system and the neighboring residential property line and/or residence. Log10
stands for logarithm to the base 10. (Note: Simplified calculators are
available on the internet. The above equation is based on the general rule that
sound in the clearly audible frequency range will reduce 6 dB for every
doubling of distance from the source, assuming a single source of sound.)
Step 2: The result of the above equation is a negative number, which represents
the reduction in decibels from distance A to distance B. Subtract the absolute
value (positive equivalent) of that number from the noise rating of the system
and compare the answer to the applicable maximum allowable noise level (50
dBA). If the result is less than the maximum allowable noise level, the
proposed location is acceptable, provided all other applicable setbacks are
met.
In situations where a noise rating is not available on a specific model, the
county may either require a noise study to be performed by a qualified
professional, or make a conservative estimate based on a wind energy system of
similar characteristics (blade type and size, RPM speed, rated output, rotor
diameter, startup speed, etc.) plus a safety factor of three (3) dB to
establish the required setback.
Compliance with the setbacks established through the above equation shall be
deemed sufficient to comply with the noise limitations of this subsection C5,
for permitting and enforcement purposes; provided, failure of the system to
operate at or below the rated noise emission level due to worn, damaged, or
broken parts, shall constitute noncompliance and the system shall be shut down
until repairs are made to bring the system back into compliance. High wind
occurrences may result in noise levels above that calculated, as the noise
ratings are based on high, but not extreme wind speeds; noise resulting from
such high wind occurrences does not constitute noncompliance with this section.
If the noise rating is based on one hundred feet (100') from the source, the
following table may be used for quick reference. If the noise rating is based
on fifty feet (50') from the source, simply subtract six (6) dB from the noise
rating and follow the row across to find the setback equivalents. If the noise
rating is based on some other distance, use the equation above. (Note: The
following table is not applicable to situations with multiple small wind energy
systems or to commercial wind energy systems.)

      6.   Visual Standards:
         a.   Small wind energy systems are to be finished and maintained as
manufactured.
         b.   No small wind energy system shall be lighted unless required by
the federal aviation administration (FAA). When lighting is required by the
FAA, it shall be the red, intermittent, glowing style, rather than the white,
strobe style, unless disclosed and justified through the application review
process.
         c.   No advertising signs of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be
permitted on any small wind energy system.
         d.   The design of any accessory buildings or related structures
shall, to the extent reasonably possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend the facility into the natural setting
and existing environment.
         e.   The property owner shall reasonably attempt to site the system at
a location that minimizes the potential for shadow flicker impacts to their own
and neighboring residences.
      7.   Electrical Interconnections: All electrical interconnection or
distribution lines shall be underground and comply with all applicable codes
and public utility requirements.
      8.   Signal Interference: Efforts shall be made to site small wind energy
systems to reduce the likelihood of blocking or reflecting television and other
communication signals. If signal interference occurs, both the small wind
energy system owner and individual receiving interference shall make reasonable
efforts to resolve the problem. No small wind energy system shall cause
permanent and material interference with television or other communication
signals.
      9.   Overspeed Controls: Every small wind energy system is to be equipped
with an automatic overspeed control, braking system, or feathering system.
         a.   Small wind turbines must have some positive means of shutdown.
Examples of acceptable means for shutting the turbine down include, but are not
limited to: dynamic braking (usually accomplished by shorting the alternator
phases together); mechanical brakes that slow and then lock the rotor.
         b.   Small wind turbines must have some means of controlling the
rotational speed of the turbine rotor in high winds. Examples of acceptable
means of control include, but are not limited to, furling mechanically forced
yawing, and blade pitch control. VAWT type small wind turbines, which cannot
use the above controls, must still incorporate some other means, such as
braking.
      10.   Fire Protection: All small wind energy systems are to be provided
with a defensible space for fire protection, in accordance with the Washington
County wildland urban interface code.
   D.   Permit Applications: A building permit is required for a small wind
energy system. The application is to include the following information:
      1.   Site Plan: A site plan, drawn to scale, showing the location of the
proposed small wind energy system; the locations of all existing buildings and
structures, dimensioned to the property lines; the location of any septic
system, well, utility line or easement, access easement, or any tank containing
flammable materials on the property; the area required for raising and lowering
the tower; the defensible space area required by the urban wildlands interface
code; and the applicable setbacks for the small wind energy system.
      2.   Noise Compliance Documentation: Provide the information necessary to
demonstrate that the applicable noise requirements of subsection C5 of this
section will be met.
      3.   Standard Drawings: Engineered plans and calculations shall be
required to obtain a building permit for a small wind energy system. Plans and
calculations shall be stamped, dated and signed in accordance with Utah state
codes, ordinances, and laws governing such actions, by an engineer licensed and
in good standing with the state of Utah. Plans and calculations must verify
that the structure is designed and capable of withstanding the conditions of
the site, including, but not limited to, wind load, snow load, seismic
conditions, and soil conditions, as required by the Washington County building
department. Soils testing by a qualified soils engineer that is licensed by,
and in good standing with, the state of Utah may be required.
      4.   Specification Sheet: Specific information on the type, model, size,
rotor material, rated power output, rated rotor speed, overspeed safety
features, and survival wind speed, as well as the name and address of the
manufacturer is to be provided. These items are typically included in a
specification sheet available from the manufacturer.
      5.   Line Drawing: A line drawing of the electrical components of the
system in sufficient detail to establish that the installation conforms to all
applicable electrical codes.
      6.   Net Metering Agreement: If the system will be connected to the
electricity grid the applicant must provide documentation with the building
permit that the required net metering agreement is being considered by the
utility company (e.g., work order number status). The fully executed net
metering agreement must be provided to the building inspector prior to
operation of a system that will be connected to the grid. (Ord. 2010-993-O, 4-
20-2010)
10-25-4: REQUIREMENTS; WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, LARGE:
The following standards shall apply to all large wind energy systems:
   A.   Wind Energy Application: A large wind energy system may be permitted as
described in table of uses, Washington County zoning ordinance.
   B.   Design Standards: A large wind energy system shall comply with the
design standards set forth below.
      1.   Pole Or Tower Design: The design of the large wind energy system
shall be of monopole or freestanding design with no guywired towers. No open
lattice style towers are permitted, unless they are entirely clad with a
suitable cover, such as an architectural fabric, and engineered to consider the
additional forces related to the covering.
      2.   Minimum Blade Height: The minimum height of the lowest extent of a
turbine blade shall be thirty feet (30') above the ground and fifteen feet
(15') above any structure or obstacle within the fall zone of the tower.
      3.   Safety/Access:
         a.   No tower shall have an exterior climbing apparatus within twelve
feet (12') of the ground. All access doors or accessways to towers and
electrical equipment shall be locked.
         b.   Appropriate warning signage shall be placed on towers, electrical
equipment and wind energy system entrances.
      4.   Setbacks: In determining the required separation of a large wind
energy system from the uses listed, all applicable setbacks are to be followed;
where multiple setbacks are applicable, the most restrictive applies.
         a.   Project Boundary Lines: A commercial wind energy system tower
shall be set back from all project boundary lines, existing publicly maintained
roads, tanks containing combustible/flammable liquids, and aboveground
communication or electrical lines, not less than 1.25 times its total extended
height.
         b.   Other Uses: No large wind energy system shall be located within
one-half (1/2) mile of a park, church, hospital, school, playground, or
residentially zoned lot not owned or leased by the wind energy developer.
Additional separation may be required to sufficiently mitigate noise and shadow
flicker resulting from the commercial wind energy system.
         c.   Spacing: Large wind energy system towers shall be spaced on
center no closer than 1.1 times the total extended height.
Additional setbacks from neighboring residences and residentially zoned lots
are set forth in subsections B5 and B7e of this section for noise and shadow
flicker.
      5.   Noise: Except when a professional noise study is submitted that
properly demonstrates that the noise thresholds specified below will not be
exceeded with a lesser setback, all commercial wind energy turbines shall be
located a minimum of 1.25 miles from all existing inhabitable structures
(residences, places of work, etc.) and residentially zoned lots that are not
owned or leased by the wind energy developer. Provided, in situations of
mountainous topography where the sound could be reflected/channeled towards a
residential area, or when the proposed wind turbines are rated more than 3.0
MW, the land use authority may determine that a noise study is warranted to
ensure sufficient setbacks to meet the following noise thresholds. With the
exception of such an instance, compliance with the 1.25 miles setback shall be
deemed sufficient to be in compliance with the noise restrictions for
commercial wind energy systems and a noise study is not needed. A noise study,
when required, shall be peer reviewed by an independent qualified party, with
the associated costs borne by the developer. If a reduced setback is
authorized, failure to operate within the noise limits specified constitutes a
violation of this chapter.
         a.   Thresholds For Noise Studies: No large wind energy system shall
produce sound at any time, as measured at any neighboring residentially zoned
lot or one hundred feet (100') from any existing inhabitable building that is
not owned or leased by the wind energy developer, that exceeds the lesser of:
            (1)   Thirty five (35) dBA (LAeq);
            (2)   Five (5) dB above the preexisting (L90), nighttime background
noise level of the area (measured in contiguous 10 minute intervals), whether
measured as dBA (LAeq) or dBC (LCeq);
            (3)   Fifty five (55) dBC (LCeq) if measured in a rural environment
(outside a tier I, II or III area);
            (4)   Sixty (60) dBC (LCeq) if measured in a suburban environment
(within a tier I, II or III area);
            (5)   Provided, a five (5) dB penalty shall be applied for
amplitude modulation; meaning the maximum sound threshold is five (5) dB less
than the amount specified in subsection B5a(1) of this section.
All procedures relating to sound measurement are to comply with standard
professional practices, such as ANSI 12.9, part 3, and be conducted by
qualified acoustical consultants. To avoid errors in the estimates and to
properly account for worst case scenarios of sound generation, the calculations
must include the five (5) dBA penalty/addition for amplitude modulation (the
spike above the average noise level as a blade passes the tower, which is a 5
dBA spike when the blades from 2 or more turbines are synchronized), the
addition of three (3) dB for coherent reflection (additional sound reflecting
off the ground), and consideration of the additional sound created by turbulent
inflow (atmospheric turbulence due to wind shear, etc.).
      6.   Setback And Noise Waivers: Voluntary waivers or reductions of the
setback and noise limits established by subsections B4a, B4b, and B5 of this
section may be accepted from those neighboring property owners that otherwise
would be within a setback required by one or more of these sections. The
agreement(s) must specifically state the county setback and/or noise standard
(s) being waived or reduced, the extent of the waiver, and be in the form of a
legally binding contract or easement between the landowner (including assignees
in interest) and the wind energy developer, effective for the life of the
project. Notwithstanding any such voluntary agreement between the landowner and
the wind energy developer, the agreement shall only be effective and reflected
in the county's authorization of the project when it has been reviewed and
determined acceptable to the county. The county shall consider the likely
impacts and consequences of the waiver or reduction of the setback and/or noise
limit, based on the specific circumstances of the situation, in determining
whether to grant the request. Any voluntary waiver or reduction agreement must
be submitted with the conditional use permit application and if authorized by
the county, must be filed with the county recorder upon issuance of the
conditional use permit.
      7.   Visual Appearance:
         a.   Large wind energy systems shall be finished and maintained in
color and material as manufactured.
         b.   No large wind energy system shall be lighted unless required by
the federal aviation administration (FAA). When lighting is required by the
FAA, it shall be the red, intermittent, glowing style, rather than the white,
strobe style, unless disclosed and justified through the application review
process.
         c.   No advertising signs of any kind or nature shall be permitted on
any large wind energy system.
         d.   Accessory buildings or related structures shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, use materials, colors, and textures that will blend the
facility into the existing environment.
         e.   Large wind energy systems must be located such that they will not
result in any significant amount of shadow flicker on a major public roadway,
or on any inhabitable structures or residentially zoned lots not owned or
leased by the wind project developer/lessor, unless an easement to do so is
obtained from the affected property owner and presented with the application. A
shadow flicker analysis is required with the application if there are any
inhabitable structures or residentially zoned lots not owned or leased by the
wind energy developer, or major public roadways, within 1.25 miles of the
turbine.
         f.   Appropriate landscaping or screening materials may be required to
help screen accessory structures from major roads and adjacent residences.
Lighting of accessory structures and substations shall be limited to the
minimum necessary and full cutoff lighting (e.g., dark sky compliant) may be
required for accessory structures when determined necessary to mitigate visual
impacts.
      8.   Electrical Interconnections: All electrical interconnection and
distribution lines within the project boundary shall be underground, unless
determined otherwise by the planning commission because of severe environmental
constraints (e.g., wetlands, cliffs, hard bedrock), and except for power lines
within a substation. All electrical interconnections and distribution
components must comply with all applicable codes and public utility
requirements. Transmission lines (33.5 kV lines and above) coming to or leaving
the project may be overhead.
      9.   Signal Interference: Efforts shall be made to site large wind energy
systems to reduce the likelihood of blocking or reflecting television and other
communication signals. If signal interference occurs, both the commercial wind
energy system owner and individual receiving interference shall make reasonable
efforts to resolve the problem. No commercial wind energy system shall cause
permanent and material interference with television, cellular, or other
communication signals.
      10.   Fire Protection: All wind energy systems shall have a defensible
space for fire protection in accordance with the Iron County wildland urban
interface code.
   C.   Permit Applications: An application for a conditional use permit to
establish a commercial wind energy system shall include a complete description
of the project and documentation to sufficiently demonstrate that the
requirements set forth in subsection B of this section will be met. Supporting
documentation for addressing the review criteria of subsection D of this
section and subsection 10-25-5A of this chapter is also to be provided. The
land use authority may require any information reasonably necessary to
determine compliance with this section.
It is preferred that any related conditional use permit applications for
substations or transmission lines be considered in conjunction with the
conditional use permit application for the large wind energy system; however,
if the details of those improvements are not available at the time of
application for the large wind energy system, they may be considered later,
through subsequent conditional use permit review. At a minimum, the intended
route for connecting to the power grid and the alternative locations of any
substation shall be disclosed with the application for the large wind energy
system.
Due to the complexity of large scale large wind energy projects, the county may
require a development agreement or other appropriate instrument to address
taxing, land use, property assessment, and other issues related to the project.
For example, the county is interested in preventing large tax shifts that may
otherwise be incurred by county residents each year the centrally assessed wind
energy project is depreciated; therefore, cooperation to establish an agreement
for payment in lieu of taxes (PILT), or other acceptable solutions may be
necessary. A development agreement or substitute agreement may be required as a
condition of the permit, and must be approved by the board of county
commissioners prior to commencing construction.
   D.   Conditional Use Permit: Following the provisions of chapter 18 of this
title, additional or more thorough consideration shall be given to the
following as the county determines whether the project needs to be approved,
denied, or conditionally approved:
      1.   Project Rationale: Project rationale, including estimated
construction schedule, project life, phasing, and likely buyers or markets for
the generated energy.
      2.   Siting Considerations: Siting considerations, such as avoiding
areas/locations with a high potential for biological conflict such as
wilderness study areas, areas of critical environmental concern, county and
state parks, historic trails, special management areas or important wildlife
habitat; avoiding visual corridors that are designated by the county after
analyzing the applicant's wind energy system proposal and considering public
hearing comments; avoiding areas of erodible slopes and soils, where concerns
for water quality, landslide, severe erosion, or high stormwater runoff
potential have been identified; and, avoiding known sensitive historical,
cultural or archeological resources.
      3.   Site And Development Plans: Site and development plans, which locate
and describe the project boundaries, all existing and proposed structures,
setbacks, access routes, proposed road improvements, existing inhabitable
structures and residentially zoned lots within 1.25 miles of the project,
existing utilities/pipelines/transmission lines, proposed utility lines/
structures, existing topography, existing and proposed drainageways, proposed
grading, natural vegetation removal, revegetation actions, dust and erosion
control, any floodplains or wetlands, and other relevant items identified by
county staff or planning commission. All maps and visual representations need
to be drawn at an appropriate scale.
      4.   Analysis Of Local Economic Benefits: Analysis of local economic
benefits, describing estimated: project cost, generated property taxes and
local sales taxes, percent of construction dollars to be spent locally, and the
number of local construction and permanent jobs.
      5.   Visual Impacts, Appearance And Scenic View Sheds: Potential visual
impacts include, but are not limited to, wind towers, rotors, aboveground
electrical lines, accessory structures, access roads, utility trenches and
installations, and alteration of vegetation. The applicant must provide a view
shed analysis of the project, including visual simulations of the wind energy
systems and any significant planned structures or improvements, such as new
roads on a hillside or substations. The number of visual simulations shall be
sufficient to provide adequate analysis of the visual impacts of the proposal,
which shall be from no less than four (4) vantage points that together provide
a view from all sides of the project. More visually sensitive proposals may
require analysis from significantly more vantage points, such as different
distances and sensitive locations. The planning commission may also require a
zone of theoretical visibility/zone of visual impact (ZVI) analysis, which is a
three hundred sixty degree (360°) computer analysis to map the lands within a
defined radius of a location that would likely be able to see an object; in
this case the proposed wind energy system (or a portion thereof).
      6.   Wildlife Habitat Areas And Migration Patterns, Including Avian And
Bat Data For The Project Area: Specifically include information on any use of
the site by endangered or threatened species and whether the project is in a
biologically significant area. If threatened or endangered species exist,
consultation with USDFW will be necessary. A plan for ongoing monitoring after
the project is operational for bird, bat, or other wildlife impacts may be
required.
      7.   Environmental Analysis: The applicant shall meet all state and
federal guidelines, laws, and regulations.
      8.   Solid Waste Or Hazardous Waste: The application must include plans
for the spill prevention, cleanup, and disposal of fuels, oils, and hazardous
wastes, as well as collection methods for solid waste disposal. Verification
that all construction waste generated from the project has been removed from
the area will be required before a certificate of occupancy may be issued.
      9.   Height Restrictions And FAA Hazard Review: Compliance with any
applicable airport overlay zoning requirements and the ability to comply with
FAA regulations pertaining to hazards to air navigation must be demonstrated.
      10.   Transportation Plan, For Construction And Operation Phases:
Indicate by description and map what roads the project will utilize during the
construction and operation/maintenance phases of the project, along with their
existing surfacing and condition. Specify any new roads and proposed upgrades
or improvements needed to the existing road system to serve the project (both
the construction and O&M periods); remember to identify needed bridges,
culverts, livestock fence crossings (gates and cattleguards), etc. Also
identify all areas where modification of the topography is anticipated
(cutting/filling) to construct or improve the roadways. Address road
restoration or maintenance needs associated with the construction, ongoing
maintenance/repair, and potential dismantling of the project. Provide projected
traffic counts for the construction period, broken down by the general type/
size of vehicles, and identify approximately how many trips will have oversized
or overweight loads. The county may require financial guarantees to ensure
proper repair/restoration of roadways or other infrastructure damaged or
degraded during construction or dismantling of the project. To provide a proper
reference for restoration, the "before" conditions of the roadways and other
infrastructure must be documented through appropriate methods such as videos,
photos, and written records.
      11.   Public Safety: Identify and address any known or suspected
potential hazards to adjacent properties, public roadways, communities,
aviation, radar systems, etc., that may be created by the project.
      12.   Noise Limitations: Submit sufficient information regarding noise,
so as to demonstrate compliance with subsection B5 of this section.
      13.   Shadow Flicker: Identify the potential of any shadow flicker
effects from the project and provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate
compliance with subsection B7e of this section.
      14.   Telecommunications Interference: Demonstrate that the potential for
adverse electromagnetic fields and communications interference generated by the
project has been evaluated and determined unlikely; conduct a licensed
microwave search and worst case fresnel zone (WCFZ) analysis, including
consultations with the national telecommunications information administration
(NTIA), interdepartmental radio advisory committee (IRAC) and the national
weather service.
      15.   Agreement/Easement For Life Of The Project And Final Reclamation:
If the land on which the project is proposed is to be leased, rather than
owned, by the wind development company, all property within the project
boundary must be included in a recorded easement(s), lease(s), or consent
agreement(s) specifying the applicable uses for the duration of the project.
Also describe the decommissioning and final land reclamation plan to be
followed after the anticipated useful life, or abandonment, or termination of
the project, including evidence of an agreement or other commitment (i.e., bond
and/or sinking fund) with affected parties (county, any lessor or property
owner, etc.) that ensures proper final reclamation of the wind energy project,
as well as repairing any road impacts associated with the work. All required
leases, easements, bonds, or other agreements between the wind development
company and the affected parties must be in place prior to commencing
construction, unless specified otherwise by the conditional use permit.

10-27-5: LANDSCAPE AND IRRIGATION DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL NEW AND
REHABILITATION DEVELOPMENT IN ANY ZONE:
   A.   Plant Selection: Plants shall be well-suited to the microclimate and
soil conditions at the project site. Native, locally adaptable and
environmentally sustainable plants are acceptable. See the Washington County
Water Conservancy District's recommended plant list on wcwcd.org. Plants with
similar water needs shall be grouped together as much as possible into
hydrozones for efficient irrigation. Invasive plant species as identified by
the county shall not be planted.
      1.   Areas with slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%) shall be
landscaped with deep-rooting, water- conserving plants that do not include
grass.
      2.   Park strips and other landscaped areas less than eight (8) feet wide
shall be landscaped with water-conserving plants and/or mulch that do not
include grass. All Planting Beds must have mulch on the soil surface with
exceptions for areas being restored to appear as a native desert.
      3.   All Planting Beds shall have mulch on the soil surface with
exceptions for areas being restored to appear as a native desert.
   B.   Tree Selection and Irrigation: Tree species shall be selected based on
growth characteristics and site conditions, including available space, overhead
clearance, soil conditions, exposure, and desired color and appearance. Trees
shall be suited for water-efficient landscapes. Trees shall be irrigated on a
separate hydrozone as needed for efficient irrigation, and to allow for
watering under water-shortage conditions when other plant material may not be
watered due to drought conditions. Trees shall be selected and planted in
accordance with the following county guidance:
      1.   Broad canopy trees shall be selected where shade or screening of
tall objects is desired;
      2.   Low-growing trees shall be selected for spaces under utility wires;
      3.   Select trees from which lower branches will be trimmed to maintain a
healthy growth habit where visual clearance and natural surveillance is a
concern;
      4.   Narrow or columnar trees shall be selected for small spaces, or
where awnings or other building features limit growth, or where greater
visibility is desired between buildings and the street for natural
surveillance; and
      5.   Tree placement shall provide canopy cover (shade) and avoid
conflicts with existing trees, retaining walls, above and below ground
utilities, lighting, and other obstructions.
   C.   Maintenance: All areas required to be landscaped shall be maintained in
a live and thriving condition. Such areas shall be mowed, trimmed, fertilized,
and edged, and free from dead plants, weeds, litter or debris, in compliance
with regionally accepted horticultural practices.
   D.   Irrigation Design Standards:
      1.   Pressure Regulation. A pressure regulating valve shall be installed
by the builder or developer, and maintained by the owner, if the static service
pressure exceeds ninety (90) pounds per square inch (psi). The pressure-
regulating valve shall be located between the meter and the first point of
water use, or first point of division in the pipe, and shall be set at the
manufacturer's recommended pressure for the sprinklers.
      2.    Irrigation Controller. It is required that landscaped areas use a
WaterSense labeled smart irrigation controller, or a similar weather-based
controller if an appropriate WaterSense model is not available, which
automatically adjusts the frequency and/or duration of irrigation events in
response to changing weather conditions. All controllers shall be equipped with
automatic rain delay or rain shut-off capabilities and have memory retention
capability to retain pre-programmed irrigation schedules. Sites are not exempt
from water waste prohibitions.
      3.   Where lawns are allowed, spray irrigation may be used. To the extent
possible, spray irrigation should be free from obstructions.
      4.   Each valve shall irrigate a landscape with a similar site, slope and
soil conditions, and plant materials with similar watering needs. Grass, trees
and non-grass areas shall be irrigated on separate valves. Drip emitters and
sprinklers shall be placed on separate valves.
      5.   Low-volume irrigation equipment (i.e., drip emitters, bubblers)
shall be provided for each tree.
      6.   Drip irrigation shall be used to irrigate plants in non-grass areas.
Drip system shall be equipped with a pressure regulator filter, flush-end
assembly and emitters rated for twenty (20) gallons per hour (gph) or less.
Spray head to drip conversion for rehabilitated landscape sites may be
acceptable with county approval of Irrigation Plans.
      7.   High conservation efficiency spray nozzles are required for
sprinkler applications.
      8.   Sprinkler heads shall have matched precipitation rates with each
control valve circuit.
      9.   Sprinkler heads shall be attached to rigid lateral lines with
flexible material (swing joints) to reduce potential for breakage.
      10.   Check valves are required. Pressure compensating valves and
sprinklers are required where a significant variation in water pressure occurs
within the irrigation system due to elevation differences.
      11.   Filters and end-flush valves shall be provided for drip irrigation
lines if pumped or secondary irrigation water is utilized.
      12.   Landscape watering with potable (treated) water is prohibited from
ten o’clock (10:00) a.m. to eight o’clock (8:00) p.m., from June 1 to September
1, to maximize irrigation efficiency.
      13.   Water waste is prohibited. Waste includes overwatering, irrigating
during a precipitation event, water that sprays or flows off the property,
failure to comply with drought restrictions and/or a failure to repair
irrigation system leaks and/or malfunctions in a timely manner.
      Overwatering can be avoided by following the water district's recommended
irrigation schedule and practices as noted on wcwcd.org. The generally
recommended schedule is:
         a.   Winter (Nov - Feb) - sprinkler and drip irrigation up to one (1)
day a week. Irrigation is typically not needed in December, January and
February
         b.   Spring (Mar - April) - sprinkler irrigation up to three (3) days
a week and drip irrigation up to two (2) days a week
         c.   Summer (May - Aug) - sprinkler irrigation up to four (4) days a
week and drip irrigation up to three (3) days a week
         d.   Fall (Sept - Oct) - sprinkler irrigation up to three (3) days a
week and drip irrigation up to two (2) days a week
      14.   Program valves for multiple repeat cycles are required to reduce
runoff on slopes and for soils with slow infiltration rates.
   15.   Backflow prevention devices that are permanently affixed are required
to prevent backflow of chemicals or other contaminants from entering the
potable water system, or other water sources in the area. Fertigation systems
are not permitted without backflow prevention devices that are permanently
affixed. (Ord. 2022-1206-O, 4-19-2022; amd. Ord. 2023-1246-O, 12-19-2023; Ord.

CHAPTER 28
TEMPORARY HOUSING ACCOMMODATION PILOT PROGRAM
SECTION:
10-28-1: Temporary Housing Accommodation Pilot Program
10-28-1: TEMPORARY HOUSING ACCOMMODATION PILOT PROGRAM:
   A.   The purpose of this section is to create a pilot program to provide a
temporary housing accommodation during the current housing crisis. The County
may terminate this program at any time, but it shall automatically sunset
without further action on May 15, 2028. A Recreational Vehicle (RV) or Tiny
House on Wheels (THOW) as defined in Section
10-4-1  may be used as a temporary housing accommodation on a lot or parcel in
a zone that allows single-family dwellings as a permitted use, subject to
meeting all following requirements:
      1.   A temporary use permit must be approved prior to occupancy.
         a.   The temporary use permit must be renewed yearly or it is deemed
expired.
         b.   A temporary use permit may only be renewed twice, for a total
limit of three years for any temporary housing accommodation.
      2.   The primary dwelling on the lot or parcel must be owner occupied.
For purposes of this section, an "owner-occupant" shall have a primary
residential exemption on the lot or parcel as determined by the Washington
County Assessor's office, and shall be a permanent, full time resident at the
same address.
      3.   The use of a RV or THOW as a STR is prohibited.
      4.   The use of a RV or THOW for more than three (3) people is
prohibited.
      5.   The utilities for the RV or THOW must be installed to state and
health department standards.
         a.   The utilities must be run to a pedestal or the primary dwelling
for a plug-in. Other options may be approved by the Building Official.
         b.   A functioning interior bathroom is required. Composting toilets
or other alternative systems are not permitted. It is unlawful to empty any
receptacle or fixture containing human excreta, human urine, or any other waste
from a RV or THOW except into an approved waste system.
      6.   No structure can be connected to the RV or THOW such as an artic
entrance, accessory building or skirting. A deck may be constructed immediately
adjacent to the RV or THOW and connected to the ground. The deck may be
minimally attached to the to the RV or THOW, so it easily can be removed to
maintain the mobility of the RV or THOW.
      7.   RV must be roadworthy. The RV must have current registration, and be
in a drivable, towable condition at all times.
      8.   Use of a generator is not permitted.
      9.   The temporary housing accommodation must be secondary in nature to
the primary dwelling and for the purpose of temporarily accommodating only
family members of the lot or parcel owner. The use of an RV or THOW as a
temporary housing accommodation does not create a permitted structure,
dwelling, or accessory dwelling unit (ADU). For the purpose of the temporary
housing accommodation chapter only, the definition of "family" is as follows:
Immediate family members of the property owner or spouse of the property owner,
limited to a child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, sibling, sister-in-law,
brother-in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. The definition of "family" in
County Ord. §
10-4-1  does not apply to a temporary housing accommodation.
      10.   A RV or THOW may be used as a temporary housing accommodation for
the lot or parcel owner if there is an active building permit for construction
of a primary dwelling, and if construction is in process.
      11.   A RV or THOW approved as a temporary housing accommodation shall
not be kept in the building setback on the lot or parcel, or in the front yard,
street side yard or on the street. The RV or THOW must meet setbacks
established for ADU's.
      12.   One off street parking space is required to accommodate a vehicle
for the occupant of the RV or THOW.
      13.   No more than one RV or THOW may be used as temporary housing
accommodation per lot or parcel.
      14.   These provisions do not apply to an owner's unoccupied RV stored on
the lot or parcel.
   B.   Application and Permit Required: A property owner seeking the use of a
RV or THOW as a temporary housing accommodation must submit a complete
application and obtain a permit for the temporary use. The application and
permit must be renewed annually, subject to the time limits herein.
   C.   Information Required:
      1.   Fully completed temporary use application forms.
      2.   All applicable fees.
      3.   Proof of ownership and owner occupancy of the primary dwelling.
      4.   Site plan, drawn to scale showing existing and proposed buildings,
fences, general landscape layout, vehicle circulation, driveways, and the
location of the RV or THOW and its parking and required setbacks.
      5.   Current RV registration.
      6.   Utility plan and hook-up locations.
      7.   Septic permit.
      8.   Photos of RV or THOW.
   D.   The complete temporary use permit application must be submitted to the
Community Development Department for review and processing. The review and
approval of a temporary use permit is an administrative decision handled at the
staff level and does not require JUD or Planning Commission approval.
   E.   Any issued temporary use permit may be revoked or denied by the County
because of:
      1.   The failure of the applicant to comply with conditions and
requirements of this chapter or any other county ordinance;
      2.   Failure to provide and properly attach to approved utilities via a
pedestal or the primary dwelling;
      3.   Eviction of the tenants or occupants of the RV or THOW;
      4.   Unlawful activities conducted or permitted upon the premises;
      5.   The temporary housing accommodation is obtained by deception or is
issued to or obtained by an unauthorized person, or
      6.   The site, yard, or unit conditions create a nuisance.
   F.   The permitting of temporary housing accommodation, or any Hearing, or
Appeal on Revocation or Denial, shall be processed as outlined in Washington
County Code Title 10, Chapter 2. (Ord. 2022-1210-O, 6-21-2022; amd. Ord., 2-18-
2025)

10-29-4: GENERAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Neighborhood Commercial Standards: Neighborhood Commercial is a zoning
designation unique to Pine Valley and regulates all commercial development
within the Pine Valley Overlay Zone. All commercial zoning shall be
Neighborhood Commercial, rural or historical in character and shall be in
harmony with the surrounding development. Neighborhood Commercial development
should be oriented to the community and the needs of the community. It shall
provide areas where low impact commercial and service uses can be harmoniously
integrated with rural and residential uses at a village scale. It shall have a
lesser impact than normally associated with commercial development and shall be
lower in density to preserve a feeling of open space and preservation of public
views compatible with the area’s natural and scenic beauty. Buildings shall be
limited to a maximum size of 5,000 square feet and must be single story. The
creation of additional commercially zoned property is strongly discouraged. Any
zoning amendment to change the zoning to a Neighborhood Commercial zoning or
use will require a community meeting noticed per section
10-2-3 of the Washington County Code prior to the application submittal to
Washington County and be required to be Neighborhood Commercial with a minimum
lot size of one (1) acre. Zoning requests to Neighborhood Commercial will need
to meet the following standards:
      It meets a fundamental need of the community.
      It provides an essential service for the community.
      It promotes safety for the residents, including among other things, the
lessening of congestion in the streets and road, securing safety from fire and
other dangers.
      Single story in height.
      All future commercial uses shall be community focused. Tourist uses shall
be ancillary to the community Neighborhood Commercial uses.
      Neighborhood Commercial uses are as follows:
         Country store
         Financial services
         Medical, or professional office
         Office, professional
         Personal care service
         Personal instruction
         Religious facility
         Restaurant, rural or historic architectural style
   B.   Residential Standards: In order to preserve the rural nature and feel
of Pine Valley, any new subdivided lots created for development shall be a
minimum of 1 acre in size. To maintain the rural nature and feel of Pine Valley
and to provide for appropriately sized homes on lots, lot coverage standards
are included in the overlay zone.
   The combined square footage of all detached accessory structures, with the
exception of barns, shall not exceed 15% of the total lot area if the structure
is entirely within the setbacks for the principal structure, or 10% of the
total area if the structure is located elsewhere on the lot. Barns except in
Agricultural districts may have a lot coverage up to 25% so long as the use is
incidental to the primary residential use. In Agricultural districts where
agricultural uses are operating, barns are permitted without a primary
residential use.
   Fractional home ownership is not permitted within the Pine Valley Overlay
Zone.

15-3. Sight obscuring fencing is allowed within a building setback and yard for
privacy but may not be used along the perimeter of the parcel.
         b.   Landscaping: In order to preserve the rural nature of Pine
Valley, it is recommended that landscaping incorporates local Utah native
plants. Due to the proximity of the Dixie National Forest, plants listed from
the website plant database are encouraged. https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/dixie/
learning/
         Borrow ditches are to be maintained with natural materials and remain
open.
         It is encouraged to create a defensible space around residential
buildings by keeping twigs, leaves, shrubs, dead grasses and brush away from
the perimeter of the structures.
         Washington County Community Fire Planning recognizes that many
communities are at risk for wildland fires and provides the following link to
reduce the risk around your home.

Firewise-USA
      3.   Signs: Signs should be in harmony with the rural character of Pine
Valley and are subject to Title 10 Section 19, unless otherwise stated in this
overlay zone.
      Commercial signs are only permitted on parcels that the commercial use is
located. Off premise signs are prohibited. Pole signs are not permitted within
the Pine Valley Overlay Zone. One monument or low-profile sign per commercial
lot is allowed with the following standards:
         a.   Shall be limited to a maximum of six (6) feet in height from
finished grade.

         c.   Shall be limited to only one sign per business constructed in
lieu of, and not in addition to, any freestanding sign.
         d.   Shall contain no animation or lighting, except for one spotlight
directed at the face of the sign, not into the air, into the face of oncoming
traffic or onto adjacent property. A double faced sign may be lighted in this
manner from both sides or from indirect lighting located inside the sign in
lieu of spotlights.
         e.   Shall contain no animation, video, reader boards, sound, odor,
flashing message lighting, or components of any kind that move, shimmer,

         f.   Wall signs are allowed per Section
10-19-3-B.8.
      4.   Outdoor Lighting and Glare:
      Purpose: It is the intent of this Subsection to establish lighting
practices and systems to minimize light pollution, glare, and light trespass;
conserve energy and resources while maintaining nighttime safety, utility, and
security; and curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment.
      It is recognized that the rural nature of Pine Valley is unique and
valuable to the community. The enjoyment of a starry night is an experience the
community desires to preserve. The Pine Valley Overlay Zone promotes the
reduction of light pollution that interferes with enjoyment of the night sky.
      If public lighting fixtures are required for safety, rural or historical
style fixtures shall be used.
      The functional objectives in providing outdoor lighting are to illuminate
areas necessary for safe, comfortable, and energy efficient use. Outdoor
lighting shall be shielded and limited to provide for safe ingress and egress.
      The following standards shall apply to new lighting:
         a.   Shielding: All non-exempt outdoor lighting shall be fully
shielded.
         b.   Building canopy, soffit, and wall mounted lighting: Lighting
fixtures mounted on a canopy or soffit shall be recessed so that the lighting
is flush with the bottom surface and fully shielded by the fixture or the edge
of the canopy or soffit. Wall-mounted fixtures shall not be mounted above
eighteen (18) feet as measured from the top of the fixture to the adjacent
grade or horizontal plane being lit by the fixture.
         c.   Construction Lighting: All commercial construction sites shall
shield lighting to minimize glare on adjacent parcels.
         d.   Pathway Lighting: The intent of pathway lighting is to provide
pools of light to help direct pedestrians along the path, not to fully
illuminate the path. Pathway intersections should be illuminated for safety.
Pathway lighting and public trails, when required, shall not be mounted more
than ten (10) feet above finished grade. Residential pathways must be shielded
to minimize the glare on adjacent properties.
         e.   Seasonal Lighting: Winter seasonal lights that do not cause light
trespass or interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of property are
permitted from the first of November to the first of February. Seasonal lights
are exempt from the fully shielded requirement and any color of lights may be
used; however, seasonal lights shall not be used to create advertising messages
or signs. Digital displays are prohibited. Spelling out the name of a business
with seasonal lights is prohibited.
            (1)   Residential seasonal lights shall comply with zone-required
setbacks and be turned off by midnight. Flashing, blinking, intermittent
lights, or other lights that move or give the impression of movement are
prohibited except during holidays, including permanent year-round programmable
lighting.
            (2)   Commercial seasonal lights shall be turned off by midnight.
            (3)   Exceptions:
               (A)   String lights are exempt from the fully shielded
requirement and may be used year-round to illuminate decks, porches, patios,
gazebos, and pergolas, but are prohibited from wrapping the entire roofline of
the house and illuminating landscaping or outlining structures.
         f.   Lighting that is discouraged:
            (1)   Architectural lighting
            (2)   Landscaping lighting
         g.   Prohibited Lighting: Unless otherwise exempted, the following are
prohibited:
            (1)   Up-lighting
            (2)   Unshielded floodlights
            (3)   Unshielded spotlights
            (4)   Search lighting, laser source lights, or high intensity
lighting except by police and fire personnel or at their discretion.
            (5)   Flashing, blinking, intermittent, or other lights that move
or give the impression of movement, except for seasonal lighting; this includes
permanent year-round programmable lighting.
            (6)   Neon or luminous tube lighting
            (7)   Lighting fixtures affixed to commercial buildings for the
purpose of lighting parking areas or sales display lot areas. Fully shielded
fixtures may be attached to building to light walkways and parking spaces
adjacent to buildings.
         h.   Light Trespass: Light trespass is artificial light that falls
beyond the legal boundaries of the property it is intended to illuminate.
Outdoor lighting shall be aimed and fully shielded so that the direct
illumination shall be confined to the property boundaries of the source.
         i.   Exemptions: The following are exempt from this Subsection:
            (1)   Gas Lights: All outdoor light fixtures producing light
directly by the combustion of natural gas or other fossil fuels are exempt from
the requirements of this Code.
            (2)   Up-lighting: Up-lighting is permitted in limited
circumstances: for government funded or owned statues, public monuments,
ground-mounted public art, or flags of the United States of America.
               (A)   All up-lighting shall be shielded and/or have beam-angle
control and shall be aimed to limit the directed light to the illuminated
object only.
               (B)   Up-lighting is permitted thirty (30) minutes before sunset
and until 11:00 p.m.; or, one hour after the close of location based on normal
hours of operations, whichever is later.
            (3)   Temporary lighting for outdoor filming and outdoor
performance venues.
            (4)   Underwater lighting in swimming pools, hot tubs, and other
water features.
            (5)   Traffic control signals and devices.
            (6)   Streetlights: See rural street section.
         j.   Fire Protection: Due to the proximity of the National Forest land
that surrounds the community, fire protection is a high priority for the Pine
Valley Overlay Zone.
            (1)   Fire Hydrants: The Pine Valley Fire Department is responsible
for fire hydrants. Newly developed area will require additional fire hydrants
that meet Washington County Standards. Additional hydrants in already developed
areas will be located as necessary. The Washington County Code is responsible
for fire hydrant locations and will determine acceptable distance of hydrant
from home.
            (2)   Fire Pits: Pine Valley Overlay Zone is a high risk area for
fire. Small recreational fire pits are allowed in residential zones and shall
be allowed per the adopted Wildland Urban Interface Code. Permanently installed
firepits are recommended for increased fire safety. It is recommended that
firepits be located at least fifteen (15) feet away from any structure, plants,
trees or anything flammable. Burning is limited to dry, clean, natural
materials. No garbage, plastics, rubber, oils, or construction waste.
            (3)   Defensible Space: It is encouraged to create a defensible
space around residential buildings by keeping twigs, leaves, shrubs, dead
grasses and brushes away from the perimeter of the structures. Trim trees and
remove branches away from any structure.
         k.   Meadow Protection: Preserving the meadows in Pine Valley has been
a long-term goal. Working with the Virgin River Land Preservation Association,
Pine Valley property owners have protected 100 acres of historic meadowlands
(as of March 2022), using conservation easements that allow them to either sell
or donate their development rights. These easements protect agricultural uses
and minimize development; they are crafted individually with each landowner.
         Future policy should accommodate this voluntary effort between the
individual landowners and the land trust.
         It is recommended that no development take place in the meadows beyond
a depth of one (1) block north of the main east-west road through the
community.
         To further the meadow protection, seeking out financial opportunities
is encouraged through local, state, or federal grants.
         l.   Dumping or Disposal: Dumping or disposal of construction
materials or other materials shall be subject to Section
10-13-20 of the Washington County Code and is prohibited in any public right-
of-way.
         m.   Cell Towers: To preserve the rural nature of Pine Valley, co-
location of wireless communication antennas is encouraged to minimize the
number of tower structures. A conditional use permit will be required for all
wireless facilities. Facilities located on buildings is encouraged. Wireless
communication facilities with lattice are prohibited. All wireless facilities
shall be fully enclosed. Equipment required to support the wireless
communication facility shall be fully enclosed. Height shall be limited to no
more than ten (10) feet higher than the permitted height for structures in the
zoning district it is located within.
         Alternative tower structures / stealth facilities are also encouraged
to camouflage or conceal a wireless communications tower. Alternative tower
structures may be designed to appear as trees, chimneys on a structure, or
similar projections that blend in with the rural nature of the community.

CHAPTER 30
SCENIC BYWAY OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
10-30-1: Purpose
10-30-2: Area Defined
10-30-3: Zoning Districts Within The Scenic Byway Overlay Zone
10-30-4: General Standards And Requirements
10-30-5: Definitions
10-30-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of these regulations is to enhance the economic viability of the
Scenic Byway Overlay Zone ("SBOZ") through preserving and enhancing the natural
environment and enhancing aesthetic protections for development in the zone.
The Zion Park Scenic Byway SR-9 is an iconic entrance to Zion National Park
where the natural Virgin River shoreland, and the corridor, cliffs, and canyons
carved by eons of river erosion, interfaces with development. (Ord. 2023-1245-
O, 12-19-2023)
10-30-2: AREA DEFINED:
A designated scenic byway is a roadway in Washington County, Utah that has a
National or State designation as a scenic byway. The Zion Scenic Byway SR-9 is
the only currently designated national or state scenic byway in Washington
County where substantial portions of the roadway are outside of the designated
area of a National Park, and it is the area subject to these overlay
regulations. The section of the designated Zion Scenic Byway that is the
subject of this chapter begins in La Verkin at the intersection of SR-17 and
SR-9 and continues to the south entrance of Zion National Park. The affected
area located in Washington County is shown on Map 1: Scenic Byway Overlay Zone:
below. Designated scenic byways enhance the natural, archeological, historic,
cultural, recreational, and scenic qualities of the areas through which they
pass. They enhance the experience of residents, travelers, and tourists. They
are an engine of economic vitality if limited and reasonable standards preserve
and protect views to enhance the visitor and resident experience along the
scenic corridor. Any lot or parcel along, accessed by, or viewed from the
designated Zion Scenic Byway, or within the Scenic Byway Overlay Zone, as
depicted on the overlay zone map that is in Washington County, and outside of
the designated area of a National Park, is subject to these standards. In
addition to these standards, other existing county regulations and standards
applicable to the property, or in the underlying zone for the property, also
apply. In the event of a conflict between other regulations or standards, the
provisions of this overlay zone shall govern. In the event of a dispute
pertaining to the boundary or location of a property within the SBOZ, the
Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the Washington County
Commission. The County Commission is the final authority to interpret and
render a written determination of the applicable boundary of such category or
district.

(Ord. 2023-1245-O, 12-19-2023)
10-30-3: ZONING DISTRICTS WITHIN THE SCENIC BYWAY OVERLAY ZONE:
Only certain zoning districts listed below are permitted in the SBOZ. Current
uses and zoning designations that are not permitted in the SBOZ, are now
existing, nonconforming. Any newly proposed commercial, mixed use, or multiple
lot or planned development residential, projects will be required to seek and
obtain a zone change to PD-SBOZ (Planned Development Scenic Byway Overlay Zone)
before development. Standard commercial development is more appropriate in C-1,
C-2, or C-3 zones and should be located close to freeway interchanges and at
the intersections of important transportation routes or clustered in existing
communities and not along the Zion Park Scenic Byway. To meet the demand and
possible need for commercial development within the SBOZ, all such proposed
development shall require a zone change to the PD-SBOZ. If any other zoning and
uses are no longer permitted in the zone, like manufacturing or industrial,
current zoning or their uses are now existing, nonconforming. If an existing,
nonconforming lot or parcel had the right to construct a single family dwelling
or accessory structures under prior ordinances, the right continues. Any use of
land that is not plainly designated as a permitted use in the zone is
prohibited.
   A.   A-20 (Agricultural Twenty (20) Acre Minimum Lot Size Zone): The purpose
of this zone is to preserve appropriate areas for agricultural uses in the
SBOZ. Permitted and conditional uses for this district are found in Titles 10-
7-2 and 10-7-3.
   B.   OSC-20 (Open Space Conservation Twenty (20) Acre Minimum Lot Size
Zone): The purpose of this zone is to allow for the preservation of the scenic
natural undeveloped land in the SBOZ. No development is allowed within this
zoning district except permitted uses found in Title 10-6A-2. The conditional
uses described in 10-6A-3 are permitted in the SBOZ except outdoor shooting
range/tactical training facility.
   C.   OST-20 (Open Space Transition Twenty (20) Acre Minimum Lot Size Zone):
The purpose of this zone is to provide for the protection of primarily
undeveloped private land in the SBOZ. Permitted and conditional uses for this
district are described in 10-6B-2. The conditional uses described in 10-6B-
3 are permitted in the Scenic Byway Overlay Zone except airports, golf course
and outdoor shooting range/tactical training facility.
   D.   PD-SBOZ: Uses Permitted In The PD-SBOZ: The overall purpose of the PD-
SBOZ (Scenic Byway Overlay Zone) is to allow and encourage applicant
flexibility and creativity in design and development of comprehensively planned
projects in the PD-SBOZ. The specific purposes and intent of the planned
development zoning regulations are:
      1.   To provide greater compatibility with surrounding land uses
consistent with the Washington County General Plan.
      2.   To allow for a more efficient and creative site design for a
specific property.
      3.   To encourage property owners to develop master plans of their total
land while still allowing for phased development.
      4.   All planned developments in the PD-SBOZ shall conform to all
requirements herein, and to all requirements in
10-9-1 through
10-9-8 for planned developments. Density also shall conform to the density
limits in the General Standards and Requirements, and under Roadway Design
herein. If there is a conflict, the requirements herein control over the
requirements in Title 10 chapter 9.
      5.   The uses for the PD-SBOZ are listed below in the Use Chart. Uses
indicated by the letter “P” are permitted; uses indicated by the letter “PS”
are permitted with required standards; and uses indicated by the letter “C” are
conditional. Uses not specifically identified are not permitted in the PD-SBOZ.

1292-O, 5-6-2025)
10-30-4: GENERAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Access and Visibility: All development visible from the Zion Scenic
Byway or in the SBOZ shall maintain and enhance the scenic views along it.
   B.   Setback from the Virgin River: Setbacks from the edge of the Virgin
River channel as defined by FEMA shall be a minimum of one hundred feet (100').
See Map 2: Flood Plain: below. Development along the Virgin River shall meet
the requirements and standards set forth in Title 12 Chapter 5: Provisions for
Flood Hazard Reduction.
   C.   Distance and Setback Requirements: All buildings or structures shall be
setback a minimum of one hundred feet (100') from the Zion Scenic Byway. All
surface parking areas shall be setback a minimum of fifty feet (50') from the
Zion Scenic Byway. All buildings, structures, or surface parking areas shall be
screened from the Zion Scenic Byway with designed and irrigated landscape
screening and berms including tree plantings a maximum of thirty feet (30')
apart, with some clustering permitted in county’s sole discretion.
   D.   Grading: Natural slopes on the lot or parcel exceeding ten percent
(10%) grade shall not be cut or used to cut and fill other areas for the
development. Significant removal of soil material on the uphill side, and
filling on the downhill side, when natural slope conditions exceed ten percent
(10%) to create a large, flat development pad is not permitted. All development
shall conform to the existing contours of the land.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4584.jpg]
   E.   Architecture and Design: All buildings, dwellings, or structures in the
SBOZ shall be approved as part of the planned development, or at the time of
obtaining a building permit. All buildings, dwellings, or structures shall
enhance the visual environment of the SBOZ by blending harmoniously into the
natural environment. Mass and bulk shall be minimized through articulations, a
variety of vertical and horizontal planes, rooflines, windows, reveals,
alcoves, corners and architectural interest. Because the aesthetic features in
the SBOZ design and color selection is important and shall be limited as set
forth herein. Parkitecture and desert modern architecture (see definitions in
10-30-5) are appropriate architectural styles for the SBOZ. The architecture
and design of structures shall be authentic for its place in time and location.
The light house in Cedar City is an example of an inappropriate, not authentic
structure for the context of its location. The height limit of any building,
dwelling, or structure is twenty-eight feet (28'). Height variation between
one- and two-story sections of any building, dwelling, or structure is required
creating a tier effect. No box or modified box structures are permitted.
Natural or natural appearing materials shall be used. Rusted or non-reflective
metal are permitted. Colors shall conform to the surrounding earth tones, such
as: clay, stone, golden burnt umber, sandstone, beige, off white, natural gray,
sage, or olive green. Finishes shall be matte and complement the natural
environment. High contrast coloration is prohibited. All buildings or
structures shall blend into the natural environment without excessive,
unamended grading or visual scarring. In the SBOZ, the visual impact of any
development shall be minimized. Due to the goals of the SBOZ, all buildings,
dwellings, or structures in all zones in the SBOZ shall comply with the
architecture and design requirements herein.
   F.   Density: Maximum density for any PD-SBOZ commercial, mixed use, or
multiple lot or planned development residential, project is one unit per three
acres. If the project includes hotel, transient room, short term rental, or
other nightly rental uses, all units shall comply with County Ord. 10-9-7(B)
(4).
   G.   Roadway Design: Roadway design can be one of the most visually
disruptive portions of development in the SBOZ. These standards preserve public
safety while minimizing the visual disruption of roadways for development along
the Zion Scenic Byway and in the SBOZ. Any development on a lot or parcel in
the SBOZ shall obtain access from a public roadway, or a private roadway
acceptable to the county. Private roadway access width is acceptable at twenty
feet (20') of improved road surface, or a combination of road surface and up to
two feet (2') of drivable shoulder to provide enough room for two (2) vehicles
to pass if approved as part of the SBOZ project plan. Roadways in the SBOZ may
have narrower improved road surface widths, low impact layouts following the
natural contours of the site, and low contrast coloration. The design of the
roadway network may involve some give and take in achieving layouts compatible
with topography and to avoid unnecessary cuts and fills. All surfaces shall be
sloped or crowned to evenly drain and prevent erosion. The primary road design
shall be “open” drainage with filter strips and swales, not curb and gutter. If
curbs are deemed necessary, the design should consist primarily of invisible
curbs set at the same level as the surface of the road. Grading shall use
swales to direct water onto adjacent vegetative areas where runoff will
infiltrate or sheet flow naturally. Minimum roadway width shall be based on the
SBOZ plan approvals, the International Fire Code, fire apparatus access and
turnaround, and the density and use of the lot or parcel. Density and use
determine roadway width, as follows:
      1.   Two (2) accesses for commercial development, or for hybrid
commercial and residential development, are required unless all of the
following factors exist on the developing property:
         a.   Helicopter access is provided for secondary access and emergency
access or evacuation;
         b.   Access is obtained via a bridge over the Virgin River, and
providing two (2) accesses would necessitate the construction of a second
bridge, and the construction of a second bridge would be impractical or
impossible due to the regulatory requirements of other governmental agencies;
         c.   Looped or two-way traffic is accommodated through the commercial
development that provides for in and out traffic on two (2) separate roadways
or widths of roadways, except for areas servicing the bridge over the Virgin
River and the connection to SR-9; and
         d.   The development has a minimum acreage of 1500 acres with a
density not to exceed 91 commercial transient rental units, and 19 single
family dwelling units with no accessory dwelling units and no transient rental
uses.
      2.   Roadway width for commercial, hybrid, or short-term rental
development may be reduced as part of the overall PD-SBOZ project plan approval
if all of the following factors exist on the developing property:
   In an effort to minimize impact of development along the Zion Scenic Byway
corridor, both existing, and to be constructed private lanes and private roads
for PD development may be the minimum size necessary to provide services. The
density for the combined residential or commercial uses in the PD (all phases
counted as one development) shall comply with traffic volumes determined by a
traffic engineering study acceptable to the county. The traffic study
conclusions shall be based on accurate and complete traffic volume measurements
year-around, and on every day of the week, free from data bias;
   If the PD use includes hotel, transient room, short term rental, or other
nightly rental uses, the project shall have 91 units or less, no lockouts, and
the total nightly occupancy for the project shall be less than three hundred
and fifty (350) people;
         a.   Traffic volume shall accommodate the development considering
number of lanes, width of lanes, traffic speed, proportion of heavy vehicles,
conflicting or opposing traffic, roadway alignment, and width and type of
shoulder or pull-out areas.
         b.   Impacts, infrastructure: Providing adequate public infrastructure
to the development is the responsibility of the developer. A traffic impact
study (TIS) is required unless otherwise approved by the county engineer or
designee. The TIS aids in determining the off-site impact mitigation of the
development. Where a development abuts a road, utilities, or drainage system,
the developer shall complete the portion of the improvements to the full length
of the property.
   H.   Visual Protection: All development shall blend with the unique visual
character of the natural environment, ensuring that it blends rather than
interrupts the natural contours and elevations of the landforms. Development
shall be sited and designed to retain the existing topography and minimize
grading activities to the maximum extent. Development shall be sited so it does
not create a silhouette against the ridgelines or sky. All cuts, fills, and
grading shall be amended and revegetated with site appropriate vegetation
approved in the project plan.

Figure 1: Proposal Remains Below the Hillside and Skyline
   GOOD: The site selection and design of this structure keep the roofline
below the hillside and skyline, allowing it to blend in with the backdrop
created by the hillside.

Map 3: View Shed
   I.   Key Viewing Areas: Key Viewing Areas are important roads, trails,
recreational sites, and other places offering the public scenic views of the
corridor and shall be protected in the SBOZ as important areas for visual
protection. Key Viewing Areas also provide travelers with areas to safely park
off of the National Scenic Byway and engage with the interpretive sites and
scenic beauty of the area. Key Viewing Areas, and the seven Zion Scenic Byway
Interpretive Sites identified on Map 4 below, include portions of public roads,
parks, trails, and other historic sites or other vantage points within the
designated National Scenic Byway and from which the public views Zion National
Park. Scenic area landscapes also are important areas for visual protections in
the SBOZ, including gathering points, rest areas, roads, and trails that
provide primary access to the area, parking lots, and associated recreation
areas. Identified Key Viewing Areas and landscapes include:

Map 4: Interpretive Site
   J.   Outdoor Lighting: (See 10-15B OUTDOOR LIGHTING).
   K.   Landscape Plan:
      1.   A landscape plan shall be required for all applicable development
projects in accordance with County development standards. The Community
Development Department is the land use authority for the approval of all
landscape plans. Modifications to landscape plans must be approved prior to
installation of any landscape improvements.
      2.   The landscape plan shall include the following information:
         a.   Site plan showing the location and identification of all
significant native vegetation.
         b.   Site plan showing the location, size in square feet, and
identification of all proposed irrigated landscape areas, hardscape areas,
xeriscape landscaping areas, and native vegetation areas. A summary table of
this information shall appear on the site plan.
         c.   Quantity and size of all proposed plantings.
         d.   Site plan showing the location of all proposed stormwater
detention and retention areas.
         e.   Irrigation plan, indicating the layout and details of the
irrigation system.
      3.   Standards: The landscape plan shall comply with the following Grass
Area Restrictions:
         a.   In the SBOZ where it is a single family, two family, or multi-
family development, the grass area within the irrigated landscaped area shall
not exceed the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) of the irrigated landscaped area
or two thousand (2,000) square feet.
         b.   In the SBOZ where it is a commercial or mixed use commercial and
residential development, the grass area within the irrigated landscaped area
shall not exceed the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) of the irrigated
landscaped area or two hundred and fifty (250) square feet.
         c.   Consult a landscape architect or local nursery for a list of
plants that satisfy these requirements, thrive in the area, and are available
to purchase. The Washington County Water Conservancy District has a list of
recommended plants.
         d.   The use of grass in narrow, small, or oddly shaped areas less
than eight feet wide, is prohibited.
         e.   The use of grass on slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) is
prohibited.
         f.   Grass shall be irrigated separately from other landscaped areas.
      4.   Environmental Considerations: The landscape plan shall demonstrate
that plants are placed in the optimum location for water conservation, soil
stabilization, and erosion control.
      5.   Landscape Watering Zones: Plants with similar water needs shall be
grouped together. Areas landscaped with high water use plants shall be
separated from those with low and very low water usage.
      6.   Critical Lands: Existing plants within critical land areas, as
defined shall be disturbed only at the County’s discretion. If slopes greater
than thirty percent (30%) are disturbed, the area shall be landscaped with deep
rooting, water conserving plants for erosion control and soil stabilization.
      7.   Required Plants: All landscapes shall use plants identified as being
“water wise” or “low water” plants. A list of plants that satisfy these
requirements, thrive in the area, is available from the Washington County Water
Conservancy District.
      8.   Plant Substitutions: Landscaping shall be installed consistent with
approved planting plans, but plant substitutions may be made provided that the
substituted plants are of a similar plant type (bush-for-bush, tree-for-tree,
etc.) and have a similar water need as the plant originally specified in the
approved landscape plan.
      9.   Soil Amendment/Preparation: Where appropriate, the use of organic
soil amendments or additives, such as aged compost, are encouraged.
      10.   Mulch: Mulch, landscape rock or chat shall be installed and
maintained at a minimum depth of three inches (3") to four inches (4"). Fiber
barriers and plastic sheeting that are not porous to air and water are
prohibited.
      11.   Water Features: Unless it is a natural lake, pond, or stream, all
water features such as fountains, ponds, reflecting pools, and other similar
water features are prohibited.
      12.   Preservation Of Existing Vegetation: To the extent possible,
significant native vegetation shall be maintained on property and protected
during construction. When allowed to be removed, based on an approved
development permit, the native vegetation shall be replaced with landscaping
similar in type. To ensure survivability, replacement plantings may be smaller
sized and slightly denser than the original. The County may grant exceptions if
it is found that replacement is impossible or would require excessive amounts
of water.
      13.   Parking Area Landscaping:
         a.   Internal landscape shall equal at least fifteen percent (15%) of
the total parking area.
         b.   The use of grass within a parking area is prohibited.
         c.   Landscape islands shall be a minimum of nine feet (9') in width
and shall be landscaped with plants no more than four feet (4') in height or
high canopy trees.
         d.   Internal landscape shall be located so that pedestrians are not
required to cross landscaped areas without pathways to reach building entrances
from parked cars. This should be achieved through proper orientation of islands
and spaces.
         e.   Bioretention systems or other sustainable natural drainage
systems which reduce the stormwater runoff created by the development and which
promote infiltration of the generated stormwater into the subsurface are
required. Such systems include stormwater planter strips, infiltration swales
or trenches, stormwater curb extensions, rain gardens, etc. Exceptions to any
standards within this section may be granted by the County to accommodate the
design of such systems.
         f.   Parking and landscaping shall meet the requirements of Title 10.
   L.   Washington County Transportation Master Plan; Outdoor Recreation Master
Plan; Trail System Plans (County Plans):
      1.   Pedestrian walkways, trails, or bike paths shall be provided within
a development that connects to the public walkways, trails, or bike paths in
the county’s active transportation plan to serve the needs generated by the
development.
      2.   If the development property is within three hundred feet (300') of a
planned public walkway, trail, or bike path on the County Plans, the developer
is responsible for constructing a connection to the planned public
infrastructure. The space dedicated in trails may be included in the
calculation of the open space, as otherwise provided in this title.
      3.   In the event a public walkway, trail, or bike path on the County
Plans is located on a development parcel, pursuant to the provisions of Utah
Code Annotated section 17-27a-507, the county may require as part of the
development approval that the proportional share of the public infrastructure
running through the development site be constructed and provided by the
developer as a condition of approval. The proportional share shall be dedicated
to the county or memorialized by a recorded public easement under terms
acceptable to the county. Public infrastructure design and construction shall
be consistent with design guidelines established by county and for the
community wide active transportation system development standards.
   Developments shall connect an internal trail system to community wide trail
systems where possible. The space dedicated in trails may be included in the
calculation of the open space, as otherwise provided in this title. (Ord. 2023-

               Also known as "National Park Service Rustic" is a style of 20th-century
               architecture developed by the United States National Park Service in its
               effort to create buildings that harmonize with natural environment.
               The CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) built many structures in this style.
               The style draws from craftsman, Swiss chalets and Adirondack architecture.
               It includes horizontal lines, sloped roofs to break up the mass and height,
PARKITECTURE:  natural materials, porches, and the blending of indoor spaces with the
               outdoor surroundings. Examples include Yosemite’s Ahwahnee Hotel, Old
               Faithful Inn, The Glacier Park Lodge, Timberline Lodge, Vista House at Mt.
               Spokane Stake Park, Paradise Inn and Crater Lake Lodge. Local examples
               include the Browse Guard station at the Sequoia in the Dixie National
               Forest, and the Zion National Park Lodge. (Ord. 2023-1245-O, 12-19-2023;

10-31-9: Definitions
10-31-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is to guide future development in a way that maintains the rural,
historical and agricultural characteristics of the New Harmony Valley area and
to preserve its agricultural lands, open spaces, and scenic vistas. New
development will be guided by standards herein to ensure harmonious use with
the community.
The New Harmony Valley area is the northern entrance to Washington County, one
of the most scenic and iconic areas in Utah and the United States. The NHVOZ
protects the iconic views along SR 144, and roadways in the New Harmony Valley
area, including the views of Pine Valley Mountains, Kolob Fingers, Zion
National Park, the scattered bucolic views of pastoral lands, or the
traditional character of the community. The same views are the economic force
that drives development, and they must be preserved to enhance compatible
development. Road corridors form the 'bones' of our communities, roadscapes are
a primary means by which visitors and neighbors experience our communities.
They are the outward expression of community identity and heritage. Ensuring
that scenic corridors endure is important not only for the identity and
heritage of Washington County and the New Harmony Valley area, but also its
economic vitality. Scenic settings attract tourists, residents and businesses
seeking to capitalize on this brand. The quality-of-life Washington County
residence and visitors experience is due in large part to stepping out each day
into vistas that feed the soul. In the past, communities seeking to protect
scenic resources have found it difficult to establish the needed criteria. One
purpose of this New Harmony Valley Overlay Zone is to quantify and record such
criteria for the area. Both the natural and 'built' environment significantly
contribute to the overall quality of a community. The criteria in this overlay
zone balances the rights of property owners and the demands of development to
proactively create refined standards and requirements to ensure that the New
Harmony Valley area maintains its character while growing and developing in the
future. (Ord. 2024-1273-O, 9-17-2024; amd. Ord., 2-18-2025)
10-31-2: AREA DEFINED:
The regulations for the New Harmony Valley Overlay Zone (NHVOZ) shall apply to
the bounded area depicted on the map herein. The town of New Harmony is
incorporated, as defined by Washington County zoning maps, and is exempt from
this chapter.

development, and services located at rural crossroads, along state highways,
community gateways and in convenient and strategic locations of the county to
meet community needs for both the residents and visitors to the area.
Development in the VC zone should reflect the rural, pioneer, and agricultural
heritage of "Small Town America" in the unincorporated communities throughout
Washington County. As the "Downtown" area, the VC zone should be clearly
identifiable from other zones in appearance and intensity of development. The
following uses described in 10-10B are permitted with standard in the NHVOZ VC
zone. See chart below.

2-18-2025; Ord. 2025-1292-O, 5-6-2025)
10-31-5: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
New development should not overwhelm the existing built and natural
environment. Small-town feel does not mean that new development cannot take
place. Nor does having an increase in population density mean that all is lost
for ensuring a small-town feel exists in the future. New development shall be
planned intelligently and positioned respectfully to fit into nature and the
community. All developments shall minimize the area disturbed by construction
activities at any given time, particularly cuts and fills associated with road
construction. Phased site grading and stabilization or revegetation shall be
part of the grading and project plan. Over-grading, or the significant removal
of soil material on the uphill side of a site and filling on the downhill side,
when natural slope conditions exceed ten percent (10%) of the site, is not
permitted. All development shall generally conform to the existing contours of
the land.
   A.   Sensitive Area Protection Critical Lands include the natural drainages
of Camp Creek, Taylor Creek, Kanarra Creek, Pinto Creek, Ash Creek and Ash
Creek Reservoir and riparian habitats ("critical lands"). Critical lands shall
be protected from development and permanently protected in their natural state
to preserve riparian habitat, maintain storm water functions, minimize flood
damage, and serve as a natural history focal point of New Harmony and character
defining features of the area. Development within sensitive area protection of
critical lands shall be clustered, so all structures, buildings, impervious
surfaces and other development on the lot or parcel minimize the impact to the
sensitive and critical areas. The Washington County Water Conservancy District
is exempt from these provisions.
   B.   Permanent structures shall be located outside critical lands with only
minor improvements allowed such as trails, recreation amenities, or temporary
structures.
   C.   Exceptions Allowing Development Within Critical Lands:
      1.   In the event a legally defined lot or parcel or its access consists
of critical lands, and there are not permissible locations to develop on the
lot or parcel, then the property owner shall locate development on the parcel
in a manner that clusters development, limits disturbance, and protects forty-
nine percent (49%) or more of the critical lands.
      2.   Road and driveway crossings shall bridge over all floodplains.
      3.   Development may occur in jurisdictional wetlands only if the
applicant obtains a permit for development from the U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers or other applicable governmental entity, which shall be delivered to
the county for review prior to final approval of a development.
   D.   Geologic Hazards; Adverse Construction Conditions: Development upon
lands containing high or very high geologic hazards, or adverse construction
conditions, as defined by the Utah Geologic Survey, may not be suitable for
development. If the risk is high or very high, the applicant shall submit a
site-specific report prepared by a qualified, licensed geologist specializing
in engineering geology, or a licensed civil engineer trained and experienced in
the practice of geotechnical engineering or adverse construction conditions,
depending on the issues that exist on the lot or parcel. The report shall
demonstrate the areas on the lot or parcel that are suitable for the proposed
use, recommend specific placement of structures and infrastructure, and make
specific development recommendations for mitigation. The county shall review
the report, and it may accept, modify, or reject it in its discretion. If
modified or rejected by the county, the applicant may request an independent
review, and the county will order the review by independent, qualified
professionals it selects. The professionals shall review and prepare written
findings and comments on the applicant's report. The cost of the independent,
qualified professionals shall be paid to the county by applicant. All
development shall conform to the report adopted by the land use authority in
the project approvals as conditions of development. The adopted report shall be
specifically identified on the plat and available to all potential owners,
owners, and interested parties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
the Utah Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and its Utah Geological Survey
(UGS) hazard maps for the area, as amended, are adopted.
   E.   Visual Protection: All development shall blend with the unique visual
character of the natural environment, ensuring that it blends rather than
interrupts the natural contours and elevations of the landforms. Development
shall be sited and designed to retain the existing topography and minimize
grading activities to the maximum extent. Development shall be sited so it does
not create a silhouette against the ridgelines or sky. All cuts, fills, and
grading shall be amended and revegetated with site appropriate vegetation
approved in the project plan.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4618.jpg]
   GOOD: The site selection and design of this structure keep the roofline
below the hillside and skyline, allowing it to blend in with the backdrop
created by the hillside.
Figure 2: Proposal Breaks the Hillside and Skyline[https://export.amlegal.com/
media/e92d7ad41e149be8f06ea636b3fc77df682b64ed/IMAGES/0-0-0-4620.jpg]
   BAD: The structure stands out much more clearly against the hillside and
skyline because the roofline breaks the hillside and skyline rather than
blending into the hillside.
      1.   Site Planning And Structure Height: All new construction and
associated disturbance shall occur in conformance with this chapter. Where that
is not possible due to the size and configuration of the lot, or where locating
a structure in conformance would result in a building site that is not suitable
for development. The Community Development Director or designee may require
structures to be built in the most suitable portion of the lot, designate
building pad placement, limit building height, or prescribe other design
standards to minimize the visual impact of the development. New construction
shall be designed in such a manner that prevents projection into the horizon
line or mountain backdrop. If this is not possible, and structures will project
into the horizon line as viewed from Hwy 144 or I-15, building height shall be
limited to twenty-eight feet (28'). All developments shall minimize the area
disturbed by construction activities at any given time, particularly cuts and
fills associated with road construction. Phased site grading and stabilization
or revegetation shall be part of the grading and project plan. Retaining walls
will conform with Washington County Code 10-15A, et. seq. (Ord. 2024-1273-O, 9-
17-2024; Ord. 2-18-2025)
10-31-6: OPEN SPACE, PARKS, TRAILS AND TRAILHEADS:
   A.   Required Open Space: To ensure compatibility with the mountain
environment, development shall meet the following minimum requirements:
      1.   There shall be no open space requirement for standard residential
development with a five acre minimum lot size.
      2.   For single-family or two-family development where the base zone
density is five acres or more, in order to get a density bonus of fifty percent
(50%), an applicant may propose the preservation of forty-nine percent (49%) of
the development area as open space. Clustering of the residential units is
required to obtain the density bonus.
         a.   Open space should be contiguous within a development site and, if
possible, connect with open space on adjacent parcels.
         b.   Inclusions And Exclusions In Open Space Calculation: Open space
is defined in title 10 chapter 4, and may include, naturally maintained
easement areas within which no aboveground structures are located, open space
conservation easements, and other natural areas approved by the county that
comply with the definition of open space. Open space shall not include any
portion of a lot or parcel on which any structure, parking lot or other such
feature is located. Lands that have been previously dedicated as open space as
part of a development approval shall not be considered in the open space
calculation.
         c.   Method Of Owning/Maintaining Open Space:
            (1)   Within all developments where open space is provided as part
of the development approval, ownership and maintenance responsibilities for
open space and common areas shall remain with one common owner or a POA.
            (2)   The landowner/developer is responsible for establishing legal
preservation of open space as a condition of development anytime a density
bonus is granted. Open space may be passively or actively maintained, for
private or public use. Open space and common areas shall be owned by one common
owner or a POA, or other ownership structure approved in the county's sole
discretion. Open space shall be preserved through recorded deed restrictions, a
conservation easement, or other means acceptable to the county to perpetually
protect the area. The county may, in its sole discretion, accept ownership of
all or a portion of the approved open space and own and maintain it as public
park, trail, or open space.
   B.   Pedestrian walkways, trails, or bike paths shall be provided within a
development that connect to the public walkways, trails, or bike paths in the
Washington County's Transportation Master Plan, Outdoor Recreation Master Plan
or other regional active transportation plan to serve the needs generated by
the development. If the development property is within three hundred feet
(300') of a planned public walkway, trail, or bike path on the County Plans or
public lands, the developer is responsible to construct a connection to the
planned public infrastructure. The space dedicated in trails may be included in
the calculation of the open space, as otherwise provided in this title. In the
event a public walkway, trail, or bike path on the County Plans is located on a
development parcel, pursuant to the provisions of Utah Code Annotated § 17-27a-
507, the county may require as part of the development approval that the
proportional share of the public infrastructure running through the development
site be constructed and dedicated to the public by the developer as a condition
of approval. The proportional share shall be dedicated to the county or
memorialized by a recorded public easement under terms acceptable to the
county. Private development shall preserve access to private and public lands
beyond the private development. Public infrastructure design and construction
shall be consistent with design guidelines established by county and for the
community wide active transportation system development standards.
   C.   Developments shall connect an internal trail system to community wide
trail systems where possible. The space dedicated in trails may be included in
the calculation of open space, as otherwise provided in this title.
      1.   Required: All development requiring open space shall provide it in a
manner that is sufficient to meet the specific recreational demands that will
be generated by a development. In certain instances, cash in lieu of a park,
trail, or open space area may be permitted by mutual agreement if county has
agreed to accept ownership.
      2.   Compliance With Standards: Neighborhood recreational land (parks),
facilities and trails, when provided, shall be in compliance with applicable
standards of the Washington County Transportation Plan, Southern Utah Regional
Trail Standards or regional trail and recreation plan.
      3.   Maintenance: The long term care of a park, trail, or open space area
shall be the responsibility of the one common owner or a POA.
      4.   Trailheads: Public access to major public land is required, and each
development shall maintain area required for public trailhead parking in an
amount and configuration as follows:
         a.   One vehicle space for every five hundred (500) permanent
residents in the New Harmony Valley as defined in the county's General Plan,
and one trailer space for every one thousand (1,000) permanent residents.
         b.   Trailhead parking setbacks:
            (1)   Ten feet (10') from the edge of a public or private right of
way.
            (2)   Side and rear setbacks: Ten feet from the side and rear
property lines.
            (3)   Ten feet (10') from the facade of a structure.
            (4)   Adjacent to preserved open space: No setbacks required.
         c.   If trailhead parking is provided for twenty (20) vehicles or
less, a through circulation pattern shall not be required.
         d.   At least fifteen percent (15%) of the internal portion of the
trailhead shall be landscaped using natural landscape elements, unless the
trailhead is adjacent to preserved open space, in which case the landscape
requirement shall be waived.
         e.   Parking in the road right of way may be permitted with approval
from Washington County as part of development site plan or project plan review,
in which case the setbacks and landscaping requirements would not be
applicable. Parking may be designed parallel to the curb or with a parking
angle of up to ninety degrees (90°).
            (1)   Parking surfaces may be pervious or impervious as specified
on the site plan and approved by the County.
            (2)   Concrete blocks, wheel stops, boulders, wood posts and rope
or other appropriate fencing shall be installed to ensure that no part of a
vehicle shall extend over or beyond a property line or into preserved open
space.
            (3)   If fencing is found to be appropriate to enclose the
boundaries of the established trailhead, it shall be compatible with the
surrounding environment.
            (4)   All trailhead, designated, major parking shall be designed
with a through circulation pattern, unless there is suitable turnaround space
at the end of the parking area. While in certain instances on-street parking
will be permitted, public roads shall not be used as part of a parking lot
circulation pattern or require ingress and egress from the lot to a road by
forward motion of the vehicle.
   D.   Pedestrian Nonmotorized Trail Systems:
      1.   Pedestrian walkways or nonmotorized trails shall be provided within
a development as recommended by County staff or land use authority to serve the
needs generated by the development. In the event a community wide trail as
identified on the Washington County Transportation Plan, Outdoor Recreation
Master Plan or any other approved trail plan for the New Harmony Valley, is
located on a development parcel, the county may, pursuant to the provisions of
Utah Code Annotated § 17-27a-507, require as part of the development approval
that the proportional share of the community wide trail system running through
their site be provided by the developer as a condition of approval. The
proportional share may be provided by deed, easements, or rights-of-way in
county's discretion for the community wide public trail system. When new
development applications require community benefits in exchange for increased
density as a condition of approval, trail dedication or construction will
qualify in the criteria to be considered. Trail construction shall be
consistent with the design guidelines established in the adopted Southern Utah
Regional Trail Standards and county standards.
      2.   Developments shall connect an internal trail system to community
wide trail systems. The space dedicated in trails may be included in the
calculation of the open space, as otherwise provided in this title. (Ord. 2024-
1273-O, 9-17-2024; Ord. 2-18-2025)
10-31-7: SPECIAL SITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
The criteria in this section serve the public interest by requiring that the
design of developments in the New Harmony Valley Overlay Zone be compatible
with the natural, rural characteristics of their setting and with the image of
the area which helps to support Washington County's economy. The design
requirements also help to reduce the potential for land use conflicts by
encouraging the protection of privacy and of scenic views.
   A.   Integration Of Development: Development in the New Harmony Valley shall
be integrated in a manner to promote a more complete and functional community.
Integration shall be accomplished through, among other things, pedestrian and
vehicular circulation, visual, open space, and other linkages and design
techniques. A piecemeal approach to planning and development, where individual
development parcels are designed and constructed without adequate ability to
continue infrastructure and roadway connections to undeveloped areas is not
permitted.
   B.   Building Site Plan: Building site plans for single-family detached
residential development in the PDR (Planned Development Residential) zone shall
provide the locations for the proposed building envelopes and associated
driveways when there are sensitive areas on the individual lots.
   C.   Fences And Retaining Walls: (See 10-15B)
   D.   Outdoor Lighting: See (10-15C Outdoor Lighting).
   E.   Signage: One on-premise, freestanding monument sign per New Harmony
Valley Overlay Zone development is permitted for commercial and agritourism
development not exceeding six feet in height and 10 feet in width (maximum 60
square feet), and shall be located proximate to the ingress. Only one sign per
street frontage is permitted. The monument sign shall be incorporated into the
landscape design of the development. Sign lighting shall comply with the
outdoor lighting requirements in County ordinances. The following signage and
types are prohibited: pole, roof mounted, flying, abandoned, electronic, EMS,
video, animated, temporary, inflated, painted, reflective, fluorescent,
dilapidated, A-frame, mobile, audible, off-premise, billboard, or reader board.
The back of signs shall be visually unobstructive, non-reflective, and blend in
with the setting. The visual impact of the support structure shall be
minimized.
      Sign illumination may be accomplished by fully shrouded, downward facing
fixtures and light sources in compliance with the lighting provisions herein.
      F.   In addition to the on-premise monument sign in E, above, if a
commercial property is located within 660' of the intersection of the rights-
of-way of SR-144 and I-15, and the property has more than one hundred and
twenty-five feet (125') of frontage along the UDOT or state road right-of-way,
one additional on-premise freestanding sign is permitted. The additional sign
may be a pole sign or other allowed sign type, and shall comply with County
Ord. § 10-19-3(B) and (C).
      G.   Landscaping: See Washington County Code 10-15B and 10-27-1, et seq.
(Ord. 2024-1273-O, 9-17-2024; Ord. 2-18-2025)
10-31-8: ARCHITECTURAL REGULATIONS FOR ALL STRUCTURES:
These regulations do not apply to one-family or two-family residential
dwellings, or in a PD-R with single-family or two-family dwellings, unless they
are located in an historic district or in a planned development residential
zone. These regulations are prescribed for the exterior architectural character
of all other buildings. They are intended to ensure unity in function,
structure, and artistic character. They are intended to allow and promote
creativity in design within the context of scenic Washington County, and Zion
National Park. Variety and interest in architectural designs shall be
incorporated into all structures. The incorporation of Parkitecture design,
Rustic Rural, Desert Modern, or historic pioneer architecture is strongly
encouraged.
   A.   Height: Building heights shall be compatible with other structures in
the area to preserve village scale, scenic views and to fit in with existing
development.
   B.   Setbacks: Minimum setbacks have been established by zone to soften the
impacts of structures and maximize the dominance of natural features,
vegetation and the views of New Harmony Valley.
   C.   Density: Density restrictions have been established by zone to maximize
the dominance of natural features, vegetation, the views of the Pine Valley
Mountains and Zion Canyon to preserve the human scale of the built environment.
   D.   Historic Elements: Design should be compatible with relationships of
size, massing, color, materials and horizontal facades. All new construction
shall be compatible with the "in the park" parkitecture, rustic rural, desert
modern, or historic pioneer architecture and incorporate, preserve, or
seamlessly blend with historic elements such as the rock work of Fort Harmony
or the cut stone pillars along Hwy-144.
   E.   Siding Materials:
      1.   The siding materials considered most typical of the region and
encouraged are wood siding, log, heavy timber and fiber cement materials,
native stone, and stucco. These principal materials shall be incorporated in
each building design in a manner that is consistent with the design objectives
herein.
      2.   No single wall shall contain a single or predominant treatment, but
shall include an appropriate balance of the desired principal materials
identified in this section.
      3.   Colored, textured, or split faced concrete block is prohibited.
Plastic or vinyl siding is prohibited. Reflective metal for siding or roofing
is prohibited.
   F.   The application of a stone wainscot on the lower base of the building
as the only stone application is prohibited. The design may include such
wainscot applications only when applied to wrap around the corner in other
areas of the buildings, such as at entry points, prominent walls, and other
similar applications.
   G.   Exterior Wall Architecture: Some buildings are visible from more than
one public area, such as a roadway, a public parking lot, a park, or a
residential area. In these instances, the wall treatment on all such sides of a
building shall be of a character and quality as the materials used on the front
side of the building.
   H.   Color Palette And Texture:
      1.   The predominant tones shall be colors selected from warm earth
tones, muted natural colors, or light to dark shades of wood. The natural
colors found in the area like meadow grasses or hillside vegetation are also
appropriate.
      2.   A uniform color and texture for walls is not acceptable. While color
and texture changes shall be accomplished through the use of various principal
materials described in this section, accent colors should be used. Such colors
shall be compatible with the predominant color tones of the building.
   I.   Roof Materials:
      1.   Complementary Materials: The materials used on a pitched roof shall
complement the building design and be compatible with the surrounding
environment. The color of materials on a flat roof shall blend with the color
of surrounding vegetation. Primary and closely related colors are not
permitted.
      2.   Prohibited Materials: The following materials are prohibited on any
roof:
      3.   Reflective materials (the color and slope of metal roofs shall be
carefully considered since steeper slopes may increase reflectivity).
      4.   Any bright colored or highly visible material.
   J.   Roof Shapes:
      1.   In immediately adjacent buildings, groups or clusters, particularly
in Village Commercial centers, a general roof shape should be predominant. The
smaller buildings shall vary roof shapes, like adding a pitched roof, or a mix
of flat and pitched styles. The following predominate roof styles are
prohibited; geodesic domes, conical, onion, or Mansford.
      2.   Where a pitched roof is provided on larger multiple-family,
commercial, overhangs of at least thirty-six inches (36") shall be provided.
Overhangs of greater size may be required to ensure that they are appropriately
scaled to the size of the building.
      3.   Large unbroken expanses of roof area are prohibited.
      4.   Roof design architecture may be required on thirty-five feet (35')
tall buildings to help minimize the scale of the building (i.e., extending the
eaves line below the ceiling level of the upper story). The basis for using
such techniques will depend on the visibility of the building from public
roadways and pedestrian areas.
   K.   Mechanical Equipment On Roofs: Mechanical equipment shall be hidden
with a visual barrier, so it is not readily visible from adjacent properties or
public roadways, parks or other public spaces. All rooftop mechanical equipment
shall be painted or coated with an appropriate color to blend with other
rooftop materials and minimize visual impacts.
   L.   Roof Appurtenances: Features including, but not limited to, shed
dormers, gable dormers, hip dormers and/or articulation of the roof may add
visual interest and character to minimize roof mass. Such features are required
on large pitched roofs as a means to minimize roof mass. Dormers shall be in
scale with the roof.
   M.   Window And Door Treatments:
      1.   Architecturally significant window treatment is encouraged to
minimize repetitive uniformity, and particularly where there is an associated
pedestrian streetscape.
      2.   Windows shall be adequately trimmed on the exterior, and the size of
the trim shall be in scale with the building facade. Larger trim will be
required as the scale of the building facade increases.
      3.   Careful consideration should be given to the ratio of solid wall
area to window area. In certain instances, larger and smaller windows should be
used on a facade. Window selection and placement shall avoid the monotony of
many identical windows or the confusion of too much variation in the windows.
      4.   Treatments which obscure the visual distinction between windows and
walls are not permitted.
      5.   Smoky or tinted windows are permitted. Mirrored glass is not
permitted.
   N.   Facade Length And Variations:
      1.   All walls described in section that are greater than sixty feet
(60') in length, but less than one hundred feet (100') in length, must exhibit
a prominent shift in the facade of the structure so that no greater than
seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of the facade appears linear. The
shift shall be in the form of at least a ten-foot (10') change in facade
alignment. A series of shifts may be appropriate; provided that, the cumulative
offset is at least ten feet . A combination of both a roofline and facade
change is encouraged, particularly when they occur at the same point.
      2.   All walls described in this section that exceed one hundred feet
(100') in length shall provide a prominent shift in the mass of the structure
so that no greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of the facade
appears unbroken. The shift or series of shifts in height and/or alignment that
reflect a change in function and scale is required. A shift shall be in the
form of at least a fifteen feet (15') change in facade alignment. A combination
of both a roofline and facade change is encouraged, particularly when they
occur at the same point on the facade. A series of shifts may be appropriate;
provided that, the cumulative off-set is at least fifteen feet (15').
      3.   The required shift in facade alignment shall not be created by add
on features such a porticos, porte cocheres, exterior vestibules, decks, and
other similar features.
      4.   Any long horizontal building shall include vertical design elements
to break up the building mass. The number and scale of such elements shall be
commensurate with the length of the facade.
      5.   Required vertical and horizontal elements shall not be created by
using paint schemes on the siding material.
      6.   Commercial structures comprised of various tenant spaces shall
emphasize the individuality of units by variation in rooflines, walls, or other
appropriate design techniques.
      7.   Lodging: The structure shall be situated street facing and shall
have zero lot line on either the primary or secondary façade.
   O.   Interpretation Of Standards: The above architectural requirements are
prescribed in all applicable building designs. These standards are not meant to
encourage the overuse of an existing architectural style or feature. Overuse is
discouraged. Appropriate latitude shall be allowed and creativity promoted to
achieve interest and vitality throughout the New Harmony Valley Overlay Zone.

TITLE 12
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
AUTHORITY, FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
SECTION:
12-1-1: Statutory Authorization
12-1-2: Findings Of Fact
12-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
12-1-4: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state has, in Utah Code Annotated section 17-53-223,
delegated the responsibility to the county legislative body to pass ordinances,
rules and regulations necessary and proper to provide for the public health,
safety and general welfare of its inhabitants. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affects the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purpose, this title includes methods and provisions
for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which may
increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
CHAPTER 2
DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
12-2-1: Definitions Enumerated
12-2-1: DEFINITIONS ENUMERATED:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this title its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials located within areas of special flood hazard.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so
as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of the
national flood insurance program.
EROSION HAZARD ZONE: Land adjoining a body of water or adjacent to or partially
or wholly within a delineated area of special flood hazard which due to soil
instability, is likely to suffer flood related erosion damage. The area may be
designated on the erosion hazard zone maps.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: An official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary and floodway maps.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.

and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of the national flood insurance
program.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". This term also

NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start"
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual
start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or any project for improvement of a structure
to so comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure", or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this title. A
variance permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this title.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the terms and provisions of this title and 44 CFR chapter 60.3
(d)(3).
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;

general plan designated use for that area. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-4-2: VARIANCES:
   A.   Appeal Board To Render Judgment: The appeal board as established by the
county shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this title.
   B.   Appeal Of Decision Of Floodplain Administrator: The appeal board shall
hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error
in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain
administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title.
   C.   Appeal Of Board Decision: Any person or persons aggrieved by the
decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of
competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Records And Reports: The floodplain administrator shall maintain a
record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the
federal emergency management agency upon request.

rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this title.
   F.   Lot Size: Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection J of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   G.   Conditions To Variances: Upon consideration of the factors noted above
and the intent of this title, the appeal board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this title.
   H.   Increase In Flood Levels: Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   I.   Variance Not To Preclude Historic Designation: Variances may be issued
for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   K.   Functionally Dependent Use: Variances may be issued by the county for
new construction and substantial improvements and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
      1.   The criteria outlined in subsection J of this section are met, and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)

   D.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: a)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, b) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated a minimum of two feet (2') above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      3.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-
30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
subsections D1 and D2 of this section be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of two
feet (2') above the base flood elevation, or

days,
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      3.   Meet the permit requirements and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for "manufactured homes". A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-5-3: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:

eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-5-4: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
12-3-2 of this title, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   C.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection B of this section, are satisfied.
   D.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-5-5: FLOODWAYS:
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
12-3-2 of this title, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
   A.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions.
   C.   Under the provisions of the national flood insurance regulations, a
community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the
community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through
FEMA. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-5-6: ESTABLISHMENT OF EROSION HAZARD ZONES:

within the adopted EHZ may occur only if protected by adequately designed
erosion protection, which shall be supported by engineering analysis.
      1.   All new development proposals, including subdivisions, located
within an erosion hazard area shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage. Proposals within these areas shall comply with the following
requirements:
         a.   Meet all applicable provisions of this chapter;
         b.   Meet all applicable provisions of the international building code

engineer licensed to practice in the state, which includes a hydraulic
analysis, a historical and geological evaluation of potential erosion hazards,
and an analysis of long term channel degradation, movement and bank erosion.
The study shall also include recommendations for erosion protection measures,
if any. The study shall include the engineer's professional opinion that when
the erosion protection measures, if any, are implemented, the proposed
development will not be adversely affected by erosion and that the erosion
protection measures, if any, will not adversely affect reaches or development
upstream, downstream, and across river over a one hundred (100) year planning
period;
         d.   Provide for the perpetual maintenance of the erosion protection,
if any, at no cost to the county or other public agency;

or any other flood related damage to development within an erosion hazard zone
by executing a "flood and erosion hazard disclaimer of liability and agreement"
and by placing a "notice of hazard" on the final plat if applicable;
      2.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed so as
to minimize flood damage;
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
      4.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided each lot or building pad
for all subdivision proposals and other development.
   D.   Development In Areas Without NRCS Or County Erosion Protection

            (1)   A minimum fifty foot (50') horizontal setback from the levee
top is required for all structures. Grading and revegetation to conform to
template cross section adopted in the river master plan.
            (2)   A minimum setback necessary to achieve a three to one (3:1)
slope between the top of the levee and structure grade is required. Adequately
engineered protection from erosion must be approved prior to construction. All
areas to be revegetated to conform with river master plan.
   G.   Permit Required: Any development including grading to conform to the
river master plan within the EHZ requires a development permit approved by the
floodplain administrator. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
12-5-7: CONFLICTING PROVISIONS:
If there is a conflict with any provision of this title and the building code,
the provision that is more specific shall control. (Ord. 2008-958-O, 4-1-2008)
