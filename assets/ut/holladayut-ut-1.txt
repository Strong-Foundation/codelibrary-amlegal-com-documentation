2.11.050: BID EVALUATION:
   A.   Generally: Bids, proposals, and related matters shall be evaluated
using the criteria in this section.
   B.   City's Evaluation Process: When evaluating matters, the city shall
consider the following:
      1.   Solicitation Criteria: The city shall consider the evaluation
criteria stated in a bid or proposal package or other solicitation document.
      2.   Policy Criteria: As further described in this section, the city
shall consider whether a bid, proposal or other offer or submission is
responsive to the city's request; whether the bidder or offeror is responsible;
and whether any element conflicts with the other criteria of this chapter.
         a.   Due Diligence: The city may take steps as it deems appropriate to
verify and determine any matter. The city shall determine in its sole
discretion what steps may be appropriate in light of the matters being
considered and the resources of the city. The failure to discover any matter
shall not preclude any subsequent evaluation or action.
         b.   Records: In the manner it shall determine, the purchasing agent
shall retain in the procurement file records relevant to a solicitation or
award; provided, however, that if the award contract is approved by resolution
of the city council, the city recorder shall keep the procurement file records.
         c.   Evaluating Responsiveness: To be responsive, a bid, proposal or
other offer or submission must conform in all material respects to the terms of
the city's solicitation documents. Such terms may include, without limitation,
using bid forms, mandatory submittals, required securities, and appropriate
substantive responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal
or other offer or submission will not necessarily render it nonresponsive, and
the purchasing agent shall review such matters and determine whether the
submission is responsive. The purchasing agent may evaluate responsiveness
based on any additional reasonable criteria.
         d.   Evaluating Responsibility: To be responsible, a bidder or offeror
must have the capability in all respects to fully perform the agreement
requirements, and the integrity, capacity and reliability which will assure
timely, proper performance.
         e.   Factors: The city may consider any relevant factors when
evaluating responsibility, including, without limitation, the following:
            (1)   The bidder's capacity to perform the contractual
requirements, including whether the bidder has available appropriate financial,
material, equipment, facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the
ability to obtain them. Without limitation, capacity may also include legal
capacity to enter agreements, the ability to perform within required times, or
the ability to perform any necessary future service and maintenance.
            (2)   The bidder's ability, skill and quality of performance.
            (3)   The bidder's character, integrity, reputation, judgment,
experience and efficiency.
            (4)   The bidder's ability to work cooperatively with the city,
including, without limitation, whether the bidder has previously failed to
comply with city agreements or other requirements; nonpayment of sums due to
the city; poor working relationships with or adversarial actions against the
city; prior suspension or other proceedings by the city against the bidder; or
failure to assist the city in determining responsibility.
         f.   Making A Determination: The submission of any bid, proposal or
other offer or submission constitutes an agreement by the bidder or offeror to
reasonably assist the city with its determination of responsibility.
         g.   Effect Of Determination: The city's determination of
responsibility relates solely to a bidder's overall ability to perform for a
specific procurement, and is not a general assessment of a bidder's
capabilities.
         h.   Evaluating Specific Matters: For any bid, proposal, other offer,
or submission:
            (1)   Tie Bids: Tie bids occur when identical prices are submitted
from responsive and responsible bidders and that price is the low bid. The
purchasing agent shall make an award in a manner that is beneficial to the
city, and may make an award in a manner that will discourage tie bids. Such may
include:
               (A)   Award to the person closest to the point of delivery.
               (B)   Award to the person who previously held the agreement.
               (C)   Award to the person with the earliest delivery date.
            (2)   Only One Bid Received: If the city receives only one
responsive bid, proposal or other offer or submission, the city may make an
award to that bidder or offeror if the purchasing agent determines that the
bid, proposal or other offer or submission is fair and reasonable and conforms
to all applicable requirements, and that other prospective bidders or offerors
had reasonable opportunity to respond or that there is not adequate time for a
resolicitation. The written determination and basis for decision by the
purchasing agent shall be placed in the procurement file. Alternatively, the
city may reject the sole bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
         i.   Inspections And Tests: The city may perform inspections, tests
and other evaluations in any manner conducive to the city's interest,
including, without limitation, the use of third parties. All prospective and
actual recipients of a bid or agreement shall provide all reasonable assistance
and information required by the city to perform any such inspection, test or
other evaluation.
         j.   Modifying Submissions: After the time for submission, a bid,
proposal or other offer or submission may be modified as follows:
            (1)   Confirmation: When it appears a mistake has been made, or
when the city desires an assurance of any matter, the city may request a bidder
or offeror to confirm in writing such bid, proposal or other offer or
submission.
            (2)   Notification Of Error: A bidder or offeror shall notify the
purchasing agent of any error contained in a bid, proposal or other offer or
submission within two (2) business days after bid opening or the time for
submitting proposals unless the purchasing agent waives this requirement. The
purchasing agent shall have sole discretion to determine whether to permit any
such modification or withdrawal.
            (3)   Modifications By Agreement: The purchasing agent may agree
with a bidder or offeror to any modifications so long as they do not prejudice
fair competition or the city's interests. Modifications may include such
matters as the following:
               (A)   Time For Accepting: The purchasing agent and bidder or
offeror may agree that a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will remain
effective for a longer period of time than that stated in the bid, proposal or
other offer or submission.
               (B)   Subcontractor Or Supplier Changes: Any proposed change in
subcontractors or suppliers must be submitted to the purchasing agent, and the
purchasing agent may reject any such proposed change. The bidder or offeror
will receive no additional compensation as a result of a change to any
subcontractors or suppliers, and must continue to meet the requirements of any
federally mandated program and other contractual and legal requirements.
               (C)   Change In Specifications: The purchasing agent and bidder
or offeror may agree to a change in specifications when such change is in the
city's interest, is reasonably related to the work originally solicited, and
would not be prejudicial to fair competition.
               (D)   City's Correction Of Ministerial Mistakes: The purchasing
agent may at any time correct mistakes in a bid or proposal that are of a
ministerial or minor nature. Ministerial or minor informalities are clerical
errors and matters of form rather than substance that are evident from the
document, or insignificant mistakes or informalities that can be waived or
corrected without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. They generally do not
have a substantial effect on price. Examples include a failure to:
                  (i) Sign the bid, proposal, or other submissions requiring
signature, but only where they are accompanied by other materials indicating
intent to be bound.
                  (ii) Acknowledge receipt of an addendum, but only if the
materials demonstrate the bidder or offeror received the addendum and intended
to be bound by it, or the addendum has a negligible effect on the bid, proposal
or other offer or submission.
               (E)   City's Correction Of Mistakes Where The Intent Is Evident:
If the intent of the bid, proposal or other offer or submission is clearly
evident on the face of the document, the purchasing agent shall correct it as
intended and it may not be withdrawn. Examples include:
                  (i) Typographical errors. Errors in extending unit prices.
Transposition errors. Arithmetical errors.
                  (ii) Differences in written and numerical prices (written
shall control).
               (F)   No Withdrawal For Mistakes Where Intent Is Not Evident: If
the bidder or offeror's intent is not clearly evident on the face of the
document, the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be withdrawn
except as agreed by the purchasing agent.
               (G)   Correcting Errors In Judgment: Errors in judgment may not
be corrected, and the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be
withdrawn, except as agreed by the purchasing agent. The purchasing agent may
allow correction of an error in judgment if it can be done without prejudice to
other bidders or offerors. The purchasing agent may allow withdrawal if it is
in the city’s interest.(Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.060: RESPONSIBILITY OF BIDDERS AND OFFERORS:
Bid and performance bonds or other security as specified on the city’s bid form
are required on all construction contracts in excess of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) (or such lesser threshold as may be required from time to
time by state law) and may be requested for supply agreements or service
agreements as the purchasing agent deems advisable to protect the city’s
interests. Any such bonding requirements shall be set forth in the
solicitation. Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a
determination of a bidder or offeror’s responsibility. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-
2025)

   B.   Audit the books, accounting and any applicable records of any
contractor or subcontractor. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)

among any bidders or offerors, a notice of the relevant facts shall be
transmitted to the city attorney. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.090: PREQUALIFICATION:
Where deemed appropriate by the city, bidders, proponents and/or suppliers may
be prequalified for particular types of supplies, services and construction to
determine the responsibility of such persons.
   A.   Standard Of Responsibility: Factors to be considered in determining
whether the standard of responsibility has been met by a bidder or supplier in
connection with a prequalification include:
      1.   Availability of the appropriate financial, material, equipment,
facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the ability to obtain them,
necessary to indicate the capability of the bidder or supplier to meet all
contractual requirements;
      2.   A satisfactory record of performance;
      3.   A satisfactory record of integrity;
      4.   Legal qualifications to contract with the city; and
      5.   Whether all necessary information has been supplied in connection
with the inquiry concerning responsibility.
   B.   Information Pertaining To Responsibility: In connection with a proposed
prequalification, the bidder, proponent or supplier shall supply information
requested by the city concerning the responsibility of such person. If such
information is not supplied, the city shall base its determination of
responsibility upon any available information or may find the bidder or
supplier nonresponsible if such failure is unreasonable, as determined by the
city. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.100: COMPETITIVE BIDDING:
   A.   Conditions For Use: The city may use competitive sealed bidding or
other processes designed to assure competitive bidding except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.
   B.   Invitation For Bids: Each bid proceeding shall be commenced by the
purchasing agent or designee issuing an invitation for bids, which shall
include specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to
the procurement, and otherwise shall be in compliance with this chapter. All
specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the
purposes intended and to encourage competition in satisfying the city’s needs,
and shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy set forth in this section
applies to all specifications including, without limitation, those prepared for
the city by architects, engineers, designers, and draftsmen.
   C.   Public Notice: All noticing shall be processed through the city
recorder or designee. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall

acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and
suitability for a particular purpose. The invitation for bids shall set forth
the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation
that are not set forth in the invitation for bids. Those criteria that will
affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award (such as

objectively measurable.
   F.   Correction Or Withdrawal Of Bids; Cancellation Of Awards: Correction or
withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or
cancellation of awards or agreements based on such bid mistakes, may be
permitted by the purchasing agent where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before
bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written, digital or facsimile
notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to
the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be
permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing
evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of
the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After the bid opening, no
changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest
of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction,
a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw
its bid if:
      1.   The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but
the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
      2.   The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly
demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or
withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or agreements based on bid mistakes,
shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agent.
   G.   Award: Award shall be made with reasonable promptness by reasonable
notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the
requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, unless
otherwise provided for in this chapter. Such notice shall be sent by mail,
electronic mail and/or by posting on the city’s website.
   H.   Multistep Sealed Bidding: When it is considered impractical to prepare
an initial purchase description to support an award based on price, an
invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers
to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers
have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth
in the first solicitation.
   I.   Cancellation Of Invitation For Bids: An invitation for bids or other
solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected
in whole or in part, as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is in the
city’s interest. Each solicitation issued by the city shall state that the
solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in
whole or in part when in the best interests of the city. Notice of cancellation
shall be sent to all persons responding to the solicitation, which notice shall
identify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation and, where
appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any
resolicitation or any future procurement of similar items. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-
2025)
2.11.110: COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS (RFP):

proposals method described in this section.
   B.   Request For Proposals: Competitive proposals shall be solicited through
a request for proposals (“RFP”).

the offerors, shall be disclosed to competing offerors during the process of
negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared containing the name of
each offeror, the number of modifications received, if any, and a description
sufficient to identify the item offered. The register of proposals shall be
open for public inspection only after award.
   E.   Evaluation Factors: The RFP shall state the relative importance of
price and other evaluation factors, including the quantitative basis for
evaluation. No criteria may be used in an RFP response evaluation that is not
set forth in the RFP.
   F.   Discussion With Responsible Offerors And Revisions To Proposals: As
provided in the RFP, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who
submit proposals determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected in
order to clarify and assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the
solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment
to discuss and revise proposals in writing and such written revisions may be
permitted after submissions and prior to award to obtain best and final offers.
In conducting such discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information
derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors, except for the names of
the offerors.
   G.   Award: Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into
consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP. No other
factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The file shall contain the
basis on which the award is made.
   H.   Cancellation Of An RFP: An RFP or other solicitation may be canceled,
or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part, as may be
specified in the solicitation, when it is in the best interests of the city.
Each solicitation issued by the city shall state that the solicitation may be
canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in whole or in part when
in the city’s best interest. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all
persons responding to the solicitation. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)

2025)
2.11.140: STATE CONTRACT PURCHASING:
Because an appropriate bid procedure has already been completed by the state of
Utah, any item that is a state contract or cooperative pricing contract item

provided that the purchasing agent or department head making the purchase shall
document the state contract number used and record that information in the
purchase file. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.150: RECENT PURCHASES BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY:
When purchasing supplies, material or equipment from a vendor who has been
awarded a bid for the same items from another governmental entity within the
preceding ninety (90) days, the price paid by the other governmental entity
shall be deemed to be the lowest price available for such items and the city
need not follow any other bidding requirements, provided that the purchasing
agent or department head making the purchase shall maintain in the purchase
file appropriate documentation demonstrating compliance with the requirements
of this section. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.160: CONTRACTING FOR DESIGNATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES:

(Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.170: CONTRACTS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES:
Whenever the city agrees to make purchases together with another governmental
entity, and the agreement is entered in compliance with the solicitation
procedures of that other entity, the city shall be deemed to have complied with
the city’s solicitation requirements. Contracted services from other
governmental entities are exempt from any requirements to obtain bids or
quotes. Unless not legally required, all contracts with other governmental
entities shall comply with the Utah Interlocal Cooperation Act and shall be
approved by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.180: SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT:
   A.   Definition: Without limitation, sole source procurement may arise when:
      1.   The city needs a supply or service of a unique or specialized
nature, and only one known supplier is reasonably available to meet the need.
      2.   Specific parts, accessories, equipment, materials, services,
proprietary items or other items are necessary to meet the city's needs, and
there are no comparable items reasonably available.
      3.   Items are procured for resale.
   B.   Procedure: To use sole source procurement, the purchasing agent shall
place a written determination in the procurement file after conducting a good
faith review of available sources, stating why no other sources are reasonably
available, or why competition would not be likely to produce other acceptable
offers. Sole source procurement shall not be used only to accommodate a desire
for a particular proprietary item unless the city has a very specific need for
such item which can be justified in writing. The city shall be deemed to have a
very specific need when there is a need to procure matching or compatible
supplies and services and when other similar supplies and services would not be
reasonably beneficial to the city's needs. The purchasing agent or designee
shall negotiate and use appropriate means to obtain the best price available
for any item procured under this section. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.190: EMERGENCIES, PUBLIC THREATS AND UNFORESEEN CONDITIONS:
   A.   Generally: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, and
conditioned on prior appropriation of necessary funds by the city council, the
purchasing agent may make, or authorize others to make, emergency procurement
of supplies, services, or construction items when there exists a threat to
public health, welfare, or safety; provided that procurement in response to
such emergencies, public threats or unforeseen conditions shall be made with
such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Procurement made on
this basis shall occur as set forth in this section, subject, however, to any
contrary requirements of, or procedures under, Utah state law or any emergency
management plan for the city from time to time in effect.
   B.   Definitions: The conditions specified in this section are defined as
follows:
   EMERGENCY CONDITION: Creates an immediate and serious need for supplies or
services that cannot adequately be addressed using normal procurement methods.
Such a need may arise by reason of a natural disaster, epidemic, riot,
equipment failure or other reason.
   PUBLIC THREATS: Circumstances that appear likely to adversely impact the
public's health, welfare, convenience or safety. They may arise when
circumstances appear to create a risk of environmental contamination, traffic
congestion or hazards, disruption of utility or other public services, or other
matters.
   UNFORESEEN CONDITION: Creates a need to procure supplies or services within
time frames that could not reasonably be anticipated or accommodated under
normal procurement methods.
   C.   Procedure: The purchasing agent shall examine the circumstances and
determine whether they constitute a condition set forth above. If so, the
purchasing agent may take any action required by such condition. The purchasing
agent shall place in the procurement file a written determination and
explanation of the condition. Procurement should be as competitive as possible
under the circumstances, but priority shall be given to meeting the needs of
the emergency or combating the public threat. Only those supplies and services
impacted by the condition in question may be acquired under this section. (Ord.
2025-07, 5-15-2025)
2.11.200: PROCUREMENT PROTESTS:

the solicitation or award of a contract for procurement may protest the
procurement by filing a written protest with the purchasing agent. The protest
shall contain the following information:
   A.   The protesting party's name, mailing address and daytime telephone
number, the signature of the protesting party or the attorney for the
protesting party, and the date the protest is signed; and
   B.   The relief sought, a statement of facts and a recitation of the reasons
and legal authority in support of the protest sufficient to permit review.
   C.   Protests shall be submitted prior to the closing date for receiving
bids or proposals unless the protestor did not know and could not reasonably
have known of the facts giving rise to the protest prior to such time, but in
any event, all protests shall be submitted within five (5) business days after
the closing date for receiving bids or proposals.
   D.   The city may proceed with the procurement despite the protest, except
that the purchasing agent may suspend the procurement process for so long as
they determine is appropriate.
   E.   The purchasing agent may designate another individual to assist in
reviewing the matter, which assistance may include finding facts, analyzing the
protest, and making recommendations to the purchasing agent.
   F.   The purchasing agent or designee may request additional information
from the protesting party or from other persons to make a determination. The
protesting party shall provide all information requested by the purchasing
agent reasonably needed to decide the protest except information which is
protected from disclosure by law, or which could reasonably be expected to
result in unfair competitive injury to the protestor.
   G.   The purchasing agent shall review and decide protests, and shall issue
a written determination to the protesting party within fifteen (15) business
days of receipt of the protest.
   H.   The protesting party may appeal the written decision of the purchasing
agent by filing a written appeal with the manager within five (5) business days
of the purchasing agent's written determination. Unless otherwise agreed to by
the city and the appellant, the hearing shall be held no sooner than five (5)
business days and no later than thirty (30) business days after the date that
the appeal is filed.
   I.   At the hearing before the manager, the appellant and the city's
representative shall be allowed to testify, present evidence, and comment on
the issues. The manager also may allow other interested persons to testify,
comment or provide evidence on the issues.
   J.   No later than fifteen (15) business days after the hearing, the manager
shall issue a signed order either granting the appeal in whole or in part, or
upholding the determination of the purchasing agent in whole or in part. The
order of the manager shall include:
      1.   The decision, and any reasons for the decision the manager may wish
to provide; and
      2.   A statement that any party to the appeal may appeal the decision to
the district court.
   K.   If the manager fails to issue a decision within fifteen (15) business
days after the hearing, said failure shall be considered the equivalent of an
order denying the appeal.
   L.   The manager may appoint a person other than the purchasing agent to
fulfill the manager’s responsibilities under this section. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-15-
2025)
2.11.210: SANCTIONS:
   A.   It is unlawful:

may be discharged or suspended from employment, and the city may seek
additional appropriate legal redress.
   C.   At the discretion of the city council, the following contracts are
voidable:
      1.   Contracts which result from a conflict of interest under this
chapter or other applicable law;
      2.   Contracts awarded to a person or firm that tried to influence the
award of such contract by offering something of value to any city officer or
city employee; and
      3.   Contracts awarded by a city officer or city employee circumventing
the requirements of this chapter or other applicable statute.
   D.   The city council hereby declares its intent that the contracts
described in subsections C1 through C3 of this section would not have been
entered into on behalf of the city if such misconduct had been discovered prior
to the execution of the contract. In this regard, the council further states
that no city officer or city employee has authority, either actual, apparent or
implied, to negotiate or execute any such contract and that such contract
shall, at the discretion of the city council, be voidable, unless the action of
the city officers or city employees in executing the contract is ratified by
affirmative action of the city council after the misconduct was discovered and
made known to the city council.
   E.   All persons or firms responsible for any misconduct prohibited by this
section shall be liable to the city for any losses incurred by the city
resulting from any contract awarded due to such misconduct. (Ord. 2025-07, 5-

5.06.080: FEES AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACTIVITIES:

commerce, he may apply to the license official for an adjustment of that fee.
Such application may be made before, at, or within six (6) months after payment
of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit and supporting
testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross
volume of business, and such other information as the license official may deem
necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on
commerce. The license official shall then conduct an investigation, comparing
applicant's business with other businesses of like nature, and shall make
findings of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed by this
chapter is discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to such applicant's
business, and shall recommend to the mayor a license fee for the applicant in
an amount that is nondiscriminatory, reasonable and fair. If the mayor is
satisfied that such license fee is the amount that the applicant should pay, it
shall fix the license fee in such amount. If the regular license fee has
already been paid, the mayor shall order a refund of the amount over and above
the fee fixed by the license official. In fixing the fee to be charged, the
license official shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of
gross sales, or employees, or may use any other method that will assure that

nature; provided, however, that the amount assessed shall not exceed the fee
prescribed in the "general business license" section of the fee schedule. (1999
Code)

imposed by this title to keep and preserve for a period of three (3) years such
books and records which accurately reflect the amount of his gross annual sale
of goods and services for any year for which an exemption is claimed, and the
number of employees, from which can be determined the amount of any license fee
for which he may be liable under this title. (1999 Code)

be due and payable each year on or before the first day of the month in which
the license was originally issued. If the license is not paid within one month

fee shall be added to the original amount due. If the fee is still not paid
within two (2) months after the due date, a one hundred percent (100%) penalty
of the amount of the fee shall be added to the original amount due. If the fee
plus penalty is still not paid within three (3) months, the business shall be
considered to be operating without a business license in violation of this
title, subject to criminal prosecution for every day of operation after three
(3) months from the due date and the license fee, if a license is granted

such rehabilitation that shall provide, among other things, acceptable bonding.
The plan for rehabilitation shall be in the form of the following:
      1.   A description of all phases of the contemplated operation and the
specific mention of the type of machinery and equipment that will or might be
necessary to the performance of the operation. When the excavation operation
shall include the washing of sand and gravel, the estimated daily quantity of
water required, its source and disposition, shall be made a part of the
description;

completion of excavation of such section and shall be completed before
excavation may begin on the fourth ten (10) acre section, and so forth.

The city has an interest in protecting the well being, tranquility, and privacy
of the home. The privacy includes an ability to avoid unwelcome intrusions, and
the city has a responsibility to protect citizens from such intrusions. The
city also has an interest in protecting consumers from inappropriate or
fraudulent practices and to protect its citizens from criminal activity such as
disorderly conduct, theft, trespass and assault. The city has a responsibility
to protect its citizens from actual harm as well as to protect them from
potential harm, which may result in unregulated door to door solicitation.
There must be a balance of these legitimate interests of the city and the
effect of the regulations on the rights of those who are regulated. Based upon
the information which the city has considered and the experience of its
officers and those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, the
city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this chapter
are tailored narrowly to preserve and protect the city interests reflected
herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated. (Ord.

codes is an important public activity. Code enforcement is vital to the
protection of the public health, safety, welfare and quality of life. The city
council recognizes that code enforcement is effective only when done quickly

declares that it would have adopted this title and each section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase, portion or provision thereof, irrespective of the

animals creating a "nuisance", as defined in this title, shall be guilty of
allowing a nuisance in violation of this title and subject to the penalties
provided herein. (Ord. 2012-16, 6-21-2012)
8.06.020: PUBLIC NUISANCE ANIMAL:
The term "public nuisance animal" shall mean and include, but is not limited
to, any animal that:
   A.   Is repeatedly found at large;
   B.   Damages the property of anyone other than its owner;
   C.   Repeatedly molests or intimidates neighbors, pedestrians or passersby
by lunging at fences, chasing, or acting aggressively toward such person,
unless provoked by such person;

annoyance or discomfort to neighbors or others;
   G.   Causes unsanitary conditions in enclosures or surroundings where the

owner of such property, unless the handler of such animal shall have in his or
her possession the instruments to clean up after his or her animal and shall
remove the animal's feces to a proper trash receptacle;
   I.   Is offensive or dangerous to the public health, safety, or welfare by
virtue of the number and/or types of animals kept or harbored;
   J.   Attacks people or other animals, whether such attack results in actual
physical harm to the person or animal to whom or at which the attack is

of Utah law;
   L.   Cannot be restrained by normal restraints, such as standard leashes,
standard chains, or muzzles; or
   M.   Cannot be effectively controlled by its owner or handler.
The fact, or evidence of the fact, that the factors alleged to have caused the
animal to be a nuisance are inherent and/or natural behavior for such animal,
or the action of the owner or animal are otherwise legal, shall not negate or
excuse a charge of nuisance. (Ord. 2012-16, 6-21-2012)
8.06.030: ANIMAL NUISANCE ABATEMENT:
   A.   Authority: If the director has reasonable grounds to believe that an
animal constitutes a "public nuisance animal", as defined herein, and that such
nuisance necessitates immediate abatement, he/she may issue an abatement order,
by mail or posting, giving the animal owner or keeper seven (7) days to abate
the animal nuisance. If the animal nuisance is not abated within seven (7) days
after delivery of the abatement notice, an animal control officer may seize the
animal pending delivery of an order concerning the disposition of the animal by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Each day that an owner or keeper allows an
animal nuisance to persist beyond seven (7) days following delivery of an
abatement notice will constitute a separate violation of this title.
   B.   Costs: If the court determines that the animal in question is not a
nuisance and/or need not be abated for the public health and safety, the city
shall cause the animal to be returned to the owner or handler forthwith, and
shall assume the responsibility for the costs incurred while the animal is
under the care and keeping of the city. If the court determines that the animal
in question constitutes a public nuisance, the owner or handler shall be liable
to the city for the cost incurred by the city for the animal's care and keeping
while the matter is before the courts, and for the cost of destroying the
animal. (Ord. 2012-16, 6-21-2012)
8.06.040: ANIMAL BITES; REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Time Limit For Reporting: Persons who obtain knowledge that an animal
has bitten another animal or a human shall report the facts to the director
within twenty four (24) hours of the bite, regardless of whether the biting
animal is of a species subject to rabies.
   B.   Medical Personnel: A physician, or other medical personnel, who renders
professional treatment to a person bitten by an animal shall report that fact
to the director and the health department within twenty four (24) hours of his/
her first professional attendance. Said report shall include the name, sex and
address of the person bitten as well as the type and location of the bite. If
known, the person making the report shall give the name and address of the
owner of the animal that inflicted the bite, and any other facts that may

bitten, injured or mauled by another animal shall report that fact to the
director. The report shall contain the name and address of the owner of the

which caused the injury, and a description of the animal, if known, which
caused the injury, and the location of the incident.

unless such animal is under secure restraint and muzzled and/or confined so as
to prevent it from injuring any person, property, or other animal. The owner of
any dangerous or vicious animal shall microchip the animal and register the
microchip number with the director. Every animal so vicious and dangerous that
it cannot be controlled by reasonable restraints, and every dangerous and
vicious animal not effectively controlled by its owner or person having charge,
care or control of such animal, so that it shall not injure any person or
property, is a hazard to public safety, and the director may take the same
action in regards to such animal as is permitted in section
8.06.030 of this chapter, or may seek a court order for destruction of or
muzzling of the animal. (Ord. 2012-16, 6-21-2012)

animal, without the permission of the owner or handler thereof, and/or to
confine an animal in a place unknown to the owner or handler; or to conceal an

or ferret at any time to run at large. The owner or handler of a dog or ferret
shall be liable in damages for injury committed by such dog or ferret and it
shall not be necessary in any action brought thereof to allege or prove that
such dog or ferret was of a vicious or mischievous disposition or that the
owner or keeper thereof knew that it was vicious or mischievous. (Ord. 2012-16,

Any owner or person having charge, care, custody or control of any female dog
in heat shall, in addition to restraining such dog from running at large, cause
such dog to be constantly confined in a building or other structure so as to
prevent it from attracting by scent or coming into contact with other dogs and
creating a nuisance. (Ord. 2012-16, 6-21-2012)
8.06.120: DOGS PROHIBITED IN DESIGNATED AREAS:

behavior which would cause a reasonable person to feel they were in danger of
immediate physical attack.

person under subsection A of this section shall be in addition to any penalties
or liabilities imposed upon such person by any other law or ordinance.

plat, obtaining a building permit, or commencing development, the following are
required:
      1.   An improvement agreement is to be executed for all required
improvements.
      2.   A guarantee for all improvements that have not been inspected and
accepted by the City, and that are:
         a.   Publicly owned and maintained;
         b.   Public landscaping improvements;
         c.   Essential or required to meet the building code or fire code;
         d.   Required to meet natural hazard mitigation and stormwater
management requirements;
         e.   Required to meet street standards and access requirements; or
         f.   Essential to public safety requirements adopted in a land use
regulation, as determined by the City Engineer or Director.
   D.   Improvement Agreement and Guarantee: Prior to recording a plat or
commencing any development, the developer shall provide to the City an
improvement agreement and a guarantee in accordance with the following
requirements.
      1.   Developer Responsibility. The developer is responsible for compliant
completion and warranty of all improvements. Developer shall timely complete
the improvements and guarantee the improvements be free of defects in materials
and workmanship in accordance with this Title, the improvement agreement, and
all other applicable approvals, regulations, standards, and specifications.
      2.   Forms, Duration, Terms. The developer shall execute an improvement
agreement and guarantee using forms that are acceptable to the City. The
guarantee shall run to the benefit of the City and shall remain in effect until
the City approves a partial release. The improvement agreement and guarantee
shall contain language that promises and ensures compliant completion and
warranty of the improvements by the developer. The guarantee shall contain a
provision for unconditional payment of the face amount of the guarantee within
ten business days from the date the City makes a written declaration of
developer’s failure to perform pursuant to this Section.
      3.   Improvement Assurance Warranty Period; Improvement Warranty
Guarantee.
         a.   Developer shall provide an unconditional warranty that
improvements comply with the City’s standards for design, materials, and
workmanship and will be free of defects in materials and workmanship for 12
months following the date when the improvements are inspected and approved by
the City Engineer, unless the City Engineer determines, for good cause, that a
12- month period would be inadequate to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare; or has substantial evidence, on record of prior poor performance by
the developer; or has substantial evidence that the area upon which the
improvements will be constructed contains suspect soil and the City has not
otherwise required the applicant to mitigate the suspect soil. Improvements
listed on the same calculation shall have the same improvement warranty period.
         b.   Financial assurance shall be required for the duration of the
improvement warranty period, in the amount set forth in this Section, to secure
performance of replacement and repairs of improvements in accordance with
developer’s unconditional warranty.
      4.   Amount of the Guarantee and Improvement Warranty Guarantee.
         a.   The amount of the guarantee shall be determined by the City
Engineer. The amount of the guarantee shall be 100 percent of the cost of
construction plus ten percent (10%) of that amount to cover administrative
costs incurred by the City to complete the improvements, if necessary.
         b.    During the improvement warranty period the amount of the
improvement assurance warrantee guarantee shall be either (a) ten percent (10%)
of the amount shown on the calculation or (b) ten percent (10%) of the
developer’s reasonable proven cost of completed improvements, whichever is
less, except the guarantee for the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
requirements shall not be reduced and shall remain at 100 percent.
      5.   Developer Shall Complete Improvements in a Timely Manner. All
improvements shall be completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer within
one year from the date the guarantee is posted with the City, unless the
developer requests an extension in writing, and the extension is approved by
the Director and City Engineer for good cause. The developer shall execute an
improvement agreement promising completion within the required time, and the
improvement agreement shall be amended accordingly.
      6.   Sequence for Completion of Improvements. To protect the health,
safety and welfare of the City and its residents from traffic, flood, drainage
or other hazards, the City Engineer may require that the improvements be
completed or repaired in a specified sequence and/or within a specified period
of time, which may be less than one year. The City Engineer will notify the
developer in writing of that requirement if the City Engineer deems such action
necessary.
      7.   Failure to Complete Improvements in a Timely Manner. If the
developer fails to satisfactorily complete the improvements within one year
from the date when the guarantee is posted, or within the shorter time period
specified by the City Engineer in order to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the City and its residents from traffic, flood, drainage or other
hazards, or as extended by the City Engineer pursuant to this Section, the City
may, in its sole discretion, pursue all lawful remedies, including without
limitation, declaring the developer in default of the improvement agreement,
declaring the guarantee forfeited by the developer, and demanding payment
pursuant to the terms of the guarantee. The City may spend the funds to pay for
construction, replacement, or repair of incomplete or defective improvements,
as well as the City’s administrative overhead and any other associated costs
incurred by the City. The City may take any other action it deems appropriate
to enforce the improvement agreement, collect on the guarantee, recover amounts
not covered by the guarantee and any other civil or criminal remedies allowable
by law, which may include liens.
      8.   Initiating Inspections. The developer on record shall request
inspections when installed improvements are complete, at the end of an
improvement warranty period, and/or after correcting deficiencies noted in a
prior inspection. The request shall contain a statement affirming that all
improvements are complete and/or all deficiencies have been corrected.
Inspections will be scheduled by the City Engineer upon receiving the
developer’s written request. The City Engineer may schedule an inspection,
without a written request from the developer, upon determination that the time
for completion of an improvement warranty period has expired.
      9.   Developer Shall Correct Deficiencies in a Timely Manner. The
developer shall correct any deficiencies noted by City inspectors within 30
days from the time the inspector notifies the developer. Extensions may be
authorized by the City Engineer for good cause beyond the developer’s control
after receipt of a written request and explanation from the developer.
      10.   Partial Release of Guarantee. Upon completion of the improvements
listed on an individual calculation, and inspection and approval of those
improvements by the City Engineer, the City may release up to 90 percent (90%)
of the portion of the calculated guarantee amount.
      11.   Final Release of Guarantee. Upon completion of the improvements
warranty period for the improvements listed on an individual calculation, and
the subsequent inspection and approval of those improvements by the City
Engineer, the City will release all remaining portions of the guarantee amount
shown on that calculation.
      12.   Acceptable Types of Guarantees. Guarantees shall be approved by the
City and may be either:
         a.   An irrevocable letter of credit, containing information required
by the City, from a bank or credit union chartered under the laws of the State
of Utah or the United States of America, licensed and regulated by the

insured by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation or National Credit

has or will notify all contractors and subcontractors that the City will not
release any portion of the guarantee until all improvements on a calculation
are completed and the work has been inspected and accepted by the City
Engineer, at which time the City will release no more than the portions allowed
under this Section.
   E.   Construction of Improvements Prior to Plat Recordation or Issuance of
Building Permit. If the developer desires to complete the improvements prior to
recording a subdivision plat or prior to receiving a building permit, the
developer may post an alternative guarantee in accordance with the following
requirements.
      1.   The alternative guarantee shall be in an amount determined by the
City Engineer to remove incomplete improvements and restore disturbed property,

      2.   After posting the alternative guarantee, the developer may complete
all improvements, except that no plat will be recorded, and no building permit
will be issued by the City.
      3.   When the improvements have been completed, inspected and approved by
the City Engineer, the developer shall provide the improvement warranty
guarantee as set forth in D.4.b. Upon the developer posting the improvement
warranty guarantee, the City will release the subdivision plat to be recorded,

requirements have been satisfied.
   F.   Fee In Lieu Of Required Improvements:
      1.   Where present conditions exist which make it unfeasible or
impractical to install any required public improvements, the city may require
the subdivider to pay to the city a fee equal to the estimated cost of such
improvements as determined by the director of community development. Upon
payment of the fee by the developer, the city shall assume the responsibility
for future installation of such improvements.
      2.   The City Manager or designee shall establish a special account for
such fees and shall credit to such account a proportioned share of interest
earned from investment of city monies. Records relating to identification of

   G.   Waiver For Political Subdivisions: When the developer is a school
district, municipality, service area, special purpose district or other
political subdivision of the state, the city may waive the bond and accept a
letter from the governing body guaranteeing installation of the improvements.
Before approving any such waiver, the city shall receive a recommendation from
the Community and Economic Development Director. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd.

among other things, consider:
            (1)   Staff reports;
            (2)   Testimony presented at a public hearing or meeting;
            (3)   Personal knowledge of conditions and activities bearing on
the issue at hand; and
            (4)   The effect that a particular proposal may have on existing
conditions and activities and upon orderly development of the city.
         c.   The land use authority shall state on the record the rationale
for its decision.

         d.   Permitted use;
         e.   Temporary use permit;
         f.   Sign permit;
         g.   Building permit;

applied to a factually distinct, individual circumstance but which is not an
appeal.

based on the "substantial evidence" standard as follows:
         a.   Any administrative land use application for which substantial
evidence in the record shows compliance with requirements applicable to the
application shall be approved.
            (1)   "Substantial evidence" is that quantity and quality of
relevant evidence adequate to convince a reasonable mind to support a
conclusion.
            (2)   Modifications may be imposed to conform an application with
applicable requirements of this title.
         b.   A decision under this subsection shall include at least the
following elements:
            (1)   A statement of approval, approval with requirements, or
disapproval, as the case may be; and
            (2)   A summary of evidence presented which forms the basis for the
decision, including specific references to applicable standards set forth in
this title, other provisions of this code, or other applicable law.

be fundamentally fair, which for the purpose of this title means:

title and fair procedure is applied to the proceeding; and

13.10A.010: PURPOSE:
   Promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the City of Holladay in the matter of Subdivisions or matters
affected by Subdivisions through provisions designed to:
   A.   To promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the
residents of the City;
   B.   To ensure the efficient and orderly subdivision and development of land
within the City:
   C.   To prevent the uncontrolled division and development of real property,
which may be done without considering the rights and best interests of
adjoining property owners and the City as a whole:
   D.   To avoid subdivisions and developments that:
      1.   Do not comply with the City general plan or ordinances,
      2.   Cannot be adequately served by existing utilities or public
services,
      3.   May prove to be dangerous or unsafe due to design, natural or man-
made hazards existing prior to or created by the subdivision and development,
      4.   May cause an unjustifiable burden on existing traffic or
transportation services, or
      5.   May require the future expenditure of public funds to correct
problems caused by the subdivision and development;
   E.   To provide design standards for public improvements, facilities, and
utilities to provide for reasonable access to public rights-of-way, parks,
trails, or open spaces, to provide for the dedication of land and streets
deemed necessary for the proper development of the subdivision, and to provide
for easements or rights-of-way that are necessary to service the properties
created by the subdivision.
(Ord. 2024-01, 2-1-2024)
13.10A.020: SCOPE:
   A.   This Title is designed to set for he the process for obtaining
preliminary and final subdivision approvals as well as inform the Subdivider
and public of the requirements and conditions necessary to obtain approval of a
Subdivision. Because each parcel of real property has unique site/situational
characteristics (whether natural or man-made), there may be some aspects of
subdivision development that cannot easily be articulated. For this reason, it
is not possible to cover every possible contingency. Therefore, the
Administrative Land Use Authority has the authority to impose reasonable
conditions for the subdivision and development in addition to those expressly
required, provided that:
      1.   The conditions are not arbitrary or capricious;
      2.   The conditions do not conflict with any local, state, federal law.
   B.   This Title shall apply to lots or parcels where public rights of way
are dedicated, and public improvements and infrastructure are installed
regardless of whether the land is subdivided.

13.10A.070: PRELIMINARY AND FINAL SUBDIVISION APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   Initial Staff Review. To help expedite review of a development
proposal, prior to submitting an application for subdivision review, persons
interested in undertaking development may meet informally with members of the
Community Development Department to become acquainted with the substantive and
procedural requirements of this Title, applicable City Codes, and Holladay City
Standard Specifications.
   B.   Development Review Meeting. It is strongly recommended that the
applicant attend a pre-application meeting where the development proposal will
be reviewed by the Technical Review Committee . At the meeting, representatives
from various departments will provide initial feedback on the concept plan
along with copies, links, or instructions for accessing the applicable land use
regulations, a list of standards, and preliminary and final subdivision
application checklists.
   C.   Preliminary and Final Subdivision Application Review.
      1.   Complete Preliminary and Final Subdivision Applications Required.
         a.   A preliminary subdivision application will not be accepted until
staff has determined it is complete.

preliminary subdivision approval has been granted and staff has determined the
final subdivision application is complete and complies with the requirements of
this Chapter and preliminary subdivision approval.
      2.   Review Cycle. If the application is complete, the review cycle will
commence with City staff.
         a.   Upon submittal of a preliminary or final subdivision application
and supporting information the application shall be forwarded to the reviewing
departments and agencies who shall perform an initial review to verify that the
application, subdivision plans, and supporting information are complete and

review comments, identifying and explaining the applicant’s revisions and
reasons for declining to make revisions, if any. The applicant’s written
explanation shall be comprehensive and specific, including a response to each
requested revision or required correction. If an applicant fails to address a
review comment in the response, the review cycle is not complete and the
subsequent review cycle may not begin until all comments are addressed.
         d.   If needed, additional review cycles will commence when the
applicant resubmits revised application materials, plans, and supporting
information to the City. No further review cycles are needed if all departments
and agencies verify that the preliminary or final review standard is met as
described in Subsection (e) and (f) of this Section.
      3.   Failure to submit complete information will result in written
notification to the applicant that the review cannot proceed further until all
required, necessary, and requested information is submitted.
   D.   Preliminary Subdivision Review Approval.
      1.   Land Use Authority Designation. When the preliminary subdivision
plat has been determined to be complete and in compliance with all
requirements, the plat, together with all supporting information, will be
forwarded to the Planning Commission for review at a public meeting.

13.10A.090: IMPROVEMENTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE:
   A.   General Requirements: All improvements and infrastructure related to a
Subdivision shall be installed according to the requirements of the City Code
and the Public Works Standards. The Subdivider shall be responsible for
extending all utilities and improvements and infrastructure to the Subdivision
if they are not already adjacent to or on the site including curb, gutter, and
sidewalk on streets operated by the Utah Department of Transportation. When the
City is to take ownership of public infrastructure and improvements, the City
shall require the Subdivider to install such improvements in a manner that does
not cause excessive liability or maintenance costs for the City at the
convenience or advantage of the Subdivider.
   B.   Utilities Required: The following utilities are required to be provided
by the Subdivider to each lot:
      1.   Culinary Water. The water source shall be provided by applicable
water provider unless an alternative permanent source is approved by the City
Engineer and the Salt Lake County Health Department.
      2.   Sewer. The sewer service shall be provided by Mount Olympus
Improvement District through gravity collection lines. Public sewer lift
stations are generally not permitted.
         a.   Public sewer lift stations may be granted by exception by the
Administrative Land Use Authority and the City Engineer when a lift station is
deemed clearly preferable to the interest of the City and gravity sewer is not
feasible.
         b.   Where gravity sewer connections are greater than 500' in
distance, septic tanks may be grant upon review and approval of the Salt Lake
County Health Department
      3.   Land Drain. The land drain system must be installed in areas with
shallow groundwater. If basements are eliminated and the geotechnical report
can provide sufficient documentation that groundwater levels (including
historical) are deep enough to eliminate the need for the land drain system,
the Administrative Land Use Authority and the City Engineer may allow this
requirement to be waived.
      4.   Electrical Power. The electrical power will be provided by Rocky
Mountain Power (RMP), or their successors and all installations must follow RMP
Standards.
      5.   Natural Gas. The natural gas service will be provided by Dominion
Energy, or their successors, and all installations must follow Dominion Energy
Standards.
   C.   Storm Water: Storm water plans shall meet the requirements of the Title
17 of this code. The City Engineer shall determine the appropriate
implementation strategy for meeting the City’s storm water-related standards,
using the current Capital Facilities Plan as a guide; this may include
decisions regarding ownership and access to storm water ponds, and where and
how the water shall flow as part of the City’s overall storm water system.
   D.   Storm Drainage (Canals And Ditches):
      1.   No ditch or canal shall be approved as suitable for the use of storm
drainage water without the written permission of the appropriate ditch or canal
company or of the water users for such use. No ditch or canal shall be used for
stormwater unless adequately improved to handle such water as may be reasonably
expected to be conveyed through the canal or ditch including, irrigation water,
subdivision runoff water, and other water expected to reach such canal or
ditch. Any modification to an existing canal or ditch is also subject to the
review and approval of the city engineer. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
      2.   The subdivider shall work with irrigation, drainage or ditch
companies as to:
         a.   Methods of covering, realigning or eliminating ditches or canals
within or abutting the subdivision;
         b.   The size of pipe and culverts required; and
         c.   The responsibility for the periodic inspection, cleaning and
maintenance of such ditches, pipes and culverts. In cases where canals or
ditches cross public roads or proposed public roads, specifications and grades
for pipe or culvert must be approved by the community development department.
   E.   Canal, Ditch, Irrigation Certification Of Protection: No plats for
subdivision improvements shall be approved by the city unless a “certification
of protection of existing irrigation and storm drain facilities” has been
completed and submitted to the city.
   F.   Inspections: All improvements and infrastructure shall receive
inspections by the City Engineer and as necessary to verify conformance with
the City Code and the Public Works Standards. Failure to obtain the necessary
inspections shall result in a fine as outlined in this Title. Failure to obtain
the necessary inspections may also necessitate removal and re-installation of
the improvements and infrastructure at the Subdivider’s sole cost, as such
removal and re-installation are determined by the City Engineer.
   G.   Fee in lieu of Actual Improvements: Subdivisions adjacent to a rural
road or another road where the surrounding area is lacking public improvements
and infrastructure may request the option to pay a fee in lieu of constructing
the required improvements and infrastructure. The Administrative Land Use
Authority and City Engineer may also require payment of the fee in lieu to make
improvements as a part of a larger future project. An Agreement approving the
payment of the fee in lieu may be approved during the Preliminary Improvement
Plans Application phase by the Administrative Land Use Authority and City
Engineer. Fee in lieu Agreements should only be approved when it is
unreasonable or undesirable for the improvements and infrastructure to be
installed with the development. The Agreement should include:
      1.   A calculation of the cost of the improvements not being installed.
      2.   For areas where the future project date is known, inflation costs at
a maximum of 3% per year may be used up to the project year. For areas where
the future project date is not known, inflation costs may only be included at a
maximum of 3% per year for 5 years.
      3.   For areas where off-site improvements have already been constructed
and excess capacity exists that was paid for by the city, Subdividers may “buy
in” to the existing improvements to meet their requirements. A determination of
available excess capacity and cost will be evaluated by the City Engineer.

   A.   General Requirements:
      1.   Access. All lots shall be accessed by a fully improved city street
and shall meet the frontage requirements of the zone the subdivision is
located. It shall be the responsibility of the Subdivider to provide proper
road access to the Subdivision as required in the City Code, the Public Works
Standards. The mere existence of a public road or right-of-way to the proposed
Subdivision does not mean that adequate access exists. It shall be the
Subdivider’s responsibility to construct and dedicate all public roads required
by the City to provide access to the Subdivision.
      2.   Design Standards. All Subdivisions shall comply with the current
Standards for design, construction specifications and inspection of street

Subdivision plan may be required to provide connectivity among developments,
provide for public safety and emergency access, minimize public infrastructure
maintenance and liability, and align with the General Plan and adopted
transportation plans.
      3.   Required Ingress/Egress Access.
         a.   Developments where the number of residential building units
exceeds thirty (30) along a single street shall have a minimum of two (2)
ingress/egress routes which are two (2) fully improved City rights-of-way.

all existing single-family buildings and lots, empty building lots, and each
apartment unit located along a single road up to and including the nearest
intersection with two (2) existing means of ingress/egress.
         b.   A development that extends more than one thousand eight hundred
feet (1,800') from a connecting street must provide a second ingress/egress.
      4.   Exceptions. The Administrative Land Use Authority for the
Preliminary Subdivision Applications may waive these access requirements for
more than thirty (30) residential units with one point of improved ingress/
egress when unique topographic circumstances or “landlocked” (physically
restrained from other access points) from adjacent, existing developments
circumstances exist. A waiver of these regulations may require additional
development requirements to ensure public safety standards are met.
      5.   Private Rights-Of-Way. Private rights-of-way may be used for
development purposes in all zoning districts subject to the following
conditions:
         a.   Private rights-of-way shall be designed and built as per the City

development of a public trail infrastructure in accordance with said Plan.
      2.   Improvements. Trails shall be developed in accordance with
applicable AASHTO standards with sufficient width, and to safely accommodate
two-way bicycle and pedestrian traffic along the trail corridor. In absence of
applicable AASHTO standards, the Salt Lake County Trails Standards are hereby
adopted and applied.
         a.   The Administrative Land Use Authority, when feasible, may allow
the trail right-of-way to be a substitute for required sidewalk and park strip
area on one side of the street right-of-way dedicated within the Subdivision.
         b.   All trail improvements shall be dedicated to the City or an
agreed upon non-profit third party, for the operation and maintenance after
final acceptance.
   D.   Fencing:
      1.   Purpose. Provide increased safety from potential dangers due to
agricultural activities, water courses, high-speed traffic, and other potential
dangers or hazards by requiring a barrier between potentially incompatible land
uses.
      2.   Requirement. Fencing shall be required under the following
conditions:
         a.   Bordering Natural and Man-Made Waterways. A six foot (6') high

      5.   All remnants of land left over after subdividing, shall be attached
to adjacent lots or made part of the common area governed by a Community/
Homeowners Association, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. All
lands within the boundaries of the Subdivision shall be accounted for, either
as lots, right of way, or as remainder parcels.
      6.   Lots having double frontage shall not be approved except where
necessitated by topographic or other unusual conditions or where the lots are
adjacent to a road that does not permit direct access (exception: corner lots).
      7.   Contiguous parcels owned by different parties may be joined into one
final plat, provided that all Owners join in the dedication and
acknowledgments.
      8.   A lot shall not be divided by a city limit or county limit line.
Such boundary lines shall be made at lot lines.
      9.   Undevelopable Parcels: Plats may designate lots which are designated

chapter 13.04 of this title for the purpose of subdivision are shown on chart
13.14.041 of this section, except that portions of a lot less than one-half (1/
2) the minimum lot width may not be counted toward the minimum lot area.
   C.   For lots fronting on a cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage shall be
measured at a distance thirty feet (30') from the front lot line and shall be
seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum lot width required by chart 13.14.041
of this section. (Ord. 2018-05, 5-17-2018)
13.14.050: SETBACKS:
   A.   Purpose: The spacing of buildings and structures away from property
lines, rights-of-way, physical hazards and natural features such as streams and
other buildings, are essential elements of land use planning and of urban
design. In particular, setbacks may provide for privacy, light, shadow, air
movement, passive and active space, vegetation and also contribute directly to
physical and psychological well being. Setbacks should vary proportionally
depending upon the size and shape of the properties and also upon the type of
the existing and proposed land use. In some instances setbacks should be
uniform assuming there is a specific desired outcome for the setback, such as
protection of views, public safety, economic development, etc. In other
instances, variability and flexibility of setback may produce equally important
outcomes such as the protection of natural features, aesthetically pleasing
streetscapes, creativity in architectural design, and retention of fragile
housing stock or other important goals. Due to the evolution of housing styles
over the last few decades, the relative high value of land within the
community, the desire for architectural creativity, and especially the dramatic
increase in average house size, setbacks shall be applied within a flexible
envelope.
   B.   Implementation: Averaging of setbacks in all yard areas shall be
allowed as shown below. Variations across the setback line may not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the minimums required. Calculation of the average
shall require at least ten (10) equally spaced measurements across any one
"building line", as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title, and shown in
figure 13.14.051 of this subsection.

13.14.054: FRONT SETBACKS:
   A.   Purpose: In the City of Holladay, development patterns have been set in
neighborhoods by past choices. These choices are reflected in the location of
homes with regard to the configuration of individual lots, the age of the
houses and the mature vegetation that has been cultivated and added over the
years. In order to maintain the unique character of individual neighborhoods,
the minimum front setback for main buildings on each street should support and
continue that development pattern.
   B.   Worksheet Required: The property owner and/or their designee shall
calculate the front yard setback as described herein. Results shall be
documented by completing the "R-1 Zone Worksheet", on file with the Community
Development Department. The completed worksheet shall be signed and submitted
with the building permit application and reviewed and verified by the Technical
Review Committee as per subsection
13.08.010A of this title, to become part of the permit file.
   C.   Front Setbacks On Lots 1.5 Acres In Size Or Larger: The minimum front
setback for any main building with frontage on a public street shall be forty
feet (40').
   D.   Front Setbacks On Lots Less Than 1.5 Acres: The minimum front setback
for any main building with frontage on a public street shall be calculated
using an average of the front setbacks of each of the main structures on the
block face within four (4) adjacent lots, two (2) on each side of the property
in question and may include the existing structure on the property in question.
The average of each main structure shall be determined on-site by using the
shortest and farthest measurement from the property line to the main structure.
Measurements will be verified by the Technical Review Committee. The average
calculation shall be further limited by the following:
      1.   If one or more of the lots required in the averaging calculations is
vacant, the front setback for such vacant lots will be determined based upon
the average front setback of the main building, if any, that formerly occupied
that lot. If the lot has never been occupied, or if the average front setback
of the former building cannot be determined, the front setback shall be
calculated using a fifth adjacent lot, which the Community Development Director
determines would most appropriately reflect the development pattern of the
neighborhood in question.
      2.   Lots fronting on a different street than the subject lot may not be
used in computing the average.
      3.   Lots, on file, with the Community Development Department, for which
a front yard variance has been granted by the City of Holladay Appeal Hearings
Officer are deemed to be unique to the streetscape and shall not be used in
computing the average. In which case the calculation of such lots shall be
based upon what the correct setback should have been, omitting the granted
variance distance.
      4.   If one or more of the lots required in the averaging calculations
have been built or rebuilt upon during or after August 2012, the Community
Development staff shall gather the information necessary to complete an "R-
1 Zone Worksheet" as described in subsection B of this section. If the
Community Development staff determines, based upon the information provided in
that worksheet, that the front yard setback for a building was calculated
incorrectly, or that the building was built incorrectly; the front yard setback
for such lots will be calculated based upon what the correct setback should
have been, rather than its as-built configuration.
      5.   When the subject lot is a corner lot, the average setback will be
computed on the basis of the three (3) adjacent lots on the same street as the
subject lot.
   E.   Front Setbacks On Private Rights-Of-Way: The minimum front setback for
a main building fronting on a private right-of-way is shown on chart 13.14.055
of this subsection.

13.14.056: SIDE SETBACKS:
   A.   The combined setbacks for any main structure on a lot in any R-1 zone
shall be a minimum of twenty five percent (25%) of the "lot width" (see
chapter 13.04, "Definitions", of this title) with no one side setback less than
ten percent (10%) of the lot width.
   B.   The combined setback for any main structure on a lot measuring twice or
more the minimum lot size required by the zone in which it is located shall be
a minimum thirty percent (30%) of the "lot width" (see
chapter 13.04, "Definitions", of this title) with no one side setback less than
fifteen percent (15%) of the lot width. (Ord. 2018-05, 5-17-2018)
13.14.057: CORNER SIDE SETBACKS:
The minimum corner side setback for any main structure on a public street,
private road or private lane shall be twenty feet (20'). (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-
2012)
13.14.060: SETBACKS ON PRIVATE DRIVEWAYS:
For the purpose of this title, lots fronting on a private driveway shall be
deemed as unique from lots on any other street, private road or private lane
and shall have setbacks as follows:
   A.   The minimum setback for any main building on a lot fronting on a
"private driveway" (see
chapter 13.04, "Definitions", of this title) shall be as follows:
      1.   A yard abutting the rear yard of an abutting lot shall maintain the
minimum rear setback required by section
13.14.052 of this chapter; and
      2.   A yard abutting the side yard of an abutting lot shall maintain the
minimum side setback required by section
13.14.056 of this chapter. On lots where only one side yard is required, the
minimum side setback shall be ten percent (10%) of the lot width. (Ord. 2015-
02, 2-5-2015)
13.14.065: SETBACKS ON DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS:
   A.   Lots with frontage on two (2) public streets shall be required to
provide two (2) front setbacks as required by subsection
13.14.054D of this chapter, except as follows:
      1.   For lots with frontage on I-215 or Vanwinkle Expressway, those
frontages shall be considered as rear lot lines and shall comply with section
13.14.052 of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.14.070: BUILDING HEIGHT:
   A.   Purpose: Limiting overall building height and building height in
relation to the property line (i.e., graduated height), is an essential element
of land use planning and urban design. In particular, height limitations
provide some view protection, light, shadow, air movement, and also contribute
directly to physical and psychological well being. The use of overall height
limitations proportional to the lot sizes, and of a graduated height envelope,
is intended to keep the massing of structures away from the property line,
lessening the impact of new homes on abutting lots while allowing for and
encouraging architectural interest. In addition to meeting all of the maximum
height and graduated height envelopes required in this chapter, architects,
developers, and homeowners are required to break up large wall and gable areas
with articulations, building relief, and appropriate fenestration, among other
ornamental features.
   B.   Implementation: Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
title, no building or structure shall exceed the following height:
      1.   Main Buildings:
         a.   In all residential zones, the maximum height of any main
building/structure located within the building corridor area as provided in
section
13.14.071 of this chapter shall be as shown on chart 13.14.070 of this
subsection.
CHART 13.14.070
 
Lot Area In Square Feet Maximum Height In Feet
Less than 15,000        32
15,001 to 1 acre        35
Over 1 acre             40
 
         b.   Upon application of a building permit of a main building proposed
upon a new parcel the recording of which resulted from the consolidation of two
(2) or more parcel(s), the maximum height shall be determined by using the area
of largest parcel prior to the recorded consolidation, as provided in chart
13.14.070 of this section. (Ord. 2018-05, 5-17-2018)
      2.   Graduated Height: The height of all buildings/structures, main and
accessory, is further limited by the graduated height envelope created by
starting at a point on the property line eight feet (8') above ground and then
sloping a line at a forty five degree (45°) angle toward the center of the lot.
The entire building must fit under this line except for:
         a.   Dormers that exceed the graduated height envelope:
            (1)   Are limited to fourteen feet (14') wide maximum;
            (2)   Must have at least one-half (1/2) of the dormer width between
each dormer, and from each dormer to the front and side edges of the roof;
            (3)   May not extend above the ridge of the roof it is on.
         b.   Gable, vertical wall, parapet or other structural elements that
exceed the graduated height envelope:
            (1)   Where the graduated height envelope intersects a gable, the
gable may not exceed 0.75 times higher than the point where the graduated
height envelope intersects the gable or "x" (1.75) = maximum gable height. See
figure 1 of this subsection.

            (2)   Where the graduated height envelope intersects a vertical
wall, parapet or structural element other than a gable, the height may not
exceed 0.40 times higher than the point where the graduated height envelope
intersects the vertical wall, parapet or other structural element, or "x"
(1.40) = maximum overall height. See figure 2 of this subsection.

(Where "x" is the height from natural grade at which the graduated height plane
intersects the gable.)
            (3)   May not exceed the overall height allowance.
      3.   Exceptions:
         a.   For structures in the R-1 Zones, chimneys, and other minor
architectural features as defined in
chapter 13.04 of this title, may be erected a maximum six feet (6') above the
height limits prescribed in section
13.14.071 of this chapter.
         b.   Individual building elevations that face a public street, or abut
a public or quasi-public, or other nonresidential use are exempt from the
graduated height requirements of this section. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.14.071: BUILDING CORRIDOR:
   A.   Purpose: The building corridor is a three-dimensional regulation
limiting the depth of a new residential construction at the maximum height
allowed. (Ord. 2012-23, 10-11-2012)
   B.   Determination: The building corridor of a main structure shall be
determined by comparing only similarly sized lots on the same block face as the
subject property.
      1.   Where the subject property is 1.5 acres in size or larger, the
determination of the building corridor shall only involve other lots that are
1.5 acres or larger.
      2.   Where the subject property is smaller than 1.5 acres in size, the
determination of the building corridor shall only involve other lots that are
smaller than 1.5 acres.
      3.   If there are no comparable lots, as applicable, within the
comparative building corridor area, the Community Development Director shall
determine the appropriate building corridor for a new home, with written
findings, based upon what is most compatible with the other existing homes on
adjacent lots within the immediate area. (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
   C.   Interior Lots: The calculation of the building corridor for any main
structure shall be further determined by averaging the depths of each main
structure, front to back, on the similarly sized lots as categorized in
subsection B of this section.
      1.   For any home(s) built or remodeled pursuant to a building permit
issued prior to November 30, 1999, the applicable building corridor shall be
calculated at 1.15 times the averaged depth of that home(s).
      2.   For any home(s) built or remodeled pursuant to a building permit
issued on or after November 30, 1999, the applicable building corridor shall be
calculated at 1.0 times the averaged depth of only that portion of the
structure that exceeds twenty feet (20') in height.
   D.   Corner Lots: On corner lots, the building corridor for a main structure
shall be calculated as set forth above, except that for any home which was
built pursuant to a building permit issued prior to November 30, 1999, the
applicable building corridor shall be calculated at 1.2 times the averaged
depth of that home(s).
   E.   Implementation: Application of the calculated building corridor depth
shall be implemented by beginning from the determined front setback line as
described in subsection
13.14.054D of this chapter.
   F.   Transition: The building corridor shall be extended by a one to one (1:
1) slope from the maximum height allowed in subsection
13.14.070B1a, chart 13.14.070 of this chapter down to the height limitation as
outlined in subsection G of this section.
   G.   Height Limitation: On public streets, private roads or private lanes as
defined in
chapter 13.04 of this title, any portion of a main building/structure extending
behind the building corridor area shall not exceed twenty feet (20') in height.
   H.   Slope: On property where the slope of the original ground surface
exceeds fifteen percent (15%), the maximum height of any main structure shall
not exceed thirty feet (30'). The slope shall be determined using a line drawn
from the highest point of elevation to the lowest point of elevation on the
perimeter of a box encircling the foundation line of the building or structure.
Said box shall extend for a distance of fifteen feet (15') or to the property
line, whichever is less, around the foundation line of the building or
structure. The elevation shall be determined using a certified topographic
survey with a maximum contour interval of two feet (2').
   I.   Required: No dwelling unit shall contain less than one story. (Ord.
2012-23, 10-11-2012)
13.14.080: LOT COVERAGE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to regulate the installation of
impervious surfaces within the city of Holladay. It is the intent of this
regulation to be sensitive to the natural and built environment. The city's
intent is to support reasonable land use regulations. Some of the tools that
can be used in this regard are included elsewhere in this title and also
outlined below. The restriction of impervious surfaces can have a positive
effect on the overall environment. Impervious surfaces replace and alter the
natural landscape. Their construction can initiate a chain of events that
modifies water resources, urban air elements, and the overall environment.
Findings supporting this regulation are:
      1.   Impervious surfaces seal the soil surface, eliminating the benefits
of rainwater filtration and natural groundwater recharge. Stormwaters run
across impervious surfaces, collecting toxins and debris which may be damaging
to the health of riparian habitats and to all waterways and lakes.
      2.   Excessive storm drainage created by uncontrolled runoff often
negatively impacts private property and public infrastructure.
      3.   Impervious surfaces damage tree roots systems depriving them of
water which in turn destroys the canopy and shade that would otherwise moderate
excessively hot urban climates known as "heat islands". Impervious surfaces
displace living vegetation, which is necessary for normal atmospheric carbon
cycling.
      4.   The loss of urban forests, especially in arid Utah and particularly
in Holladay, which is well known for its spectacular tree cover, results in a
loss of community identity and reduces property values.
      5.   In areas of urban build out, redevelopment and reconstruction are
opportunities for environmental rehabilitation. Permeable or porous paving is
an important component in low impact development.
   B.   Maximum Lot Coverage: The total allowable lot coverage for all
structures and the total impervious coverage for any lot is shown on chart
13.14.080B of this section, excluding outdoor swimming pools, ponds with
artificial liners and other water features. Approved permeable or porous
surfaces may be allowed per coverage bonus

13.14.090: COVERAGE OF REAR YARD:
No accessory building, including a guesthouse or group of accessory buildings,
shall cover more than twenty five percent (25%) of the rear yard. (Ord. 2012-
15, 9-20-2012)
13.14.100: MASS AND SCALE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is not to restrict architectural
freedom but address the appropriate size of a structure given its context
within an established neighborhood. Two (2) factors influence the perception of
mass and scale of a structure: the physical relationship of the structure to
the size of the adjacent structures and the physical distance between
structures.
   B.   Limitation: To avoid any large, continuous building mass of uniform
height, no portion of any building shall continue more than forty feet (40')
horizontally without a minimum of an eighteen inch (18") break in the roofline
and/or an articulated architectural element such as overhangs, projections,
insets, material and textural changes, or other architectural elements used to
create shadow patterns along the elevation of the building.
   C.   Second Story Locations: Second story portions of a building shall be
designed with adjacent structures in mind. Reduction in the overall scale of
the building can be accomplished by the use of varied upper story setbacks,
providing significantly larger setbacks for the entire structure and/or
placement of the major portion of the second story over the rear portion of the
first story.

   D.   Exposed Vertical Wall Surfaces Within The Building Corridor:
      1.   Lots where topography slopes from one property line to another may
increase the height of an exposed wall when measured from the natural or
finished grade of the downhill side, whichever is lowest, to a maximum wall

13.32.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide areas for residential developments
with opportunities for alternative housing in either attached or detached
construction arrangements. Furthermore, the standards set forth in this chapter
should support the goals of the general plan in particular, the encouragement
of medium density housing in areas of the city near collector and major
arterial streets as a transition between established single- family
neighborhoods and other nonresidential uses. These regulations promote
clustered developments by the use of graduated height, building envelope rules,
maximum lot coverage, landscaping regulations and setback averaging, thereby
conserving open space and views where it is consistent with surrounding
neighborhoods. Recognizing that as individuals and families move from one stage
of life to the next, providing a range of housing choices allows them the
opportunity to live in housing that suits their needs and desires while
allowing them to maintain their neighborhood and community bonds. (Ord. 2012-
15, 9-20-2012)
13.32.020: TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONE, R-2-8:

   B.   Combined Uses: Any combination of uses may be established within the
same building or on the same lot or parcel. If any of the proposed uses is a
conditional use, that use shall be reviewed and approved by the planning
commission as required by section
13.08.040 of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.32.060: ACCESSORY USES:
Permitted and conditional uses set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title shall be deemed to
include accessory uses and activities that are necessarily and customarily
associated with and incidental and subordinate to such primary uses allowed by
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title.
   A.   Accessory uses shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to
permitted and conditional uses in the zone except as otherwise expressly
provided in this title.
   B.   No accessory use, building or structure shall be allowed on a lot or
parcel unless a primary permitted or conditional use is currently established
on the parcel, except as allowed by section
13.09.020 of this title.
   C.   Specific accessory uses allowed in the Multiple-Family Residential (R-
2 and R-M) Zones are as set forth in

(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.32.080: SETBACK REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The spacing of buildings and structures away from property
lines, rights-of-way, physical hazards and natural features such as streams and
other buildings, are essential elements of land use planning and of urban
design. In particular, setbacks may provide for privacy, light, shadow, air
movement, passive and active space, vegetation and also contribute directly to
physical and psychological well being. Setbacks should vary proportionally
depending upon the size and shape of the properties and also upon the type of
the existing and proposed land use. In some instances setbacks should be
uniform assuming there is a specific desired outcome for the setback, such as
protection of views, public safety, economic development, etc. In other
instances, variability and flexibility of setback may produce equally important
outcomes such as the protection of natural features, aesthetically pleasing
streetscapes, creativity in architectural design, and retention of fragile
housing stock or other important goals. Due to the evolution of housing styles
over the last few decades, the relative high value of land within the
community, the desire for architectural creativity, and especially the dramatic
increase in average house size, setbacks shall be applied within a flexible
envelope. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
   B.   Implementation: Averaging of setbacks in all yard areas shall be
allowed as shown below. Variations across the setback line may not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the minimums required. Calculation of the average
shall require at least ten (10) equally spaced measurements across any one
"building line", as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title, and shown in figure 13.32.081 of this subsection. The
minimum setback requirements for a main building are shown on
table 13.32.081 of this subsection. (Ord. 2019-03, 2-28-2019)

13.32.090: BUILDING HEIGHT:
   A.   Purpose: Limiting overall building height and building height in
relation to the property line (i.e., graduated height), is an essential element
of land use planning and of urban design. In particular, height limitations
provide for some territorial view protection, light, shadow, air movement, and
also contribute directly to physical and psychological well being. The use of
overall height limitations proportional to the lot sizes, and of a graduated
height envelope, is intended to keep the massing of structures away from the
property line, lessening the impact of new homes on abutting lots while
allowing for and encouraging architectural interest. In addition to meeting all
of the maximum height and graduated height envelopes required in this chapter,
architects, developers, and homeowners are strongly encouraged to break up
large wall and gable areas with articulations, building relief, and appropriate
fenestration, among other ornamental features. (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
   B.   Implementation:
      1.   Main Buildings:
         a.   In all R-2 and R-M Zones, the maximum height of any main
building/structure is as shown on
table 13.32.091 of this subsection.
TABLE 13.32.091
 
Lot Area In Square Feet Maximum Height In Feet
Up to 15,000            32
15,001 to 1 acre        35
Greater than 1 acre     40
 
         b.   On property where the slope of the original ground surface
exceeds fifteen percent (15%), the maximum height of any main structure shall
not exceed thirty feet (30'), nor exceed the allowable height as shown in
subsection B1a,
table 13.32.091 of this section. The slope shall be determined using a line
drawn from the highest point of elevation to the lowest point of elevation on
the perimeter of a box encircling the foundation line of the building or
structure. Said box shall extend for a distance of fifteen feet (15') or to the
property line, whichever is less, around the foundation line of the building or
structure. The elevation shall be determined using a certified topographic
survey with a maximum contour interval of two feet (2').
         c.   No dwelling shall contain less than one story.
      2.   Graduated Height: The height of all buildings/structures, main and
accessory, are further limited by the graduated height envelope created by
starting at a point on the property line eight feet (8') aboveground and then
sloping a line at a forty five degree (45°) angle toward the center of the lot.
The entire building must fit under this line except for:
         a.   Dormers that exceed the graduated height envelope:
            (1)   Are limited to fourteen feet (14') wide maximum;
            (2)   Must have at least one-half (1/2) of the dormer width between
each dormer, and from each dormer to the front and side edges of the roof;
            (3)   May not extend above the ridge of the roof it is on.
         b.   Gables that exceed the graduated height envelope:
            (1)   May not be more than 1.75 times higher than the point where
the graduated height envelope intersects the gable;
            (2)   May not exceed the overall height allowance.
      3.   Accessory Buildings/Structures: The maximum height of any accessory
building/structure shall be twenty feet (20'). (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.32.100: COVERAGE REGULATIONS:
The maximum lot coverage of impervious surface area on a lot in the Multi-
Family Zones is sixty percent (60%). (Ord. 2019-03, 2-28-2019)
13.32.110: LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS:
All uses in the R-2-8, R-2-10 and R-M Zones shall comply with the provisions
governing landscaping and buffering in
chapter 13.77 of this title. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013)
13.32.120: ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS:
   A.   Access shall be provided by a private street or right-of-way from a
public street, such private street or right-of-way shall have a travel width of
at least twenty feet (20') wide. A minimum of two (2) parking spaces shall be
provided for each dwelling unit. A minimum of 0.5 parking spaces shall be
provided for guest parking for each dwelling unit.
   B.   Opaque fences shall be provided along all interior property lines
unless the Planning Commission approves otherwise.
   C.   No fence, wall or hedge shall be erected to a height exceeding four
feet (4') in the front yard and six feet (6') in the side and rear yards unless
approved by the Planning Commission as a conditional use pursuant to the
provisions of section
13.08.040 of this title.
   D.   No parking areas may be located within the required front setback from
a public street.
   E.   All trash receptacles shall be enclosed by sight obscuring fencing
appropriate to the architecture of the main structures. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-

13.45.010: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
The purpose of the O-R-D Zone is to provide an aesthetically attractive
environment where flexibility in the land use mix can be fostered. The primary
intent of the zone is to establish a specific area where more intensive office,
research and development facilities can be located. However, the complexity of
the land in the zone and its adjacency to a major freeway access supports the
incorporation of subordinate, and compatible multi-family residential and
general commercial activity such as travel and tourism related uses. Retail,
service, convenience and food establishments are considered appropriate for the
zone when developed with proper site plan and architectural design guidelines.
The zone is intended to ensure compatibility of new development with the
surrounding land uses, including adjacent residential developments, and to
enhance and support the overall economic health and housing needs of the City.

13.50.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the residential office zone (RO) is to allow for the reuse of
those properties which have frontage on busy streets only where residential use
is no longer economically feasible. This zone is intended as a transition
between established residential neighborhoods and the existing commercial
developments along these corridors. RO rezone applications must establish a
clear justification for implementation of this zone over other land use
alternatives for the property in question and the general vicinity.
Primarily, the RO zone standards are designed to preserve existing housing
stock by allowing the conversion of residential properties to such
nonresidential uses that have less impact on the surrounding properties than
typical commercial uses. The conversion of a single-family home to a small
professional office or other nonresidential use is a less intrusive type of
development when compared to new construction and is better able to maintain
the existing residential character of the streetscape. While, new construction
is potentially allowed in the RO zone, it should be the exception, not the
rule, and new structures and uses within this zone must be compatible in scale
and character with surrounding residential development. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-
2014)
13.50.020: RESIDENTIAL OFFICE ZONE (RO) ESTABLISHED:
The following zone is established:
   A.   Residential Office Zone (RO): The purpose of the RO zone is to set
standards for areas where restricted and limited, small scale, nonretail, low
impact office uses are allowed adjacent to residential areas.
   B.   Rezone Requests: In evaluating any rezone application for this zone,
preference shall be given to those properties which:
      1.   Have frontage on Highland Drive, Murray Holladay Road (west of 2300
East) or 1300 East.
      2.   Occur within a general plan district of either professional office,
office/residential, commercial, or are within the Highland Drive master plan
area, and
      3.   Will result in an upgrade of the building and/or site.
   C.   Use And Site Plan Approvals: Conditional use permits and site plan
approvals for developments in the RO zone shall be made by the planning
commission as allowed by sections
13.08.040 and
13.08.080 of this title. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-2014)
13.50.030: PRIMARY USES:
   A.   Permitted And Conditional Uses: The permitted and conditional uses
allowed in residential office zone (RO) shall be as set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title. Any primary land
use not shown as a permitted or conditional use in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title shall be prohibited.
   B.   Combined Uses: Any combination of uses may be established within the
same building or on the same lot or parcel. If any of the proposed uses is a
conditional use, that use shall be reviewed and approved by the planning
commission as required by section
13.08.040 of this title. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-2014)
13.50.040: ACCESSORY USES:
Permitted and conditional uses set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title shall be deemed to
include accessory uses and activities that are necessarily and customarily
associated with and incidental and subordinate to such primary uses allowed by
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title.
   A.   Accessory uses shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to
permitted and conditional uses in the zone except as otherwise expressly
provided in this title.
   B.   No accessory use, building or structure shall be allowed on a lot or
parcel unless a primary permitted or conditional use is currently established
on the parcel, except as allowed by section
13.09.020 of this title.
   C.   Specific accessory uses allowed in the residential office zone (RO) are
as set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title.
   D.   Accessory uses and buildings customarily incidental to a permitted or
conditional use may be allowed in the residential office zone (RO), provided
the total footprint square footage of all accessory buildings does not exceed
the maximum square footage as allowed in section
13.14.110 of this title. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-2014)
13.50.050: GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Development standards in the RO zone shall be as follows:
TABLE 13.50.051
 
Standard
Lot area                            No minimum
Lot width                           No minimum
Lot frontage                        No minimum
Maximum impervious surface coverage 60 percent1
Maximum aboveground square feet     New construction - 3,500 per main building
                                    Existing structures - no limit
 
Note:
1.    The total percent impervious coverage may be increased through the use of
approved permeable or porous surfaces no more than an additional 10 percent as
allowed in subsection
13.14.080C of this title.
   B.   Development of lots on a private driveway (flag lot), as defined by
section
13.04.040 of this code, is prohibited in the RO zone. No intervening
development between the street and any main building on a lot in the RO zone

(Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-2014)
13.50.060: SETBACKS:
   A.   Purpose: The spacing of buildings and structures away from property
lines and rights of way play an important part in the look and feel of a
neighborhood. The residential office zone (RO) standards are intended to allow
small nonresidential development along busy streets while maintaining the look
and feel of the street's original residential character. Setbacks should be
influenced by compatibility with the surrounding residential uses while
allowing flexibility for requirements associated with nonresidential
development such as parking, security lighting and trash disposal. As with the
residential zones, setbacks should vary proportionally depending upon the size
and shape of the properties and also upon the type of the existing and proposed
land use. In some instances setbacks should be uniform assuming there is a
specific desired outcome for the setback, such as protection of views, public
safety, economic development, etc. In other instances, variability and
flexibility of setback may produce equally important outcomes such as the
protection of natural features, aesthetically pleasing streetscapes, creativity
in architectural design, and retention of fragile housing stock or other
important goals.
   B.   Implementation: Averaging of setbacks in all yard areas shall be
allowed. Variations across the setback line may not exceed fifteen percent
(15%) of the minimums required. Calculation of the average shall require at
least ten (10) equally spaced measurements across any one "building line", as
defined in section
13.04.040 of this title, and shown in section
13.14.050,
figure 13.14.051 of this title.
   C.   Setbacks: Setbacks for new structures within the RO zone shall be as
shown on
table 13.50.061 of this section.

13.50.180: REVIEW BY THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD:
   A.   Application: The conceptual design of any application for development
located in the RO zone which requires approval by the planning commission shall
be reviewed by the DRB as provided in this section.
   B.   Scope: A DRB review and recommendation is required for the following
development in the RO zone:
      1.   All new building construction;
      2.   Any remodeling which increases the floor area of an existing
building; or
      3.   Any exterior remodeling, as defined by the international building
codes, of an existing main building.
   C.   Submissions: An application subject to design review shall include all
of the requirements of section
13.03.040H of this title.
   D.   Recommendation: The DRB shall review the proposed conceptual design
plan for compliance with the RO design guidelines set forth in section
13.50.190 of this chapter. At the conclusion of the review, the DRB shall make
a recommendation to the planning commission to accept the design concept as
submitted, provisionally accept the design concept subject to plan revisions
necessary to achieve compliance with the design guidelines, or continue design
concept for preparation of a new design concept if the concept is substantially
out of compliance with the design guidelines. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-2014)
13.50.190: DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is not to restrict architectural
freedom in new buildings, nor choose any one specific architectural style for
any particular property or street but to address the appropriate design, size
and scale of a structure given its context within the surrounding neighborhood.
Two (2) factors influence the perception of mass and scale of a structure: the
physical relationship of the structure to the size of the adjacent structures
and the physical distance between structures.
   B.   Limitation: To avoid any large, continuous building mass of uniform
height, no portion of any new building shall continue more than forty feet
(40') horizontally without a minimum of an eighteen inch (18") break in the
roofline and/or an articulated architectural element such as overhangs,
projections, insets, material and textural changes, or other architectural
elements used to create shadow patterns along the elevation of the building.
The maximum length of any blank wall uninterrupted by windows, doors or
architectural detailing at the first floor level shall be fifteen feet (15').
   C.   Second Story Locations: Second story portions of a building shall be
designed with adjacent structures in mind. Reduction in the overall scale of
the building can be accomplished by the use of varied upper story setbacks,
providing significantly larger setbacks for the entire structure and/or
placement of the major portion of the second story over the rear portion of the
first story.
   D.   Facade Embellishment: Any building wall visible from a public right of
way shall incorporate architectural design embellishments which are compatible
with other publicly visible parts of the building. Embellishments dividing the
facade visually may include windows, a recessed entrance or other appropriate
variations as approved by the DRB.
   E.   Window And Door Designs: Windows and doors shall be used to define the
character of buildings by giving scale to the building and providing visual
interest to the composition of individual facades. Distinct window and door
designs should be used to help define building styles. There must be provided
at least one operable building entrance per elevation that faces a public
street.
   F.   Awnings And Canopies: Awnings and canopies should contribute to the
architectural theme and shall be integrated within the building design. Awnings
should be constructed of traditional materials and located over windows and
doors. Backlit awnings are prohibited.
   G.   Building Materials: Building exteriors shall be constructed from high
quality and durable materials. It is important that the materials and colors
will weather well and need minimal maintenance.
      1.   Acceptable exterior finish materials include the following:
         a.   Painted, stained or weathered wood siding such as, 4-S shingles,
board and batten and clapboard;
         b.   Artificial wood siding such as painted cementitious fiberboard;
         c.   Brick or natural stone;
         d.   EIFS (synthetic stucco) (not more than 50 percent of all exterior
finished surfaces);
         e.   Stucco;
         f.   Synthetic stone; and
         g.   Architectural finish or decorative faced concrete masonry units
(CMUs).
      2.   Materials not listed above shall be prohibited unless determined to
be part of a strong architectural design theme as approved by the planning
commission after review by the DRB.
   H.   Roofs: The character of a roof is a major feature for a structure. The
roof pitch, its materials, size and orientation are all distinct features that
should contribute to the residential character of the building. Shadows created
by traditional overhangs should contribute to the perception of a building's
scale. Roof designs should relate to the building facade articulations.
Roof materials should be in keeping with the character of the architectural
style of the building. Recommended roof materials include slate shingles,
asphalt and fiberglass shingles, metal standing seam or tiles. Crickets or
other snow guard devices should be placed in such a way that does not alter the
form of the roof as seen from the street.
   I.   Remodeling Or Additions: Remodeling or additions to residential
buildings shall be allowed only if the residential character of the exterior is
maintained. Building additions shall consist of materials, color and exterior
building design consistent with the existing structure. (Ord. 2014-05, 4-17-

standards for areas where restricted and limited, small scale, low impact
commercial uses are allowed adjacent to residential areas. The implementation
of the NC zone is intended to be on a very limited basis and only on properties
where the existing impacts of traffic, noise or other impacts make the property
marginal for continued low density residential uses.
In evaluating any application for this zone, attention shall be given to safe
and inviting pedestrian access from the surrounding neighborhood, current and
projected traffic impacts, parking needs, past and present use of the site,
abutting uses, hours of operation, historic significance of the property, and
reuse versus redevelopment of the site. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.55.030: SITE PLAN REVIEW:
All site plans for new, modified or expanded development projects in the NC
zone shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission as allowed by
sections

13.55.040: PRIMARY USES:
   A.   Permitted and conditional primary uses allowed in the NC zone shall be
as set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title. Uses not included
in the table are not permitted.
   B.   Any combination of uses may be established within the same building or
on the same lot or parcel. If any of the proposed uses is a conditional use,
the entire project shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.55.050: ACCESSORY USES:
Permitted and conditional uses set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title shall be deemed to
include accessory uses and activities that are necessarily and customarily
associated with and incidental and subordinate to such uses. Uses not included
in the table are not permitted. Second floor single-family residential shall be
deemed as a permitted use.
   A.   Accessory uses shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to
permitted and conditional uses in the zone except as otherwise expressly
provided in this title.
   B.   No accessory use, building or structure shall be allowed on a lot or
parcel unless a primary permitted or conditional use is currently established
on the parcel, except as allowed by section
13.09.020 of this title.
   C.   Specific accessory uses allowed in the NC zone are as set forth in
chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-

   F.   Lighting: It is the intent of this subsection to encourage lighting
practices and systems that minimize light pollution, glare and light trespass,
conserve energy and resources, and maintain nighttime safety and utility while
ensuring the enjoyment of a starry night for all members of the community. The
standards in this subsection require the proposed lighting systems to be of the
absolute minimum needed for safety and utility of the site, per Illumination
Engineering Society standards of North America.
In addition to the general provisions of this subsection, all site lighting
shall be shielded and/or directed in such a manner that it illuminates only the
user's premises and does not spill over into neighboring residential areas so
as to interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of residential or public
properties. Foot-candles at the property line shall not exceed 0.1. Foot-
candles shall not exceed 0.01 at ten feet (10') from the commercial property
line as measured on the residential side. Except as provided herein, or unless
otherwise explicitly approved by the planning commission, the light source
shall be a full cutoff fixture, completely concealed within an opaque housing.
All exterior lighting fixtures designed or placed so as to illuminate any
portion of a site shall meet the following requirements:

15, 9-20-2012)
   G.   Landscaping: All uses in the NC zone shall comply with the provisions
governing landscaping and buffering in
chapter 13.77 of this title. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013)
   H.   Perimeter Wall:
      1.   The project area shall have a decorative tinted concrete or masonry
wall along all rear and side yards not fronting on a public street, but which
abut a residential zone or a residential use.
      2.   This requirement may be waived by the planning commission upon a
determination that the wall is not necessary to buffer the abutting use. Such
walls shall not be located in the required setback from a public street.
      3.   All perimeter walls shall be a minimum of six feet (6') high unless
the planning commission requires a higher wall as part of the site plan
approval.
   I.   Public Improvements:
      1.   The developer of the project shall be responsible for the dedication
and improvement of all off site public improvements that do not presently exist
according to the width of the ultimate right of way, as called out in the
roadway classification map of the Holladay City general plan, on or along the
property being developed. If a property has multiple street frontages,
improvements are required along all streets. Such improvements shall include,
but are not limited to: curb, gutter, sidewalk, streetlights, drive approaches,
waterways, road base, asphalt, striping, streetscape, storm drainage, fire
hydrants, laterals, piping of irrigation ditches and flood control systems,
fencing of canals, extension of water lines, appurtenances and sewer lines,
removal of utility lines out of the right of way (with the exception of
traditionally buried lines such as sewer, water, and natural gas transmission
lines), etc.
      2.   All required improvements shall be designed and installed by the
developer according to the Holladay City standard specifications for public
works construction and approved by the city engineer and city public works
director.
   J.   General Maintenance: Property (including all buildings, landscaping,
fences, walls, drives, parking lot surfacing and striping, signs, or other
structures) shall be maintained in good repair and in accordance with the
approved site plan for the project. Rights of way and pavements shall be kept
true to line and grade and in good repair. Drainage ditches shall be kept clean
and free of any obstructions.
   K.   Hazardous Activities: No land or building devoted to uses authorized by
this chapter shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create noxious or
objectionable fire, explosive or other hazards; noise or vibration, smoke,
dust, or other form of air pollution, heat, cold, dampness, glare, electrical
or other disturbance, liquid or solid refuse or waste, or other substance,
condition or element in such a manner or in such an amount as to adversely
affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises.
   L.   Signs: All signs in the NC zone shall comply with the regulations in
section
13.82.200, "Holladay Village Sign Regulations", of this title. (Ord. 2012-15,
9-20-2012)
13.55.080: DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes design guidelines intended to improve
the quality and compatibility of developments throughout the NC zone.
Guidelines that employ the word "should" are intended to be optional but
encouraged as stated. Guidelines using the word "shall" are mandatory.
   B.   Building Mass: To avoid any large, continuous building mass of uniform
height, no portion of any building shall continue for more than fifty feet
(50') horizontally along any street frontage without a vertical break in the
roofline. The required break in the building height shall continue for a
minimum of thirty feet (30') along the horizontal plane before continuation of
the original height.
      1.   Break In Roofline: A break in the roofline is defined as:
         a.   A ten foot (10') minimum step back of the vertical plane of the
building on one or more stories, or all stories; or
         b.   A reduction in the number of stories of the remainder of the
building.
      2.   Structural Articulation: The vertical planes of a building shall be
varied so that no continuous elevation is longer than fifty feet (50')
horizontally without a structural articulation which may include facade
modulation, structural expressions, varied setbacks or heights, textural
modulations and/or projections such as balconies, cornices, covered entrances,
arcades or colonnades or other architectural element dividing the facade
visually to provide relief to perceived building mass from the street
elevation.
   C.   Facade Embellishment: Any building wall visible from a public right of
way or from a public parking structure shall incorporate architectural design
embellishments which are compatible with other publicly visible parts of the
building. In addition, a contiguous building wall (longer than 50 feet) shall
have a building element, dividing the facade visually which may include
windows, a recessed entrance or other appropriate variations. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-
20-2012)
   D.   Reinforcement Of Design: Building design should reinforce the
building's location abutting the street edge. Buildings are encouraged to be
sited at or near the property line and larger setbacks are discouraged unless
they contribute to the pedestrian activity along the street. Buildings on
corner lots should be oriented to the corner. Corner entries and/or
architectural treatment should be used to emphasize the corner. At least one
active entrance shall face the public right of way. (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
   E.   Window And Door Designs: Windows and doors shall be used to define the
character of buildings by giving scale to the building and providing visual
interest to the composition of individual facades. Distinct window and door
designs should be used to help define building styles. Articulated, transparent
facades should be created along pedestrian rights of way, including display
windows as a link between pedestrians and activities in the building.
Windows on the second or third level should be vertically proportioned and the
design of surrounding window casing, the depth and profile of window sash
element, and the material of which they are constructed should be distinctly
associated with the specific building style.
   F.   Awnings And Canopies: Awnings and canopies should contribute to the
architectural theme and shall be integrated within the building design. Awnings
should be constructed of traditional materials and located over windows and
doors. Ornamental or architectural features, such as canopies, awnings,
balconies, cornices, etc., may be allowed to protrude into the right of way by
permission of the planning commission and the city manager subject to a license
agreement.
      1.   On multi-storefront buildings, separate awnings should be located
within each storefront opening so that the building frame and details are
revealed.
      2.   Retractable and fixed awnings are allowed no less than eight feet
(8') above the sidewalk.
      3.   Under awning lights that are designed to specifically illuminate the
sidewalk and storefront are permitted.
      4.   Backlit awnings are prohibited.
   G.   Building Materials: Building exteriors shall be constructed from high
quality and durable materials. It is important that the materials and colors
will weather well and need minimal maintenance.
      1.   Acceptable exterior finish materials include the following:
         a.   Painted, stained or weathered wood siding such as, 4-S shingles,
board and batten and clapboard;
         b.   Artificial wood siding such as painted cementious fiberboard;
         c.   Brick or natural stone;
         d.   EIFS (synthetic stucco) (not more than 50 percent of all exterior
finished surfaces);
         e.   Stucco;
         f.   Synthetic stone; and
         g.   Architectural finish or decorative faced concrete masonry units
(CMUs).
      2.   Materials not listed above shall be prohibited unless determined to
be part of a strong architectural design theme.
      3.   No portion of a building constructed of standard CMUs shall be
visible from an existing public right of way. Exposed concrete walls should be
architecturally treated. The enhancement must include joint treatments,
textured concrete such as exposed aggregate, sandblasted and/or colored
concrete, or other decorative finishes.
   H.   Roofs: The character of a roof is a major feature for a structure. The
roof pitch, its materials, size and orientation are all distinct features that
should contribute to the character of the building. Shadows created by
traditional overhangs should contribute to the perception of a building's
scale. Roof designs should relate to the building facade articulations.
      1.   A variety of roof types and configurations should be used to add
interest and reduce perceived building bulk.
      2.   Use of sidewalk porticoes and roof overhangs is encouraged.
      3.   Roof materials should be in keeping with the character of the
architectural style of the building. Recommended roof materials include slate
shingles, asphalt and fiberglass shingles, metal standing seam or tiles.
      4.   Crickets or other snow guard devices should be placed in such a way
that does not alter the form of the roof as seen from the street. (Ord. 2012-

LIMITED USE ZONE
SECTION:
13.63.010: Purpose Of Provisions
13.63.020: Permitted Uses
13.63.030: Conditional Uses
13.63.010: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
The general purpose of the Limited Use Zone is to allow a certain use to be
permitted. This will allow expansion and redeveloping of the traditional use.
However, when the use is discontinued a different new use may not be compatible
with the general area and thus will not be permitted. In a traditional zoning
district (zone) there are usually a number of permitted or conditional uses
listed as acceptable. There are times when only one type of use is desirable.
It is the intent of the City to protect uses and assure that they are legal and
do not risk any label of being non-conforming. Thus, the Limited Use Zone will
accomplish that intent. (Ord. 2018-06, 5-17-2018)
13.63.020: PERMITTED USES:
!!! None. (Ord. 2018-06, 5-17-2018)
13.63.030: CONDITIONAL USES:
!!! Restaurants with and without an alcoholic beverage control license. Site
plan review is required as per sections
13.08.040 and
13.08.080 of this title. (Ord. 2018-06, 5-17-2018)

REGIONAL/MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICT
SECTION:
13.65.010: Vision Statement
13.65.020: Purpose
13.65.030: Scope
13.65.040: Minimum Area Requirement
13.65.050: Development Ownership
13.65.060: Site Development Master Plan (SDMP)
13.65.070: Project Approval Procedures
13.65.080: Amendments To Site Development Master Plan
13.65.010: VISION STATEMENT:
The vision for the regional/mixed-use zoning district anticipates development
of a vibrant community within the greater community based on traditional
neighborhood development (TND) patterns. These traditional patterns include a
variety of housing types and workplaces, together with shopping, various
services, entertainment, and gathering spaces. By bringing many of the
activities of daily living into walking distance, designing walkable streets
and human scale buildings, lessening the effect of urban heat islands by
reducing asphalt surfaces and increasing landscaping, residents and visitors
alike will benefit. Lifestyle changes that include walkability, using public
transit and reducing the number and length of automobile trips, lessen traffic
congestion and its associated air pollution and support a sustainable
environment throughout the whole community. Regional commercial developments
are an important commercial asset of the city's tax base and of primary
importance for the economic health of the city. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.65.020: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to guide development within the zoning district,
while allowing flexibility, creative expression, minimize impact on surrounding
properties and assure quality control within the site. Development standards
for the R/M-U zoning district will allow for overall development that
encompasses a mix of uses including residential and nonresidential uses within
the same building, and inviting public and private spaces in a manner that
promotes walkability and human interaction. Guiding building location, massing,
architecture and mixture of uses is intended to produce a variety of spaces
within the site. Variety within the site will create a project that is safe,
comfortable, and interesting for pedestrians, will reduce vehicular/pedestrian
conflicts and will provide ample social and economic opportunities for those
persons and businesses that occupy the land and for those who will make the
development their destination. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.65.030: SCOPE:
All development within the R/M-U zoning district is subject to the provisions
and standards found herein. Additionally, other applicable regulation within
this title shall apply. A site development master plan (SDMP) specific to any
development and approved by the city council shall control the development of
all property within an R/M-U zoning district. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.65.040: MINIMUM AREA REQUIREMENT:
Any R/M-U zoning district shall be a minimum of thirty (30) contiguous acres.
This requirement does not preclude separate ownership of buildings within the
zoning district. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.65.050: DEVELOPMENT OWNERSHIP:
The development shall be in single, partnership, or corporate ownership or
under options to purchase by an individual or corporate entity at the time of
application, or the application shall be filed jointly by all owners of the
property. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.65.060: SITE DEVELOPMENT MASTER PLAN (SDMP):
   A.   The SDMP will serve in the same way as the city's general plan does in
guiding future growth in the larger community; it is a comprehensive but
flexible guide for the overall development and design of the entire site. The
SDMP summarizes the maximum contemplated extent of development and gives a
realistic indication of its mass, scale, appearance, relationship to
surrounding uses as well as how it internally functions.
   B.   The SDMP shall include the following elements:
      1.   Land use regulating plan showing the proposed distribution and types
of all uses, projected densities, etc.
      2.   An overall conceptual phasing/subdivision plan.
      3.   Open space/gathering place plan including location, size, etc.
      4.   Building massing and heights including proposed floor area ratio.

      6.   Traffic control and circulation plans and studies including
estimated traffic impacts during construction and demand at build out with
potential impacts and possible connections with mass transit, bike and
pedestrian trails facilities.
      7.   Overall parking plan.
      8.   Thoroughfare locations, types and direction of travel.
      9.   Street cross sections.
      10.   Typical examples of streetscape design including aesthetic
elements.
      11.   Overall conceptual site lighting plan.
      12.   Civil engineering conceptual plans including grading, storm
drainage and utilities.
      13.   Architectural elevations with examples of anticipated design
architectural style(s).

      5.   The city shall only approve an SDMP for those projects that comply
with the vision and purpose of this chapter, and other applicable sections of
this code.
   B.   Development Agreement: A development agreement between the developer
and the city of Holladay shall grant specific rights pursuant to an approved
site development master plan (SDMP) and shall include and specifically address
any additional development related considerations integral to the proposal not
already governed by applicable land use and planning regulations. The following
items shall specifically be addressed by the development agreement:
      1.   Duration of the development agreement.
      2.   The maximum height of buildings.
      3.   Land uses permitted, their minimum and maximum intensities and the
manner in which they are combined within the development site.
      4.   The density permitted within the development site, provided in
dwelling units per acre (DUA).
      5.   The intensity permitted within the development site, provided as a

restrictions accepted, which may encumber or otherwise affect the development
site.
   C.   Phasing: The site development master plan is for all parcels within the
R/M-U zoning district. Construction of the project may be phased as reasonably
needed by the developer. Each phase shall be of such size, composition and
arrangement that its construction, marketing and operation is feasible as a
unit independent of any subsequent phases. The planning commission shall review
and approve individual phases and/or subdivision plats of the project for
compliance to the SDMP and development agreement. Submissions for individual
phases of the project shall follow the submissions procedure as outlined in
chapters 13.06 and 13.08 of this title, the SDMP and/or as specified in the
development agreement.
   D.   Administrative Approval: Upon approval by the planning commission of
each phase of the project, individual elements including site preparation,
infrastructure improvements and specific buildings or structure permits shall
be approved by the community development director. No such approval shall be
granted unless the application meets requirements of the approved SDMP, the
development agreement and any other pertinent code or regulation.
   E.   Property Rezoned: For any property rezoned R/M-U, a building permit
must be issued pursuant to an approved SDMP and/or development agreement within
twenty four (24) months of the adoption of the zoning district or said zoning
shall expire reverting to the previous zone designation. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-
2012)
13.65.080: AMENDMENTS TO SITE DEVELOPMENT MASTER PLAN:
   A.   Material or substantive amendments to the overall SDMP shall require an
amendment to the SDMP.

CHAPTER 13.66
HOLLADAY CROSSROADS ZONE
SECTION:
13.66.010: Vision Statement
13.66.020: Purpose
13.66.030: Scope
13.66.040: Primary Uses
13.66.050: Accessory Uses
13.66.060: Non-conforming Uses And/Or Site Situations/Conditions
13.66.070: Project Approval Procedures
13.66.080: Development Standards
13.66.090: Design Standards
13.66.010: VISION STATEMENT:
   A.   It is intended that the Holladay Crossroads (HCR) Zone be an
economically healthy, primary gateway, mixed-use district within the City. The
HCR Zone is currently the second most valuable economic center in the City and
sales revenues from businesses therein greatly contributes to the City’s
budget. Future development in this area must not only provide economic benefits
to the property and business owners but contribute to the City’s overall
desirability and quality of life. Arguably positioned along the City’s most
prominent gateway, the HCR redevelopment area must create a sense of “arrival”
to people entering Holladay.
   B.   The HCR Zone offers a valuable opportunity for mixed-use and/or
commercial development as reflected in the Holladay adopted Crossroads Small
Area Master Plan (SAMP). The SAMP recommends future development that would
result in a commercial district with a higher density residential component,
or, mixed-use. The capacity of the roadways in the area can support this type
of future development and traffic growth can be accommodated with the roadway
enhancements proposed in the SAMP. This Zone anticipates the blending of older
strip commercial development with new, compatible mixed-use development through
flexible yet consistent, building design. HCR sanctioned land uses will be
influenced by traffic volumes occurring in the area and design themes will be
overseen by the City’s Design Review Board (DRB). (Ord. 2021-02, 3-4-2021)
13.66.020: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to identify and enhance the HCR Zone to
create a pattern for new development that is appropriately oriented and
situated toward public rights of way, provide an opportunity for increased
human interaction and protect and increase the economic vitality of the City.
It is not the intent of the HCR Zone to impair the rights of existing
businesses and property owners. Depending on individual circumstances, some
uses and structures existing at the time of adoption of this chapter within the
area devoted to HCR Zone may become non-conforming except as expressly stated
herein. The provisions of this chapter allow lawfully established buildings and
uses to continue in accordance with section 13.88 of this title.
   B.   It is intended that the HCR Zone becomes a place of diverse land uses
within an aesthetically attractive, easily accessible, and economically healthy
environment. A range and mix of commercial, service, and residential land use
are encouraged and desirable. High quality architecture and energy efficiency
for all new structures with attractive architectural and site features will
create dramatic, visual interest in the HCR Zone. This will encourage greater
bike and pedestrian access to the site and enhance the economic vitality of the
entire City. It is essential that new development is compatible with abutting
land uses and that potential impacts are minimized for abutting residential
property owners. (Ord. 2021-02, 3-4-2021)
13.66.030: SCOPE:
The provisions (including design review) of this title shall apply to any new
construction or remodeling for a residential, mixed-use or nonresidential use,
building, or structure located in the HCR Zone. For the purpose of this
section, “remodeling” means:
   A.   Any proposed action that will increase the footprint of the building;
   B.   Any exterior remodel which includes more than fifty percent (50%) of a
given facade. (Ord. 2021-02, 3-4-2021)
13.66.040: PRIMARY USES:
   A.   Permitted Uses: Primary uses of property that are, and shall be,
allowed to be developed and/or operated within the HCR Zone shall be set forth

   B.   Conditional Uses: Primary uses of property that may be allowed to be
developed and/or operated within the HCR Zone upon issuance by the City of a
Conditional Use Permit are identified in section
13.100 “Appendix A - Allowed Uses” of this title. As per section
13.88 of this title, any use legally existing as a conditional use in the HCR
Zone on the effective date of this chapter, is allowed to continue and is
subject to the requirements of the conditional use permit issued for such use.
Except as otherwise set forth in section
13.66.060 of this chapter, each conditional use shall conform to the
development standards and design guidelines of this chapter and other
applicable requirements of this title.
   C.   Mixed Or Combined Uses: (See subsection
13.71.020B of this chapter.) Any mixture or combination of allowed primary
property uses may be established within the same building or on the same lot or
parcel. If any such proposed uses require conditional use approval, that use
shall be reviewed by the planning commission as required by section
13.08.040 of this title.
   D.   Prohibited Uses: Property uses that are not allowed (i.e., are
prohibited) within the HCR Zone are, and shall be, as listed in section

14-2021)
13.66.090: DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes certain specific design review
standards intended to improve the quality and compatibility of development in
the HCR Zone. Design standards that employ the word “should” are intended to be
applied as stated. However, an alternative measure may be considered if it
meets or exceeds the intent of the guideline. Standards using the words “shall”
are mandatory. Standards using the words “encouraged” or “discouraged” are
desirable but not mandatory.
   B.   Site Accessibility: All new development shall include:
      1.   Sidewalks, alleys, plazas, landscaping and appropriately scaled
buildings that encourage and complement pedestrian activities.
      2.   Commercial buildings shall include clearly defined primary entrances
and large windows that display goods and services to create visual unity both
on the street and internally.
      3.   Sidewalk Clearance: At least seventy-two (72") of the sidewalk width
should be preserved for pedestrian movement in front of every building fronting
on a public right of way.
      4.   Pedestrian ADA Access: All plazas, arcades, and open-air seating
shall provide handicapped access.
      5.   Bicycle Parking: New development shall provide bicycle racks in
designated areas on-site as determined reasonable by the City. The racks shall
be permanently secured to a non-permeable surface, placed within thirty feet
(30') of the main entrance of the building(s) which they serve, shall provide
at least four feet (4') of clear space around their perimeter, and otherwise,
and, shall not obstruct pedestrian movement(s)”.
   C.   Parking Area Design (non-landscaping): Parking shall complement the
pedestrian activities and visual character of the Zone. Negative impacts of
parking lots and structures should be mitigated through sensitive design,
location and configuration. The following should be integrated into the design
on any new parking lot or structure:
      1.   Parking lots shall not be located on a corner facing an
intersection.
      2.   The number of parking lot entrances, driveways and curb cuts shall
be allowed in accordance with provisions in Title 14 of the Holladay City Code.
The City desires that the number of parking lot entrances, driveways and curb
cuts be minimized, where able in favor of combined driveways and coordinated
parking areas among property owners and reserves the right to require, where
reasonable, minimization during site plan review and approval by Technical
Review Committee (TRC) recommendation and Planning Commission approval. Cross
access between properties via service drive connectivity shall be required as
recommended by Staff or the TRC and required by the Commission.
      3.   Individual parking entrances and curb cuts on Van Winkle, Highland
Drive and 6200 South shall be consolidated to complement a coordinated parking
strategy and promote walkability and to comply with the vision of the Holladay
Crossroads Small Area Master Plan. New curb cuts are discouraged.
      4.   ADA compliant walk ways shall be constructed within a parking lot to
connect the sidewalk and building entrances.
      5.   Parking structures visible from the public rights-of-way shall be:
1) architecturally compatible in design and integrated with main buildings
which they serve; and, 2) The perimeter of each floor of a parking structure
facing a public street shall be screened to shield automobiles and any
mechanical appurtenances from public view; and 3) An architectural treatment,
landscaping, and/or space for pedestrian oriented businesses along the street
side edges of the parking structure should be provided.
   D.   Streetscape: The streetscape shall include public amenities such as
plazas, fountains, kiosks, public art, landscaping, signage, and other street
fixtures such as streetlights, decorative barriers/fencing, pedestrian benches
and trash receptacles.
   E.   Building Design: All new buildings in the HCR Zone shall feature
building facades that are made of high-quality finishes and materials.
Buildings facing public streets, especially on the ground floor level shall not
“turn their back” to the street, but instead provide ample window openings,
entrances, and design features to create interest and calm traffic.
      1.   Compatibility of New Buildings: All new buildings should be designed
with a unique character compatible with the objectives of the Holladay
Crossroads Zone and SAMP.
      2.   Building Mass: To avoid any large, continuous building mass of
uniform height, no portion of any multi-story building shall continue for more
than one hundred feet (100') horizontally along any street frontage without a
vertical break in the roofline. The required break in the building height shall
continue for a minimum of thirty feet (30') along the horizontal plane.
         a.   Break in Roofline: A “break in the roofline” is defined as per
13.66.3:
            (1)   A ten foot (10') minimum step-back of the vertical plane of
the building on the third story, second and third stories, or all stories; or
            (2)   A reduction in stories of the entire building.

          b.    Structur al Articula tion: The vertical planes of a building
shall be varied so that no continuo us elevation is longer than seventy five
feet (75') horizontally without a structural articulation (which may include
facade modulation, structural expressions, varied setbacks or heights, textural
modulations and/or projections such as balconies, cornices, covered entrances,
arcades or colonnades or other architectural element dividing the facade
visually to provide relief to perceived building mass from the street
elevation) as per 13.66.4.

      3.    Streetscape Perspective: All building fronts shall provide features
that are designed to be consistent with pedestrian activity and that provide a
variety of architectural interest and detail that can be viewed from both
vehicular and pedestrian perspective as per 13.66.5

      4.   Facade Embellishment: All building elevations readily visible from
public view shall provide consistency in architectural design elements/
embellishments. In addition, a contiguous building wall (longer than 50 feet)
shall have a building element to visually divide the facade (which may include
windows, a recessed entrance or other appropriate variations) as per 13.66.6
Figure 13.66.6

      5.    Shading for Pedestrians: At least twenty percent (20%) of walls
facing sidewalks or other pedestrian accessible space shall be architecturally
treated with a shade/weather protecting element such as an awning, arcade,
trellis, or other overhanging architectural feature(s) consistent with the
overall building(s) architecture.
      6.   Primary Entrances: Primary entrances to commercial buildings shall
be recessed, providing a shaded area that helps to define doorways and provide
shelter for pedestrians. Repetition of recessed entries shall also be used to
provide a rhythm of shadows along the street to help establish a sense of
scale. Entrance doors shall be topped with transom windows to extend the
vertical emphasis of these openings.
      7.   Maintaining an Expression Line: Upper stories of buildings shall
maintain an expression line along the facade such as a setback, change of
material, or a projection to reduce perceived building mass.
      8.   Consistency of Architectural Style: All buildings shall have an
articulated base course and cornice ornamented with details consistent with the
chosen architectural style. The middle section of the building shall be divided
either horizontally or vertically in a manner consistent with the selected
style. Buildings may have upper story features which improve the relationship
between the upper story and the street. Such features include, but are not
limited to, balconies, roof decks, bay windows, or upper story commercial
activities.
      9.   Mixing of Styles: A compatible mix of architectural styles for the
Holladay Crossroads Zone is acceptable provided that some basic design features
which complement each other are present throughout the site.
         a.   In order to encourage design consistency, all major new
construction shall include at least three (3) of the following elements on the
street facing facades:
            (1)   Window and door treatment which embellishes the façade.
            (2)   Decorative light fixtures.
            (3)   Unique facade treatment, such as decorative materials and
design elements.
            (4)   Decorative paving.
            (5)   Trellises, railings, gates, grillwork, or unique landscaping.
         b.   The DRB and TRC may recommend other elements in place of the
above elements for approval by the Planning Commission.
      10.   Oriented to the Corner: Buildings on corner lots shall be oriented
to the corner. Corner entries and/or architectural treatment should be used to
emphasize the corner.
      11.   Emphasis of HCR Identity: Any main building located at the
intersection of Highland Drive and 6200 South shall have a prominent scale and
iconic design to emphasize the importance of this vital gateway of Holladay as
indicated in the SAMP.
      12.   Window and Door Designs: Windows and doors shall be used to define
the character of buildings by giving scale to the building and providing visual
interest to the composition of individual facades. Distinct window and door
designs shall be used to help define building styles. Articulated, transparent
facades shall be created along vehicular and pedestrian rights of way,
including display windows as a link between both vehicles and pedestrians and
activities in the building.
         a.   In keeping with the intent of these design guidelines, the
following shall apply to any street level building facade:
            (1)   Major new construction shall have at least fifty percent
(50%) of the length of the ground floor facade between the height of two feet
zero inches (2'0") and eight feet zero inches (8'0") devoted to windows and
doors affording views into retail, office, or lobby space.
            (2)   Highly tinted or mirrored glass windows, shades, blinds or
screens that prevent pedestrian view into buildings shall not be permitted.
         b.   Windows on the second or third level shall be proportioned in
favor of verticality, and, the design of surrounding window casing, the depth
and profile of window sash element, and the material of which they are
constructed shall be distinctly associated with the specific building style.
         c.   Awnings and ground level canopies should contribute to the
architectural theme of the structure to which they are affixed and shall be
integrated within a building’s design. Awnings shall be constructed of
traditional materials and located over windows and doors.
         d.   On multi-storefront buildings, separate awnings shall be located
within each storefront opening so that the building frame and details are
revealed.
         e.   Retractable and fixed awnings are allowed and encouraged.
         f.   Under awning lights that are designed to specifically illuminate
the sidewalk and storefront are permitted.
      13.   Reinforcement of Design: Building design should reinforce the
building’s location abutting the street edge and public space.
      14.   Use of Customized Components: Prototype design for franchises,
formula or national chains shall use customized components consistent with the
design requirements for the HCR Zone that reinforce visual consistency with
other buildings in the Holladay Crossroads Zone area.
         a.   Building Materials: Exterior finish materials selected should be
part of a strong architectural theme and shall not appear as a material foreign
to the character of the building nor to the Holladay Crossroads Zone.
         b.   Building exteriors shall be constructed from high quality and
durable materials. It is important that the materials and colors will weather
well and need minimal maintenance. Acceptable exterior finish materials include
the following:
            (1)   Painted, stained or weathered wood siding such as, 4-
S shingles, board and batten and clapboard.
            (2)   Artificial wood siding such as painted Cementous fiberboard.
            (3)   Brick or natural stone.
            (4)   EIFS (synthetic stucco) (not more than 50 percent of all
exterior finished surfaces).
            (5)   Stucco, but as a minority material.
            (6)   Synthetic stone.
            (7)   Architectural finish or decorative faced Concrete Masonry
Units (CMUs). No portion of a building constructed of standard CMUs shall be
visible from an existing public right of way. Exposed concrete walls should be
architecturally treated. The enhancement must include joint treatments,
textured concrete such as exposed aggregate, sandblast and/or colored concrete,
or other decorative finishes.
            Beveled metal siding, mirrored glass, vinyl siding, and backlit
awnings shall not be used.
      15.   Roofs: The character of a roof is a major feature for a structure.
The roof pitch, its materials, size and orientation are all distinct features
that should contribute to the character of the building. Shadows created by
traditional overhangs should contribute to the perception of a building’s
scale. Roof designs should relate to the building facade articulations.
Accordingly:
         a.   A variety of roof types and configurations shall be used to add
interest and reduce perceived building bulk.
         b.   Use of sidewalk porticos and roof overhangs is allowed and
encouraged.
         c.   Roof materials shall be in keeping with the character of the
architectural style of the building. Recommended roof materials include slate
shingles, asphalt and fiberglass shingles, metal standing seam or tiles.
         d.   Crickets or other snow guard devices should be placed in such a
way that they do not alter the form of the roof as seen from the street.
         e.   Decorative roof accessories such as cresting, ridge caps, and
finials may be used.
         f.   Roof-top amenities are allowed provided they do not create
enclosed (i.e., walled in) space. Examples of allowable elements include, but
are not limited to: landscape features, patio covers or other overhead shade
structures, plazas, fire pits, pools, game facilities, lounge seating/spaces,
etc.
      16.   Building Color(s):
         a.   A harmonious range of colors shall be used within the HCR Zone.
            b.   Neon or very bright colors (which have the effect of
unreasonably setting the building apart from other adjacent buildings on the
street) shall not be used or allowed within the Zone.
      c.   Bright colors should be used only for trim and accents.
         d.   The TRC may recommend approval of bright colors if the use is
consistent with the building design and other design requirements.
      17.   Service Areas: See standards in Section
13.71.
      18.   Mechanical Equipment: Ground and roof-top mechanical equipment such
as heating and air conditioning units, TV antennas and satellite dishes shall
be hidden or screened so as to minimize visual impacts. All noise emitting
equipment shall be placed so as to minimize noise impacts on nearby properties.
         a.   Lattice, open brick enclosures, or vegetation may be used to
conceal mechanical equipment. Screening material should be properly maintained.
If vegetation is used for screening, the mature size of the vegetation should
be considered so that equipment air flow will not be compromised.
         b.   All mechanical equipment shall be shown on the preliminary site
plans prepared for architectural review. The Planning Commission may recommend
the location, screening, and painting of such equipment as part of the project
plan review process.
         c.   Screening materials shall be designed to be compatible or
complementary with the building.
   F.   Fencing:
      1.   Only decorative solid walls (e.g., masonry, pre-poured concrete
panel inserts, etc.) or black, wrought-iron including simulated wrought iron
fencing shall be used upon any commercially used property(ies) within the HCR
Zone.
      2.   Only decorative solid walls (e.g., masonry, pre-poured concrete
panel inserts, etc.) or black, wrought-iron including simulated wrought iron
fencing shall be used on/along the external boundary/property lines of land
within the HCR Zone. (Ord. 2021-02, 3-4-2021)
CHAPTER 13.71
HOLLADAY VILLAGE ZONE
SECTION:
13.71.010: Vision And Purpose
13.71.020: Scope
13.71.030: Primary Uses
13.71.040: Accessory Uses
13.71.050: Nonconforming Development
13.71.060: Relocation Of Existing Uses Within The Zone

13.71.075: Development Standards
13.71.080: Design Guidelines
13.71.090: Illustrations
13.71.010: VISION AND PURPOSE:
   A.   It is intended that the Holladay Village (HV) Zone reflect the vision
and goals of the Holladay Village Master Plan of the Holladay General Plan and
facilitates a special, unique place for people to gather, shop, recreate, and
enjoy the views of the surrounding mountains. The Holladay Village primarily
caters first to the residents of Holladay providing goods and services that
encourage them to shop and recreate at home rather than outside of the City. It
is intended that the character of the Holladay Village become a place of human
scaled, diverse land uses within an aesthetically attractive, easily
accessible, and economically healthy environment. A pedestrian scale
environment will be created through building height and mass, and orienting
structures toward the streets and sidewalks. A range of commercial, service,
public, and residential land use, including mixed-use is desired. Charming,
traditional, early Utah architecture with some flexibility for individual
expression employing high quality materials and energy efficiency and site
features will create visual interest, encourage greater pedestrian and bike
use, and enhance the image and economic vitality of the entire City.
   Because the Village is intersected by a crossroads, an inherent conflict
between pedestrians and vehicular traffic arises. By creating a walkable
Village with a unique character catering equally to pedestrians and vehicles in
one or all quadrants of the Village, it is hoped these objectives may be
accomplished.
   B.   Another important goal of the Village is the preservation and
enhancement of surrounding residential neighborhoods. These neighborhoods
supply much of the patronage of commercial uses within the Village;
consequently, care should be taken in the review of development of the Village
to protect nearby residential uses from adverse impacts such as uncontrolled
traffic, spillover parking, and noise and light pollution. Particular attention
shall be paid to Locust Lane-Hugo Avenue, Phylden Drive, Clearview Street,
Kentucky Avenue, and Arbor Lane to ensure that most traffic to and from the
Village is contained on arterial streets and not through surrounding
residential neighborhoods.
   To achieve these goals, in part, street level floor space immediately
abutting 2300 East, Holladay Boulevard, Murray-Holladay Road, and Laney Avenue
between 2300 East and Holladay Boulevard and abutting Holladay Village Plaza,
as shown in section
13.71.080,
figure 13.71.4 of this chapter shall be retail use only with the exception of
small street level lobby areas that lead to upper story uses.
   However, it is not the intent of this chapter to impair the rights of
existing businesses and property owners. Therefore, land uses and structures
legally existing at the time of adoption of this chapter shall be treated as
nonconforming uses and structures, except as expressly stated herein. The
provisions of this chapter allow lawfully established buildings and uses to
continue but limits their expansion or modification unless brought into
compliance with the requirements herein except for previously established drive
thru uses.
   C.   To ensure the architectural and aesthetic goals of this section are
met, any development within the HV Zone shall first be reviewed by the Design
Review Board (DRB). The DRB determines a project’s degree of overall conformity
with the architectural design guidelines set forth in this chapter and makes,
in a timely fashion, a recommendation. These guidelines are established to
create and enhance a sense of place and visual continuity within the HV Zone.
   D.   Approval of any applicable land use application, as provided for in
this chapter, within the Zone may only be given by the Planning Commission.
Recommendations of the DRB are non-binding upon the Planning Commission and
shall be considered.
   E.   Appeals from decisions of the Planning Commission or where appropriate
as set forth herein, shall be made to the City Council in accordance with the
provisions of section
13.08.040 of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2014-15, 8-21-
2014; Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.020: SCOPE:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any new construction or
remodeling for a mixed-use residential or nonresidential use, building, or
structure located in the HV Zone. For the purpose of this section, “remodeling”
means:
   A.   Any proposed action that will increase the floor area of the premises;
   B.   Any interior remodel which includes more than fifty percent (50%) of
the structure’s footprint; or
   C.   Any change in use that requires a change of occupancy type under the
applicable building or safety code.
   D.   The Planning Commission, upon recommendation of the Community and
Economic Development Director, may waive applicable requirements of the Zone
for buildings or uses that cannot reasonably comply within the context of goals
for the Zone due to shape of property, historic nature of structures, or the
pre-existing use of a structure. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-05,
3-4-2021)
13.71.030: PRIMARY USES:
   A.   Permitted Uses: The permitted uses allowed in the HV Zone shall be as
set forth in chapter 13.100, “Appendix A - Allowed Uses”, of this title.
   B.   Conditional Uses: Any use legally existing as a conditional use in the
HV Zone on the effective date of this chapter, is allowed to continue and is
subject to the requirements of the conditional use permit issued for such use.
Except as otherwise set forth in section
13.71.060 of this chapter, each conditional use shall conform to the
development standards and design guidelines of this chapter and other
applicable requirements of this title.
   C.   Mixed or Combined Uses: (See subsection
13.71.020B of this chapter.) Any mixture or combination of allowed uses may be
established within the same building or on the same lot or parcel. If any of
the proposed uses are a conditional use, that use shall be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission as required by section
13.08.040 of this title. Denial of a conditional use within a mixed-use
building does not automatically result in denial of conforming use(s) and/or
the site plan.
   D.   Prohibited Uses: Any primary or accessory land use not shown as a
permitted or conditional use in
chapter 13.100, “Appendix A - Allowed Uses”, of this title shall be prohibited.
   E.   Hours: None of the foregoing uses shall be open to the public between
the hours of twelve o’clock (12:00) midnight and six o’clock (6:00) A.M. except
for hotels and bed-and-breakfast uses. (Ord. 2014-15, 8-21-2014; amd. Ord.
2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.040: ACCESSORY USES:
Permitted and conditional uses set forth in
chapter 13.100, “Appendix A - Allowed Uses”, of this title shall be deemed to
include accessory uses and activities that are necessarily and customarily
associated with and incidental and subordinate to such primary uses allowed by
chapter 13.100, “Appendix A - Allowed Uses”, of this title.
   A.   Accessory uses shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to
permitted and conditional uses in the Zone except as otherwise expressly
provided in this title.
   B.   No accessory use, building or structure, shall be allowed on a lot or
parcel unless a primary permitted or conditional use is currently established
on the parcel except as allowed by section
13.09.020 of this title.
   C.   Specific accessory uses allowed in the HV Zone are as set forth in
chapter 13.100, “Appendix A -Allowed Uses”, of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-
2012; amd. Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.050: NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT:
Notwithstanding any contrary provision set forth in
chapter 13.88 of this title, an existing permitted or conditional use which
does not conform to the development standards and design guidelines set forth
in this chapter may be continued; provided, however, that any expansion of such
use which will increase the floor area of the premises, any interior remodel
which includes more than fifty percent (50%) of the structure; or any change in
use that requires a change of occupancy type under the applicable building or
safety code shall be subject to those development standards and design
guidelines set forth in this chapter to which it can reasonably comply. (Ord.
2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.060: RELOCATION OF EXISTING USES WITHIN THE ZONE:
   A.   For the purposes of redevelopment, existing uses established within the
HV Zone may be allowed to relocate and continue the use on the same parcel or
lot on another parcel or lot within the HV Zone by approval of the Planning
Commission with a recommendation from the Holladay City Redevelopment Agency
Board, and are exempt from the provisions of
chapter 13.88 of this title.
   B.   Approval of the relocation or continued use does not exempt the use
from the other provisions of the HV Zone. (Ord. 2013-26, 10-10-2013; amd. Ord.
2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.065: PROJECT APPROVAL:
All project/site plans for new construction and/or remodeling of existing
structures within the HV Zone shall be approved by the Planning Commission as
outlined in the following section. Site layout and building design approval for
accessory structures proposed as ancillary uses for existing, primary uses may
be reviewed and approved by the Community and Economic Development Director
following a review and recommendation by the Design Review Board. (Ord. 2012-
15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.070: PROJECT APPROVAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application: The conceptual design of any application for development
located in the HV Zone which requires approval by the Planning Commission shall
be reviewed by the DRB as provided in this section.
      1.   The Community and Economic Development Director shall establish
uniform submittal requirements to facilitate design review and provide
consistency in information for decision making. An application subject to
design review shall include such information as may be reasonably required by
the director and may include site plans, building sections, exterior
elevations, photographs of the subject or abutting properties, perspective
drawings, description of building materials, color samples, exterior lighting,
fence plans, signs, and landscaping plans.
   B.   Review By Community and Economic Development Director: Following
submission of a conceptual design plan, the Community and Economic Development
Director and TRC shall review the plan application for compliance with
applicable regulations.
      1.   The Community and Economic Development Director shall notify the
applicant of staff recommendation of an approval or denial (for noncompliance)
of the conceptual design plan review findings and comments, and the need for
other information which may assist the DRB in making its recommendation to the
Planning Commission.
      2.   The applicant shall address identified conflicts and mitigate
adverse aspects of the design concept plan prior to forwarding the plan to the
DRB for review.
      3.   When the Community and Economic Development Director determines,
after review of the conceptual design plan, that one or more of the application
requirements and procedural steps is not applicable to the application under
consideration, such requirements may be waived in writing.
   C.   Review By DRB: Following receipt of an application from the Community
and Economic Development Director, the DRB shall review the proposed conceptual
design plan for compliance with the HV Zone design guidelines set forth in
section
13.71.090 of this chapter. At the conclusion of the review, the DRB shall make
a recommendation to the Planning Commission to accept the design concept as
submitted, provisionally accept the design concept subject to plan revisions
necessary to achieve compliance with the design guidelines, or continue design
concept for preparation of a new design concept if the concept is substantially
out of compliance with the design guidelines.
   D.   Review By Planning Commission: Following action by the DRB, the
Planning Commission shall consider the Board’s recommendations at the
Commission’s next regular meeting. The Planning Commission shall review the
proposed design concept for compliance with the HV Zone design guidelines set
forth in section
13.71.090 of this chapter and shall consider the recommendations of the DRB. At
the conclusion of the review, the Planning Commission shall act to accept the
design concept as submitted, provisionally accept the design concept subject to
plan revisions necessary to achieve compliance with the design guidelines, or
remand back to the DRB for further study. Applicants unwilling to make
revisions directed by the Planning Commission in a provisionally accepted
concept design or continued design concept may request denial of the
application so that an appeal may be filed.
      1.   Following Planning Commission approval of a conceptual design plan,
a conceptual site plan application may be submitted as provided in chapter
13.03 of this title and acted upon as provided in section 13.08.010 of this
title. Upon approval of the conceptual site plan, the applicant may submit a
preliminary site plan. Upon approval of the preliminary site plan, a final site
plan may be submitted to the planning commission or to the technical review
committee delegated by the planning commission for final site plan approval.
The land use authority may approve a final site plan only if the final design
plans are consistent with the approved preliminary plan and the design
guidelines set forth in section
13.71.090 of this chapter.
      2.   Action by the Planning Commission shall be based on written findings
stating the reasons for the action. Findings shall be based on information in
the record. In approving a design review application, conditions may be imposed
as needed to conform the application with provisions of the Holladay general
plan, this title, and the design guidelines set forth in this chapter. The
Planning Commission may not impose any condition or require any modification
which is inconsistent with a requirement of this code.
      3.   An adversely affected person may appeal a Planning Commission
decision to approve or deny a conceptual design plan or final design plan by
filing a written appeal to the City Council pursuant to the requirements of
subsection
13.71.020G of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2016-13, 5-26-
2016; Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.075: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following minimum development standards shall apply in the HV Zone.
Application of the design guidelines set forth in section

and utility while ensuring the enjoyment of a starry night for all members of
the community.
   Except as provided herein, or unless otherwise explicitly approved by the
Planning Commission the light source shall be a full cutoff fixture, completely
concealed within an opaque housing. All exterior lighting fixtures designed or
placed so as to illuminate any portion of a site shall meet standards generally
accepted as Dark Sky compliant. Specifically, lighting sources and fixtures
shall meet the following requirements:
      1.   Fixture (Luminaire): Where the design for an area may suggest the
use of lighting fixtures of a particular “period” or architectural style,
fixtures other than full cutoff fixtures may be used if the lumens generated by
each fixture do not exceed five thousand five hundred (5,500) and if the
mounting heights of such fixtures do not exceed fifteen feet (15'). Fixtures
used under gasoline canopies and other structural canopies shall be flat lens,
recessed lens, or drop lens with glare shields. Use of drop lens without glare
shields is prohibited.
      2.   Light Source (Lamp): Only LED, incandescent, fluorescent, metal
halide, or color corrected high pressure sodium may be used. LED is the
preferred light source. The same type shall be used for the same or similar
types of lighting on any one site. No colors other than white or off white
(light yellow tones in the kelvin scale of 5,000k or lower, i.e. warmer) may be
used for any light source for the lighting of signs, structures or the overall
site unless the DRB deems such lighting to be appropriate to the design theme
of the proposed development. Noncolor corrected low pressure sodium and mercury
vapor light sources are prohibited.
      3.   Mounting: Fixtures shall be mounted in such a manner that the cone
of light does not cross any property line of the site. Poles shall be black,
dark gray, dark brown, dark green, or earth tone. The height of the pole
mounted light shall not exceed twenty-five feet (25') above grade. Any fixtures
located within any required buffer shall not exceed twelve feet (12') above
grade. Wall mounted fixtures intended to illuminate walkways or paths shall not
exceed thirteen feet (13') above the pedestrian pathway. For purposes of these
regulations, the mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined as the
vertical distance from the grade elevation of the surface being illuminated to
the bottom of the lighting fixture (i.e., luminaire).
      4.   Submittal Requirements: Project plan submittals shall be prepared by
a lighting professional and include a site lighting plan at a scale of one inch
to twenty feet (1" - 20') or other scale acceptable to the city which shows:
         a.   All proposed exterior lighting in relation to existing and
proposed buildings, trees, landscaping, parking areas;
         b.   Specifications for all proposed lighting fixtures including
fixture design, type of lamp, wattage, designation as “cutoff fixtures, lumens
or light contour study and other descriptive information on the fixtures; and
         c.   Proposed mounting height and placement of all exterior lighting
fixtures.
      5.   Timers And Dimmers: Lighting installations shall include timers,
dimmers and/or sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate
unneeded lighting.
      6.   Holiday Lighting: Holiday lighting during the months of October,
November, December, and January shall be exempt from the provisions of this
section, provided that such holiday lighting does not create dangerous glare on
adjacent streets or properties.
      7.   Light Trespass: In addition to the general provisions of this
subsection, all site lighting shall be shielded and/or directed in such a
manner that it illuminates only the user’s premises and does not spill over
into neighboring residential areas so as to interfere with the peaceful
enjoyment of residential or public properties.
      8.   Architectural Feature Lighting: Architectural feature lighting
including wall washer spotlights are permitted.
      9.   Nonconforming Fixtures: Except where otherwise noted, all outdoor
lighting fixtures existing and legally installed and operative before the
effective date of this code are exempt from the requirements of this
subsection. Whenever a nonconforming fixture is replaced, upgraded or moved,
the replacement fixture shall meet the requirements of this code.
   J.   Utility Lines: All new utility lines such as electric, telephone, CATV,
or other similar lines serving individual sites shall be placed underground.
Where feasible, utility lines necessary within the property shall be placed
underground. All utility lines shall be placed underground in new construction
projects that require building permits and site redesign. All junction and
access boxes shall be located to the side or the rear of the building unless
public safety concerns dictate otherwise. All utility pads shall be shown on
the project plan. Any utility connections, meter boxes, etc., shall be
integrated with the architectural elements of the project plan.
   K.   Buffer Standards For Proposed Development Abutting Residential Property
Not In The HV Zone:
      1.   The minimum building setback for any building is twenty feet (20')
from any point on an abutting non-HV Zone property line.
      2.   Building height shall not exceed the “graduated height envelope” as
defined in subsection K.2.a of this section.
         a.   The “graduated height envelope” is defined by projecting a
vertical plane from the property line to a height of six feet (6') and then
slanting upward and toward the interior of the HV Zone property at a forty-
five-degree (45°) angle. Refer to
figure 13.71.5 of this section for graphic representation of the graduated
height envelope.
         b.   The graduated height envelope applies to properties within the HV
Zone that abut residentially zoned properties not in the HV Zone.
         c.   Some architectural elements may be exempt as defined in section
13.76.190 of this title.
FIGURE 13.71.5
GRADUATED HEIGHT ENVELOPE

      3 .    Maximum building height shall not exceed the limits shown on
figure 13.71.3 of this section.
      4.   A six foot (6') high screening wall or fence may be constructed
along the property line which is the boundary between the HV Zone and an
abutting residential zone. Such fence or wall shall include design and other
decorative elements consistent with the design of the new building. This
requirement may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission if it can be
demonstrated that existing walls or fences provide the desired buffering and
aesthetic effect or can be altered to do so.
      5.   A landscaping buffer strip (not in addition to the minimum building
setback) of five feet (5') as per chapter 13.77 of this title, shall be
provided parallel to the fence or wall to allow for the planting of appropriate
trees, or other vegetation anticipated to provide either shade, screening and/
or beauty at the common property line.
      6.   A primary or accessory building or structure shall not have a
single, unbroken facade longer than fifty feet (50').
      7.   No trash receptacle or storage area shall be located closer than
fifty feet (50') from a residence on an abutting property not in the HV Zone
unless located within a fully enclosed building.
      8.   Site lighting shall be designed to direct lighting away from
residential property. The use of energy efficient, color and intensity-
controlled LED lighting shall be as per subsection I of this section is.
      9.   An outdoor dining facility shall be constructed in a manner which
visually obscures the facility from abutting residential property and which
protects the property from noise and light emanating from the facility.
      10.   Mechanical equipment, including penthouses and elevator shafts,
shall be screened and soundproofed so that its presence or operation does not
violate the noise ordinance or create a nuisance for the occupants of any
abutting residence.
   L.   Signs: Signs in the HV Zone shall be governed by the provisions of
section
13.82.200 of this title except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord.
2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2014-15, 8-21-2014; 2015-02, 2-5-2015; 2016-31,
12-1-2016; 2020-02, 2-6-2020; Ord. 2021-05, 3-4-2021)
13.71.080: DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes design guidelines intended to improve
the quality and compatibility of development in the HV Zone. Guidelines that
employ the word “should” are intended to be applied as stated. However, an
alternative measure may be considered if it meets or exceeds the intent of the
guideline. Guidelines using the words “shall” are mandatory. Guidelines using
the words “encouraged” or “discouraged” are desirable but not mandatory.
Following are a series of design principles viewed as fundamental in achieving
the design objectives of the Holladay Village.
   B.   Pedestrian Access: All new development shall be designed with the
pedestrian in mind. Sidewalks, pedestrian alleys, exterior plazas, landscaping,
and buildings of a size and proportion that encourage and complement pedestrian
activities including walking, outdoor dining and seating, public gatherings,
and window shopping. Commercial buildings shall include clearly defined primary
entrances and large windows that display goods and services to create a visual
unity on the street and enhance the pedestrian experience. New drive-through
uses are not conducive to safe and attractive pedestrian activity and shall not
be allowed. Those drive-through entrances currently in operation that have been
in place prior to the enactment of these standards may be continued on the same
property as part of a site plan approval or site plan amendment approved by the
Planning Commission, as allowed by section
13.71.075 of this chapter
      1.   At least sixty inches (60") of the sidewalk width shall be preserved
for pedestrian movement in front of every building fronting on a public right
of way.
      2.   Creatively designed, clean, and functional alleys provide for
vehicular access and pedestrian linkages at mid blocks locations and in between
properties. Lighting shall be provided for pedestrian safety at these
locations. Amenities such as seating, protection from the elements, and
decorative elements such as planters and art or other public space enhancements
shall be also incorporated to encourage pedestrian circulation.
      3.   All plazas, arcades, and open-air seating shall provide handicapped
access.
   C.   Parking: Parking should be integrated with the design of the Holladay
Village and complement the pedestrian activities and visual character of the
Village. Intrusive impacts of parking lots and structures should be mitigated
through sensitive design, location, and configuration. The following should be
integrated into the design on any new parking lot or structure:
      1.   Parking lots shall not be located on a corner facing an
intersection.
      2.   The number of parking lot entrances, driveways and curb cuts shall
be minimized in favor of combined driveways and coordinated parking areas among
property owners.
      3.   Individual parking entrances and curb cuts on Holladay Boulevard
and/or Murray Holladay Road shall be consolidated wherever reasonably possible
to complement a coordinated parking strategy and promote walkability.
      4.   Pedestrian walkways, which comply with ADA standards, shall be
constructed within a parking lot to connect the sidewalk and building
entrances. Raised concrete pavement should be provided where the walkway
traverses between parking stalls and/or is abutting vehicular circulation.
      5.   Parking structures visible from the public rights of way shall be
architecturally integrated or designed with an architectural theme similar to
the main buildings.
      6.   The perimeter of each floor of a parking structure facing a public
street shall have a screening mechanism designed to shield automobiles and any
mechanical appurtenances from public view. An architectural treatment,
landscaping and/or space for pedestrian oriented businesses along the street
side edges of the parking structure should be provided.
   D.   Streetscape: The streetscape in the urban landscape shall include
elements such as streets, sidewalks, plazas, fountains, kiosks, public art,
landscaping, signage, and other street fixtures such as streetlights,
pedestrian benches, and trash receptacles. New development in the Holladay
Village shall complement and incorporate design elements established by the
City within public rights of way.
   E.   Building Design: It is the intent of this subsection to encourage
timeless architectural designs and building facades in keeping with the
historical character of early Utah architecture that has been lost in the
commercial center of Holladay. Typical design elements shall include three (3)
levels: the bottom or street (storefront) level, the middle or shaft level, and
the top or parapet level with articulated or ornamental cornices or rooflines
each of the levels having different proportions and composition of openings and
ornamentation. Storefronts should include display windows, separated by simple
vertical piers or classical columns, located below, for example, decorative
cornices, fascia boards, and divide-light transom windows with simple fabric
awnings above decorative bulkheads. Signs should be mounted on the lintel above
the first story or painted directly on the inside of display windows.
      1.   Compatibility Of New Buildings: All new buildings shall be designed
with a unique character compatible with the objectives of the Holladay Village
Zone.
      2.   Building Mass: To avoid any large, continuous building mass of
uniform height, no portion of any three-story building shall continue for more
than one hundred feet (100') horizontally along any street frontage without a
break in the roofline. The required break in the building height shall continue
for a minimum of thirty feet (30') along the horizontal plane before
recontinuation of the three-story height.
         a.   Break In Roofline: A “break in the roofline” is defined as:
            (1)   A ten foot (10') minimum step back of the vertical plane of
the building on the third story, second, and third stories, or all stories; or
            (2)   A reduction to two (2) stories of the entire building.
         b.   Structural Articulation: The vertical planes of a building shall
be varied so that no continuous elevation is longer than seventy five feet
(75') horizontally without a structural articulation which may include facade
modulation, structural expressions, varied setbacks or heights, textural
modulations and/or projections such as balconies, cornices, covered entrances,
arcades or colonnades or other architectural element dividing the facade
visually to provide relief to perceived building mass from the street
elevation.

      4.   Facade Embellishment: Any building wall visible from a public right
of way or from a public parking structure shall incorporate architectural
design embellishments which are compatible with other publicly visible parts of
the building. In addition, a contiguous building wall (longer than 50 feet)
shall have a building element, dividing the facade visually which may include
windows, a recessed entrance or other appropriate variations. The Planning
Commission may approve the use of simulated or faux windows for neighborhood
market, large uses where transparent glass installations conflict with
necessary interior functions.

      5.   Shading For Pedestrians: At least twenty percent (20%) of walls
facing the sidewalk or other pedestrian accessible space shall be
architecturally treated with a shade/weather protecting element such as an
awning, arcade, trellis, overhanging architectural feature consistent with the
overall building architecture.
FIGURE 13.71.10

      6.   Primary Entrances: Primary entrances to commercial buildings shall
be recessed, providing a shaded area that helps to define doorways and provide
shelter for pedestrians. Repetition of recessed entries should also be used to
provide a rhythm of shadows along the street to help establish a sense of
scale. Entrance doors should be topped with transom windows to extend the
vertical emphasis of these openings.
      7.   Maintaining An Expression Line: Upper stories of buildings shall
maintain an expression line along the facade such as a setback, change of
material, or a projection to reduce the perceived building mass.
      8.   Consistency Of Architectural Style: All buildings should have an
articulated base course and cornice ornamented with details consistent with the
chosen architectural style. The middle section of the building is suggested to
be divided either horizontally or vertically in a manner consistent with the
selected style. Buildings may have upper story features which improve the
relationship between the upper story and the street. Such features include, but
are not limited to, balconies, roof decks, bay windows or upper story
commercial activities
         a.   In order to encourage design consistency, all major new
construction shall include at least three (3) of the following elements on the
street facing facades:
            (1)   Window and door treatment which embellishes the facade.
            (2)   Decorative light fixtures.
            (3)   Unique facade treatment, such as decorative materials and
design elements.
            (4)   Decorative paving.
            (5)   Trellises, railings, gates, grillwork, or unique landscaping.
         b.   The Design Review Board may recommend other elements in place of
the above for approval by the Planning Commission.
      9.   Mixing Of Styles: A compatible mix of styles for the Holladay
Village is acceptable providing that some basic design features which
complement each other are present.
      10.   Oriented To The Corner: Buildings on corner lots shall be oriented
to the corner. Corner entries and/or architectural treatment should be used to
emphasize the corner.
      11.   Emphasis Of Identity: Public buildings, unique community structures
and corner structures should have a prominent scale, emphasizing their
identity.
      12.   Window And Door Designs: Windows and doors shall be used to define
the character of buildings by giving scale to the building and providing visual
interest to the composition of individual facades. Distinct window and door
designs are to be used to help define building styles. Articulated, transparent
facades should be created along pedestrian rights of way, including display
windows as a link between pedestrians and activities in the building.
         a.   In keeping with the intent of these design guidelines, the
following shall apply to any street level building facade:
            (1)   Major new construction shall have at least fifty percent
(50%) of the length of the ground floor facade between the height of two feet
zero inches (2'0") and eight feet zero inches (8'0") devoted to windows and
doors affording views into retail, office, or lobby space.
            (2)   For neighborhood market, large uses where transparent facade
treatments are not possible due to interior function, simulated or faux window
may be traded as per subsection E4 of this section.
            (3)   Highly tinted or mirrored glass windows, shades, blinds or
screens that prevent pedestrian view into buildings shall not be permitted.
         b.   Windows on the second or third level shall be vertically
proportioned and the design of surrounding window casing, the depth and profile
of window sash element, and the material of which they are constructed shall be
distinctly associated with the specific building style.
         c.   Awnings and canopies contribute to architectural themes and
pedestrian oriented character of the Village and shall be integrated within the
building design. Awnings constructed of traditional and durable materials shall
be oriented over windows and doors.
         d.   On multi-storefront buildings, separate awnings should be located
within each recessed storefront opening so that the building frame and details
are revealed.
         e.   Retractable and fixed awnings are allowed.
         f.   Under-awning lights that are designed to specifically illuminate
the sidewalk and storefront are permitted.
      13.   Reinforcement Of Design: Building design should reinforce the
building’s location abutting the street edge and public space.
      14.   Use Of Customized Components: Prototype design for franchises,
formula or national chains shall use customized components consistent with the
design requirements for the HV Zone that reinforce visual consistency with
other buildings in the Holladay Village area.
   F.   Building Materials: Exterior finish materials selected should be part
of a strong architectural theme and should not appear as a material foreign to
the character of the building nor to the Holladay Village.
      1.   Building exteriors shall be constructed from high quality and
durable materials. It is important that the materials and colors will weather
well and need minimal maintenance.
         a.   Acceptable exterior finish materials include the following:
            (1)   Painted, stained, or weathered wood siding such as, 4-
S shingles, board and batten and clapboard.
            (2)   Artificial wood siding such as painted cementious fiberboard.
            (3)   Brick or natural stone.
            (4)   EIFS (synthetic stucco) (not more than 50 percent of all
exterior finished surfaces).
            (5)   Stucco.
            (6)   Synthetic stone.
            (7)   Architectural finish or decorative faced concrete masonry
units (CMUs).
         b.   Materials not listed above shall be prohibited unless determined
by the Design Review Board to be part of a strong architectural design theme
compatible with the Holladay Village Zone character.
      2.   No portion of a building constructed of standard CMUs shall be
visible from an existing public right of way. Exposed concrete walls shall be
architecturally treated. The enhancement must include joint treatments,
textured concrete such as exposed aggregate, sandblast and/or colored concrete,
or other decorative finishes.
      3.   Beveled metal siding, mirrored glass, vinyl siding, and backlit
awnings should not be used.
   G.   Roofs: The character of a roof is a major feature for a structure. The
roof pitch, its materials, size, and orientation are all distinct features that
contribute to the character of the building. Shadows created by the use of
traditional overhangs reduce the perception of a building’s scale. Roof designs
should relate to the building facade articulations.
      1.   A variety of roof types and configurations should be used to add
interest and reduce perceived building bulk.
      2.   Use of sidewalk porticoes and roof overhangs is encouraged.
      3.   Roof materials shall be in keeping with the character of the
building and not perceived as foreign to the chosen architectural style.
Recommended roof materials include slate shingles, asphalt and fiberglass
shingles, metal standing seam or tiles.
      4.   Crickets or other snow guard devices should be placed in such a way
that does not alter the form of the roof as seen from the street.
      5.   Decorative roof accessories may include cresting, ridge caps, and
finials or other similarly traditional architectural features..
   H.   Color:
      1.   A harmonious range of natural colors historically found within the
area should be used within the Holladay Village Zone.
      2.   Neon or very bright colors, which have the effect of unreasonably
setting the building apart from other adjacent buildings on the street, shall
not be used.
      3.   Bright colors shall be used only for trim and accents.
      4.   The Design Review Board may recommend approval of bright colors if
the use is consistent with the building design and other design requirements.
   I.   Amenities:
      1.   All major new construction involving combined uses of over seven
thousand (7,000) square feet of leasable area shall include at least two (2) of
the following amenities:
         a.   Plazas: Plazas should be designed as an outdoor room for use by
people as opposed to serving only as a setting for a building. Plazas should be
accessible from abutting sidewalks or pedestrian linkages. Plazas should be
located in sunny areas and provide plenty of seating on benches, steps and/or
ledges, public art, and other amenities.
         b.   Art: Art should be integrated with the public street
improvements. The location should provide for public view but not hinder
pedestrian traffic.
         c.   Water Feature: A water feature or fountain should be accessible
and/or visible by pedestrians from an abutting sidewalk or plaza. A water
feature shall be designed to use water efficiently with low water loss from
evaporation and wind.

13.72.010: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   The general purpose of the foothills and canyons overlay zone is to
promote the health, safety, and public welfare of the residents of the city,
and while being cognizant of private property rights, to preserve the natural
character of the foothills and canyons by establishing standards for foothill
and canyon development proposed in the city.
   B.   The standards for development contained herein are intended
specifically to accomplish the following purposes:
      1.   Preserve the visual and aesthetic qualities of the foothills and
canyons, including prominent ridgelines, which are vital to the attractiveness
and economic viability of the city;
      2.   Encourage development designed to reduce risks associated with
natural hazards and to provide maximum safety for inhabitants;
      3.   Provide adequate and safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation;
      4.   Encourage development that fits the natural slope of the land in
order to minimize the scarring and erosion effects of cutting, filling, and
grading related to construction on hillsides, ridgelines, and steep slopes;
      5.   Prohibit activities and uses that would result in degradation of
fragile soils, steep slopes, and water quality;
      6.   Provide for preservation of environmentally sensitive areas and open
space by encouraging clustering or other design techniques to preserve the
natural terrain, minimize disturbance to existing trees and vegetation,
preserve wildlife habitat, and protect aquifer recharge areas;
      7.   Reduce flooding by protecting streams, drainage channels, absorption
areas, and floodplains from substantial alteration of their natural functions.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.72.020: OVERLAY ZONE; SCOPE AND APPLICATION; GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Scope/Application:
      1.   Maps On File: Maps delineating the boundaries of the foothills and
canyons overlay zone are on file with the community development department.
Such maps, as amended, are a part of this title as if fully described and
detailed herein.
      2.   Applies To All Development: The standards and regulations contained
in this chapter shall apply to all development that occurs within the mapped
foothills and canyons overlay zone, as the term "development" is defined at
section
13.04.040 of this title, including grading, clearing and other land disturbance
activities.
      3.   Applicability To Development On Lots Of Record: The standards and
regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to all development that
occurs within the mapped foothills and canyons overlay zone on legally
subdivided lots that were recorded prior to the enactment of the ordinance
codified herein, including subsequent additions or expansions of buildings or
structures constructed prior to the enactment of said ordinance, except when a
waiver or exemption expressly allowed by this chapter has been granted.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   Construction And Rules Of Interpretation; Delegation Of Authority:
Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or another
officer or employee of the city to perform an act or duty, that provision shall
be construed as authorizing the department head or officer to delegate the
responsibility to subordinates, unless the terms of the provision specify
otherwise.
      2.   Recognition Of Salt Lake City Extraterritorial Jurisdiction: The
city recognizes that Salt Lake City has extraterritorial jurisdiction for
protection of its watershed located in the canyons east of Salt Lake City from
City Creek Canyon south to Little Cottonwood Canyon. All development in the
city that is also located within Salt Lake City's watershed areas shall be
reviewed by Salt Lake City for compliance with the city's applicable watershed
protection standards prior to city approval or final permitting. Maps
delineating the boundaries of Salt Lake City's watershed areas are on file with
the community development department. Such maps, as amended, are a part of this
title as if fully described and detailed herein.
      3.   Inconsistent Provisions: When the provisions of this chapter are
inconsistent with provisions found in other chapters of this title, or with
provisions found in any other city ordinance or regulation, the most
restrictive provision shall apply. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.72.030: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Lot And Density Requirements:
      1.   General Rule: All development in the foothills and canyons overlay
zone shall comply with the standards for minimum lot size, minimum lot width,
and maximum density required in the underlying zone.
      2.   Exception To General Rule; When Underlying Zone Permits Smaller Than
One Acre Lots:
         a.   Lots Created After The Effective Date Hereof: If the underlying
zone permits a minimum lot size of smaller than one acre, then the minimum lot
size for development in this overlay zone shall be one acre.
         b.   Lots Of Record That Meet Underlying Zone's Minimum Lot Size
Requirement: If the underlying zone permits a minimum lot size of smaller than
one acre, then a lot of record approved prior to the effective date hereof that
meets the minimum lot size requirement set forth in the underlying zone
district shall have a minimum lot size of one-half (1/2) acre.
      3.   Exception To General Rule; Lots Of Record That Do Not Meet The
Underlying Zone's Minimum Lot Requirements: If a lot of record subject to this
chapter:
         a.   Was approved prior to the effective date of said ordinance; and
         b.   Does not meet the minimum lot size or lot width requirements set
forth in the underlying zone district; and
         c.   Is not subject to the substandard lot consolidation provisions
set forth in subsection A4 of this section;
then the minimum lot size or lot width requirements shall be waived and
development may proceed on said lot of record subject to compliance with all
other applicable development standards set forth in this chapter and in the
underlying zone.
      4.   Consolidation Of Substandard Lots:
         a.   General Rule; Consolidation Required: Two (2) or more lots or
parcels located in the foothills and canyons overlay zone shall be considered
to be a single, undivided lot or parcel for the purposes of this chapter, if
all the following factors apply:
            (1)   The lots or parcels are contiguous;
            (2)   The lots or parcels are in single and common ownership and
are of record on the effective date of said ordinance;
            (3)   No structures are located on the lots or parcels;
            (4)   All or part of the lots or parcels do not meet the minimum
lot area or lot width requirements set forth in this section; and
            (5)   Such lots have not been improved with individual and separate
connections to municipal water or sewer systems.
No portion of such lots or parcels subject to this consolidation provision
shall be used or sold in a manner that renders compliance with the lot width
and lot area requirements set forth in this section less feasible.
         b.   Exception To General Rule: Notwithstanding the general rule for
consolidation set forth in subsection A4a of this section, if a lot or parcel
that would otherwise be subject to the general consolidation rule meets the
minimum lot area or lot width requirements set forth in the underlying zone
district, then consolidation shall not be required.
      5.   Clustering: Clustering of development (see section
13.72.080, figures 5 and 6 of this chapter) is generally recommended and may be
required by the planning commission to achieve the objectives of this chapter.
Whether proposed by an applicant or required by the planning commission,
clustering of development may only be used to reduce otherwise applicable
minimum lot size requirements upon satisfaction of the following findings:
         a.   The clustering proposal meets all other applicable requirements
set forth in this chapter or in other applicable ordinances or regulations;
         b.   The clustering proposal, compared with a more traditional site
development plan, better attains the policies and objectives of this chapter,
such as providing more open space, preserving existing trees and vegetation
coverage, and preserving sensitive environmental areas such as stream
corridors, slide areas, wetlands and steep slopes;
         c.   The clustering proposal will have no significant adverse impact
on adjacent properties or development, or, if such impacts would result, the
applicant has agreed to implement appropriate mitigation measures such as
landscaping, screening, illumination standards, and other design features as
recommended by the community development director to buffer and protect
adjacent properties from the proposed clustered development; and
         d.   The architecture, height, building materials, building colors,
and other design features of the development blend with the surrounding natural
landscape and are compatible with adjacent properties or development.
      6.   Density Bonus For Clustering:
         a.   A density bonus of up to twenty five percent (25%) over the base
density permitted in the underlying zone district may be available for cluster
developments that satisfy the above standards taking into account the bonus
density.
         b.   For purposes of calculating this twenty five percent (25%)
cluster density bonus, the base density permitted in the underlying zone
district shall be calculated based on "net developable acreage", which is
defined as land with all of the following:
            (1)   Average slope less than thirty percent (30%);
            (2)   Soils of a suitable depth and type based on soil exploration
and percolation tests in accordance with the regulations of the Utah department
of environmental quality in order to ensure against adverse impacts on surface
and ground water quality;
            (3)   Minimum distance from any "stream corridor", as that term is
defined in section
13.04.040 of this title of one hundred feet (100'); and
            (4)   Free from any identified natural hazards such as flood,
avalanche, landslide, high water table and similar features.
      7.   Planned Unit Developments:
         a.   Minimum Lot Area And Lot Width: Lot areas and lot widths for
planned unit developments in the foothills and canyons overlay zone district
shall not be subject to the minimum lot area and lot width limits set forth in
this section. Instead, minimum lot areas and lot widths shall be determined on
a case by case basis by the planning commission pursuant to
chapter 13.78 of this title.
         b.   Maximum Density: Density of dwelling units per acre in a planned
unit development shall be the same as that allowed in the underlying zone
district in which the planning unit development is located.
   B.   Slope Protection Standards:
      1.   Prohibition Of Development On Steep Slopes: No development,
including clearing, excavation, and grading shall be allowed on slopes greater
than thirty percent (30%), except as expressly allowed in this chapter.

ascending or descending slopes greater than thirty percent (30%) shall conform
to the requirements set forth in applicable building code provisions.
      3.   Prohibition Of Development On Designated Ridgelines:
         a.   Except when a waiver has been granted pursuant to this chapter,
no development shall intrude into any ridgeline protection area that has been
identified and designated as part of an adopted city plan or has been
identified and designated by the city during the development review and
approval process set forth in section
13.72.050 of this chapter.
         b.   For the purposes of this chapter, designated ridgeline protection
area shall consist of prominent ridgelines that are highly visible from public
rights of way or trails, and shall include the crest of any designated hill or
slope, plus the land located within one hundred feet (100') horizontally (map
distance) on either side of the crest. (See section
13.72.080, figures 3 and 4 of this chapter.)
      4.   Steep Slopes; Open Space: One hundred percent (100%) of areas with
slope greater than thirty percent (30%) shall remain in natural private or
public open space, except as expressly allowed in this chapter.
   C.   Grading Standards:
      1.   Grading Prohibited Without Prior Approvals/Permits: No grading,
excavation, or tree/vegetation removal shall be permitted, whether to provide
for a building site, for on site utilities or services, or for any roads or
driveways, prior to issuance of a building permit in accordance with a grading
and excavation plan and report for the site approved by the community
development director.
      2.   Cutting To Create Benches: Cutting and grading to create benches or
pads for additional or larger building sites shall be avoided to the maximum
extent feasible. (See section
13.72.080, figures 5 and 6 of this chapter.)
      3.   Limits On Changing Natural Grade: The original, natural grade of a
lot shall not be raised or lowered more than four feet (4') at any point for
construction of any structure or improvement, except:
         a.   The site's original grade may be raised or lowered six feet (6')
if a retaining wall is used to reduce the steepness of manmade slopes;
provided, that the retaining wall complies with the requirements set forth in
this section.
         b.   The site's original grade may be raised or lowered more than six
feet (6') with terracing, as specified in subsection C8b of this section.
      4.   Grading For Accessory Building Pads Discouraged: Separate building
pads for accessory buildings and structures other than garages, such as tennis
courts, swimming pools, outbuildings, and similar facilities, shall be
discouraged except where the natural slope is twenty percent (20%) or less.
      5.   Limits On Graded Or Filled Manmade Slopes:
         a.   Slopes of twenty five percent (25%) or less are greatly
encouraged wherever possible.
         b.   Graded or filled manmade slopes shall not exceed a slope of fifty
percent (50%).
         c.   Cut manmade surfaces or slopes shall not exceed a slope of fifty
percent (50%) unless it is substantiated, on the basis of a site investigation
and submittal of a soils engineering or geotechnical report prepared and
certified by a qualified professional, that a cut at a steeper slope will be
stable and will not create a hazard to public or private property.
         d.   All cut, filled, and graded slopes shall be recontoured to the
natural, varied contour of the surrounding terrain.
      6.   Revegetation Required: Any slope exposed or created in a new
development shall be landscaped or revegetated pursuant to the standards and
provisions of subsection H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this section.
      7.   Excavation: Excavation for footings and foundations shall be
minimized to the maximum extent feasible in order to lessen site disturbance
and ensure compatibility with hillside and sloped terrain. Intended excavation
must be supported by detailed engineering plans submitted as part of the
application for site development plan approval.
      8.   Retaining Walls: Use of retaining walls is encouraged to reduce the
steepness of manmade slopes and to provide planting pockets conducive to
revegetation. (See section
13.72.080, figure 7 of this chapter.)
         a.   Retaining walls may be permitted to support steep slopes but
shall not exceed six feet (6') in height from the finished grade, except where
terraced as specified in subsection C8b of this section.
         b.   Terracing shall be limited to two (2) tiers. The width of the
terrace between any two (2) 4-foot vertical retaining walls shall be at least
three feet (3'). Retaining walls higher than four feet (4') shall be separated
from any other retaining wall by a minimum of five (5) horizontal feet.
Terraces created between retaining walls shall be permanently landscaped or
revegetated pursuant to subsection H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this
section.
         c.   Retaining walls shall be faced with stone or earth colored
materials similar to the surrounding natural landscape. (See
chapter 13.73, "Foothills And Canyons Site Development And Design Standards",
of this title.)
         d.   All retaining walls shall comply with the international building
code, except that when any provision of this section conflicts with any
provision set forth in the international building code, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
      9.   Filling Or Dredging Of Waterways Prohibited: Filling or dredging of
watercourses, wetlands, bullies, streambeds, or stormwater runoff channels is
prohibited, except that bridge construction is allowed pursuant to the
standards set forth in subsection J7 of this section.
      10.   Detention/Stormwater Facilities: Where detention basins and other
storm and erosion control facilities may be required, any negative visual and
aesthetic impacts on the natural landscape and topography shall be minimized to
the maximum extent feasible. (See section
13.72.080, figures 8 and 9 of this chapter.)
   D.   Streets/Roads And General Site Access: (See subsection E of this
section regarding driveway standards.)
      1.   Access to a building or development site shall be by road, street,
or private access road only.
      2.   Streets, roads, private access roads, and other vehicular routes
shall not be allowed to cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty
percent (50%) unless specifically authorized by the planning commission, upon
the favorable recommendation of the community development director, after
finding that all of the following conditions and constraints are applicable:
         a.   No alternate location for access is feasible or available;
         b.   No individual segment or increment of the street, road, private
access road, or other vehicular route that will cross slopes between thirty
percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%) exceeds one hundred feet (100') in
length;
         c.   The cumulative length of individual segments or increments that
will cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%) does not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the total length of the street, road, private
access road, or other vehicular route; and
         d.   No significant adverse visual, environmental, or safety impacts
will result from the crossing, either by virtue of the design and construction
of the street, road, private access road, or other vehicular route as
originally proposed or as a result of incorporation of remedial improvements
provided by the developer to mitigate such impact.
      3.   Under no circumstances shall any street, road, private access road,
or other vehicular route cross slopes greater than fifty percent (50%).
      4.   Streets, roads, private access roads, and other vehicular routes
shall to the maximum extent feasible follow natural contour lines. (See section
13.72.080, figures 10 and 11 of this chapter.)
      5.   Grading for streets, roads, private access roads, and other
vehicular routes shall be limited to the cartway portion of the right of way,
plus up to an additional ten feet (10') on either side of the cartway as
needed, except that when developing access on slopes in excess of twenty five
percent (25%), only the cartway right of way shall be graded plus the minimum
area required for any necessary curb, gutter, or sidewalk improvements. The
remainder of the access right of way shall be left undisturbed to the maximum
extent feasible.
      6.   Roads, other vehicular routes, or trails may be required to provide
access or maintain existing access to adjacent lands for vehicles, pedestrians,
emergency services, and essential service and maintenance equipment.
   E.   Driveways: Driveways shall be provided to ensure safe, convenient, and
adequate access to individual buildings. Driveway access to a development shall
be consistent with the city general plan and highway plan, as amended. In
addition, provision of driveway access is subject to the following
requirements:
      1.   All driveways shall comply with the city highway and fire department
ordinances.
      2.   Driveways longer than one hundred fifty feet (150') in length shall
meet the following requirements:
         a.   Provision of a turnaround that meets the city road/street and
fire department standards; and
         b.   Provision of an adequate number of spaces turnouts along the
length of the driveway, as determined by the community development director in
consultation with the city's service providers.
      3.   Driveways longer than fifty feet (50') in length shall not be
allowed to cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%)
unless specifically authorized by the planning commission, upon the favorable
recommendation of the community development director, after finding that all of
the following conditions and constraints are applicable:
         a.   No alternate location for access is feasible or available;
         b.   No individual segment or increment of the driveway that will
cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent (50%) exceeds one
hundred feet (100') in length;
         c.   The cumulative length of individual segments or increments of the
driveway that will cross slopes between thirty percent (30%) and fifty percent
(50%) does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the driveway's total length; and
         d.   No significant adverse visual, environmental, or safety impacts
will result from the driveway crossing, either as originally proposed or as a
result of incorporation of remedial improvements provided by the developer to
mitigate such impacts.
      4.   Under no circumstance shall any driveway cross slopes greater than
fifty percent (50%).
      5.   Driveways shall, to the maximum extent feasible, follow natural
contour lines. (See section
13.72.080, figures 10 and 11 of this chapter.)
      6.   Driveways may be shared by no more than two (2) residential units,
or by two (2) or more principal nonresidential uses, provided such
nonresidential uses together do not exceed a total of twenty five thousand
(25,000) square feet of gross floor area. Shared driveways are greatly
encouraged.
      7.   Driveways to a building site shall have direct access to a public
street or to a private right of way approved by the planning commission.
Finished driveway grades shall comply with the following:
         a.   Driveways shall have a maximum grade of twelve percent (12%), or
as determined by the community development director on a case by case basis
based on health and safety concerns and the need for adequate access for city
service providers. In no case, however, shall the community development
director approve a maximum grade greater than fifteen percent (15%). Driveways
shall have a maximum grade of fifteen percent (15%).
         b.   Driveway grades within twenty feet (20') of the roadway shall not
exceed ten percent (10%). (See highway ordinance.)
   F.   Trail Access:
      1.   Dedication Required: For the purpose of providing trails necessary
for public access to public lands or trails shown on the city general plan, the
Salt Lake County regional trail plan, and the Salt Lake County trail access
plan, all development in the foothills and canyons overlay zone shall be
required to offer a dedication of an amount of land that is roughly
proportional to the demand for open space, recreational facilities, trails, or
public access to public lands or trails generated by the proposed development.
The city shall have the sole option whether to accept a reasonable money fee in
lieu of land dedication.
      2.   Verification Required: All land offered for dedication for trails or
public access to trails shall be verified on the ground by the community
development department before approval of the site plan. Land offered for
dedication for trails shall be located so that:
         a.   Proposed trail construction and maintenance is feasible; and
         b.   Side slopes do not exceed seventy percent (70%); and
         c.   Rock cliffs and other insurmountable physical obstructions are
avoided.
The city shall have the sole option of rejecting the applicant's offered land
dedication and instead select more suitable land; based on the above factors,
applicable plans, opportunities to link to existing or planned trails and
public lands, and/or suitability of the terrain for trail use.
      3.   Nature Of Interest Dedicated: At the city's sole option, dedications
for trails or public access may be of a fee or less than fee interest to either
the city, another unit of government, or nonprofit land conservation
organization approved by the city.
      4.   Bonus Density Allowed For Certain Dedications: The planning
commission may allow up to twenty five percent (25%) of the maximum allowable
density attributable to areas of the site with greater than thirty percent
(30%) slope to be transferred to the developable areas of the site if the
applicant shows that the offered dedication is beyond what would be roughly
proportional to the demand for such trails or trail access generated by the
proposed development. The planning commission may reduce the applicable minimum
lot area requirement within the site's developable area if necessary to
accommodate the transferred density.
      5.   Liability Releases: Liability releases related to dedicated lands
shall be prepared for a landowner in accord with the state landowner liability
act of 1987, as amended.
   G.   Fences:
      1.   No fence shall be constructed or installed unless shown on the
approved site development plan.
      2.   No fence shall be constructed or installed outside the designated
limits of disturbance on a site, except as required by the city (such as fenced
corrals for horses or other animals) or along property boundaries. (See section
13.72.080, figure 12 of this chapter.)
      3.   Fences in the front yards and along roadways shall not exceed forty
two inches (42") in height.
      4.   Fences in identified wildlife corridors shall be strongly
discouraged, but in no case shall exceed forty two inches (42") in height.
      5.   Fences shall conform to the standards set forth in
chapter 13.73 of this title, foothills and canyons development standards.
   H.   Tree And Vegetation Protection: (See section
13.72.080, figure 13 of this chapter.)
      1.   Purposes: Protection of existing tree and vegetation cover is
intended to:
         a.   Preserve the visual and aesthetic qualities of the city's
foothills and canyons;
         b.   Encourage site design techniques that preserve the natural
environment and enhance the developed environment;
         c.   Control erosion, slippage, and sediment runoff into streams and
waterways;
         d.   Increase slope stability;
         e.   Protect wildlife habitat and migration corridors; and
         f.   Conserve energy, in proximity to structures, by reducing building
heating and cooling costs.
      2.   Application And Exemptions: The provisions of this section shall
apply to all development on real property that is located in the foothills and
canyons overlay zone, except that the following developments and activities
shall be exempt from this section:
         a.   The removal of dead or naturally fallen trees or vegetation, or
such that the city finds to be a threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare;
         b.   The selective and limited removal of trees or vegetation
necessary to obtain clear visibility at driveways, intersections, or for the
purpose of performing authorized field survey work;
         c.   The removal of trees or vegetation on land zoned or lawfully used
for agricultural and forestry activities, including tree farms and approved
forestry management practices. In the event a site is substantially cleared of
trees pursuant to such legitimate activities, however, no development or site
plan applications for other types of development shall be accepted by the city
for thirty six (36) months from the date the clearing is completed.
      3.   Tree/Vegetation Removal:
         a.   Outside Limits Of Disturbance: No trees or vegetation shall be
removed outside the approved limits of disturbance except as specifically
exempted in this section or chapter.
         b.   Within Limits Of Disturbance: "Significant trees", as defined in
section
13.04.040 of this title, removed from within the limits of disturbance shall be
replaced as set forth in subsection H4 of this section.
         c.   Wildfire Hazards And Tree/Vegetation Removal: In areas determined
by fire prevention officials as being highly susceptible to fire hazards,
vegetation up to thirty feet (30') from the perimeter of a structure shall be
selectively pruned and thinned for fire protection purposes.
         d.   Tree/Vegetation Removal For Views Prohibited: No trees or
vegetation shall be removed for the purpose of providing open views to or from
structures on a site.
      4.   Replacement Of Significant Trees: When a "significant tree" or
trees, as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title, are removed from either inside or outside the
established limits of disturbance, the applicant or developer shall replace
such trees on the lot, either inside or outside the established limits of
disturbance, according to the following schedule and requirements:
         a.   A significant deciduous tree that is removed shall be replaced by
three (3) trees with a minimum size of two and one-half inch (21/2") caliper.
         b.   A significant coniferous tree that is removed shall be replaced
by two (2) trees with a minimum height of eight feet (8').
         c.   Acceptable replacement trees shall be determined by a person or
firm qualified by training or experience to have expert knowledge of the
subject.
         d.   Replacement trees shall be maintained through an establishment
period of at least three (3) years, except that single-family dwellings shall
have an applicable establishment period of only one year. The applicant shall
post an improvement warranty bond for all public street trees guaranteeing the
survival and health of all replacement street trees during the establishment
period.
      5.   Revegetation And Land Reclamation Plan:
         a.   On a parcel of land that has been or will be altered from its
natural condition by manmade activities, a revegetation and land reclamation
plan prepared and certified by a qualified professional may be required for
review and approval by the community development director.
         b.   The revegetation and land reclamation plan shall depict the type,
size, and location of any vegetation and trees being planted and illustrate how
the site will be recontoured in such a fashion and with sufficient topsoil to
ensure that revegetation is feasible.
         c.   Any slope exposed or created in new development shall be
landscaped or revegetated with native or adopted trees and other native or
adopted plant material. New vegetation shall be equivalent to or exceed the
amount and erosion control characteristics of the original vegetation cover in
order to mitigate adverse environmental and visual effects.
         d.   On manmade slopes of twenty five percent (25%) or greater, plant
materials with deep rooting characteristics shall be selected that will
minimize erosion and reduce surface runoff. The planting basin should be kept
level with a raised berm around the base of the plant to help retain moisture.
         e.   To the maximum extent feasible, topsoil that is removed during
construction shall be conserved for later use on areas requiring revegetation
or landscaping, such as cut and fill slopes.
         f.   The plan shall also indicate a time frame for revegetation that
is acceptable to the city and that takes into account optimal seasonal growing
conditions.
      6.   Tree/Vegetation Protection During Construction And Grading
Activities:
         a.   Limits of disturbance as established in accordance with the
provisions of section
13.72.040 of this chapter shall be shown on the final plans for development and
shall be clearly delineated on site with fencing or other materials or methods
approved by the community development director prior to the commencement of
excavation, grading, or construction activities on the site.
         b.   Within the limits of disturbance, fencing, at a minimum, should
be placed around each significant tree and around stands of twelve (12) or more
smaller trees a distance equal to the size of the individual or outermost
tree's drip zone. (See section
13.04.040 of this title, significant trees.)
            (1)   For purposes of this subsection, the drip zone is calculated
by measuring the diameter of the tree at breast height. Every inch of tree
trunk diameter, for example, equates to one foot (1') of drip zone.
            (2)   No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or
any other activity shall be allowed within this area, and the fencing shall
remain in place until all land alteration, construction, and development
activities are completed.
         c.   If it is necessary to fill over the root zone, compacted soils
shall be avoided by sandwiching fabric, rocks and more fabric under the area to
be filled.
         d.   Fill placed directly on the roots shall not exceed a maximum of
six inches (6") in depth.
         e.   If fill creates a tree well or depression around a tree or
shrubs, such area shall be drained so that the vegetation is not drowned by the
pooling of rainfall or irrigation.
         f.   If a tree's roots must be cut, the branches shall be trimmed by
an amount equal to the percent of roots that were lost. Roots shall be pruned
cleanly prior to digging and not ripped off by heavy equipment. Cutting more
than thirty percent (30%) of the roots endangers the health of the tree, and
over forty percent (40%) affects the tree's stability.
         g.   Utility trenches near trees should be avoided. If a line must be
near a tree, tunneling, auguring, or other mitigation measures shall be used.
   I.   Natural Hazards: All development in the foothills and canyons overlay
zone shall comply with the requirements and standards set forth in
chapter 13.75, "Natural Hazard Areas", of this title. A natural hazards report
required by
chapter 13.75 of this title may be combined with any of the plans and reports
required by the provisions of this chapter, including geotechnical, slope, and
grading reports. The city may have a geologist review all natural hazards
reports and submit his recommendations in writing to the community development
director or planning commission prior to final action on the site plan for
development.
   J.   Stream Corridor And Wetlands Protection:
      1.   Purposes: The following requirements and standards are intended to
promote, preserve, and enhance the important hydrologic, biological,
ecological, aesthetic, recreational, and educational functions that stream
corridors, associated riparian areas, and wetlands provide.
      2.   Boundary Delineation: Unless previously delineated by the city,
boundaries for stream corridors and wetland areas shall be delineated according
to the following provisions:
         a.   Stream corridor and wetland area delineation shall be performed
by a qualified professional that has demonstrated experience necessary to
conduct site analysis. Delineations shall be subject to the approval of the
community development director.
         b.   Stream corridors shall be delineated at the "ordinary high water
mark", as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title. Stream corridors shall not include ephemeral streams
or ditches that are commonly known to be irrigation ditches and that do not
contribute to irrigation ditches and that do not contribute to the preservation
and enhancement of fisheries or wildlife.
         c.   Boundary delineation of wetlands shall be established using the
federal manual for identifying and delineating jurisdictional wetlands, dated
January 10, 1989, and jointly published by the U.S. environmental protection
agency, the U.S. fish and wildlife service, the U.S. army corps of engineers,
and the U.S. soil conservation service. Subsequent revisions of the federal
manual shall not be incorporated into this delineation methodology. Although
the federal manual may change in the future, the city will use this referenced
manual as a basis for wetland determination.
      3.   Prohibited Activities: No person shall engage in any activity that
will disturb, remove, fill, dredge, clear, destroy, or alter any area,
including vegetation, within stream corridors, wetlands, and their setbacks as
set forth below, except as may be expressly allowed in this chapter.
      4.   Minimum Setbacks: Except where Salt Lake City, pursuant to its
recognized extraterritorial jurisdiction, has defined a greater setback from
watershed resources (including stream corridors and wetland areas), the
following minimum setbacks shall be required:
         a.   Stream Corridors: All buildings, accessory structures, leach
fields, and parking lots shall be set back at least one hundred feet (100')
horizontally (plan view) from the ordinary high water mark of stream corridors.
(See section
13.72.080, figure 14 of this chapter.)
         b.   Wetlands: All buildings, accessory structures, leach fields, and
parking areas or lots shall be set back at least fifty thousand feet (50,000')
horizontally (map distance), from the delineated edge of a wetland.
         c.   Open Space/Landscaping Credit For Setback Areas: All setback
areas shall be credited toward any relevant private open space or landscaping
requirements, but shall not be credited toward trail access dedication
requirements.
      5.   Ephemeral Streams; Prohibited Activities: Development shall not be
permitted within the channel of an ephemeral stream, as defined by its ordinary
high water mark, except that the planning commission upon the recommendation of
the community development director may grant waivers or modifications from this
prohibition upon a finding that the development will have no adverse
environmental impacts, or that such impacts will be substantially mitigated.
      6.   Preservation Of Vegetation: All existing vegetation within the
stream corridor or wetland setback area shall be preserved, and where necessary
to provide adequate screening or to repair damaged riparian areas, supplemented
with additional native or adopted planting and landscaping.
      7.   Bridges: The construction of bridges over a stream corridor and
within the stream setback area is permitted, provided such bridges are planned
and constructed so as to minimize impacts on the stream corridor. (See section
13.72.080, figure 15 of this chapter and subsection
13.73.080C of this title, bridges for stream crossings.)
   K.   Wildlife Habitat Protection:
      1.   Intent And Purpose: The city finds that its foothills and canyon
areas provide important wildlife habitat for a wide variety of animal and bird
species. As a result of past development activities, many habitat areas have
been significantly impaired, altered, fragmented, and in some cases destroyed.
In combination with the tree/vegetation and stream corridor/wetlands protection
standards set forth above, the following requirements have been developed to
promote and preserve valuable wildlife habitats and to protect them from
adverse effects and potentially irreversible impacts.
      2.   Applicability: The requirements of this subsection shall apply to
development on real property in the foothills and canyons overlay zone that
contains wildlife habitats designated as "critical summer/winter [value] use",
as shown on the city wildlife habitat maps, as amended, on file with the
community development department.
      3.   Development Limitations In Areas Of Critical Habitat: All
development subject to this subsection shall, to the maximum extent feasible,
incorporate the following principles in establishing the limits of disturbance
and siting buildings, structures, roads, trails, and other similar facilities:
         a.   Maintain buffers between areas dominated by human activities and
core areas of wildlife habitat, with more intense human activities, such as
automobile and pedestrian traffic, relegated to more distant zones away from
the core habitat. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
         b.   Facilitate wildlife movement across areas dominated by human
activities by:
            (1)   Maintaining connections between open space parcels on
adjacent parcels; (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
            (2)   Locating roads and recreational trails away from natural
travel corridors used by wildlife such as riparian areas;
            (3)   Minimizing fencing types that inhibit the movement of
wildlife species; and
            (4)   Minimizing the visual contrast between human dominated areas,
including individual lots, and less disturbed terrain in surrounding areas (for
example, by retaining or planting native vegetation and trees around a house or
accessory structure).
         c.   Mimic features of the local natural landscape in developed areas
by:
            (1)   Retaining predevelopment, high quality habitat to the maximum
extent feasible, including large patches of natural, vegetated areas that have
not yet been fragmented by roads or residential development;
            (2)   Minimizing levels of disturbance to trees, the understory,
and other structural landscape features during construction;
            (3)   Designing house lots in a fashion consistent with local
natural habitats, for example, by preserving and landscaping with natural,
native vegetation; and
            (4)   Enhancing the habitat value of degraded predevelopment
landscapes with selective plantings.
      4.   Referral Requirements And Planning Commission Action:
         a.   Site development plan applications subject to this subsection
shall be referred to the Utah division of wildlife resources for review,
comment, and recommendations. The Utah division of wildlife resources' comments
and recommendations shall be incorporated into the staff report or in some
other way transmitted in writing to the community development director (for
permitted uses) or to the planning commission (for conditional uses and
subdivisions) prior to final action on submitted proposals.
         b.   The community development director and planning commission shall
give special consideration to wildlife habitats that are determined by the Utah
division of wildlife resources in their review to be of unique or critical
value, and may require project modifications or special conditions recommended
to mitigate impacts on critical wildlife habitat.
         c.   The planning commission may deny a development proposal if it
finds that the proposed development will have significant adverse impacts on
critical wildlife habitat that cannot be adequately mitigated.
            (1)   Permitted Uses: If the community development director finds
that a proposal for a permitted use may have significant adverse impacts on
critical wildlife habitat that cannot be adequately mitigated, the site
development plan shall be referred to the planning commission for final action.
            (2)   Definition: For purposes of this subsection, "significant
adverse impact on critical wildlife habitat" means elimination, reduction, and/
or fragmentation of wildlife habitat to the point that viability of an
individual species is threatened in the city and the diversity of wildlife
species occurring in the city is reduced.
   L.   Site Development And Design Standards: In addition to the development
standards set forth in this section, all residential and commercial development
within the foothills and canyons overlay zone shall comply with the development
design standards set forth in
chapter 13.73, "Foothills And Canyons Site Development And Design Standards",
of this title. To the extent that standards in
chapter 13.73 of this title conflict with the requirements set forth in this
chapter, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
   M.   Traffic:
      1.   Impact Study Required: Unless waived, a traffic and parking impact
study shall be required as part of the site development plan application for
the following developments in the foothills and canyons overlay zone:
         a.   All residential development that creates a projected increase in
traffic volumes equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of current road/
street capacity as determined by the community development director.
         b.   All nonresidential development that creates a projected increase
in traffic volumes equal to or greater than fifty (50) trip ends per peak hour.
         c.   All development that affects a roadway identified by the
community development director as having an unacceptable level of service
(LOC).
      2.   Impact Study; Contents: A traffic and parking impact study shall
address, at a minimum, the items specified in the submittal requirements for
development proposals in the foothills and canyons overlay zone, which document
is incorporated by reference.
      3.   Standard Of Review: All development subject to this subsection shall
demonstrate that the peak hour levels of service on adjacent roadways and as
impacted intersections after development shall comply with the city's current
transportation and impact mitigation policies.
      4.   Access Management Plan Required: All development required by this
subsection to submit an impact study shall also provide an overall access
management plan to ensure free flowing access to the site and avoid congestion
and unsafe conditions on adjacent public roads and streets. The access
management plan shall be combined with the required traffic and parking impact
study. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-10, 9-7-2023)
13.72.040: ESTABLISHMENT OF LIMITS OF DISTURBANCE:
   A.   Establishment Of Limits Of Disturbance: For every development subject
to this chapter, the community development director shall establish "limits of
disturbance" that indicate the specific areas of a site in which construction
and development activity must be contained. For single-family residential
development, limits of disturbance shall include that area required for the
principal structure, an accessory structure, utilities, services, drainage
facilities, and a septic tank. Areas required for driveways and leach fields
are not included. (See section
13.72.080, figures 16 through 18 of this chapter.)
   B.   Criteria For Establishing Limits Of Disturbance: In establishing limits
of disturbance, the following criteria and standards shall be considered and
applied:
      1.   Minimize visual impacts from the development, including, but not
limited to, screening from adjacent and downhill properties, ridgeline area
protection, and protection of scenic views;
      2.   Erosion prevention and control, including, but not limited to,
protection of steep slopes and natural drainage channels (see subsections
13.72.030B, "Slope Protection Standards", and 13.72.030L, "Site Development And
Design Standards", of this chapter);
      3.   Fire prevention and safety, including, but not limited to, location
of trees and vegetation near structures (see subsection
13.72.030H3 of this chapter, wildfire hazards and tree/vegetation removal);
      4.   Preservation of significant trees or vegetation (see subsection
13.72.030H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this chapter);
      5.   Conservation of water, including, but not limited to, preservation
of existing native vegetation, reduction in amounts of irrigated areas, and
similar considerations;
      6.   Wildlife habitat protection, including, but not limited to,
preservation of critical wildlife habitat and identified migration corridors
and routes (see subsection
13.72.030K, "Wildlife Habitat Protection", of this chapter);
      7.   Stream corridor and wetland protection and buffering (see subsection
13.72.030J, "Stream Corridor And Wetlands Protection", of this chapter);
      8.   Preservation of the maximum amount of the site's natural topography,
tree cover, and vegetation.
   C.   Zero Lot Lines Allowed: Where appropriate to preserve or to protect
steep slopes or other natural features, a structure may be located on a lot in
such a manner that one or both of the side facades of a structure rest directly
on a lot line. This provision shall not be interpreted to exempt a structure
from any applicable building and fire code provisions or requirements.
   D.   Limits Of Disturbance May Be Noncontiguous: Limits of disturbance
necessary to accommodate proposed development may be noncontiguous in order to
best meet the criteria and standards set forth in this section. (See section
13.72.080, figures 16 through 18 of this chapter.)
   E.   Clustering: Clustering of building pads and parking areas within a
building site is strongly encouraged and may be required to minimize the size
of the limits of disturbance and to maintain the maximum amount of open space
in the development. (See section
13.72.080, figures 17 and 18 of this chapter.)
   F.   Maximum Limits Of Disturbance:
      1.   Single-Family Residential Uses: For lots or parcels less than one
acre in size, the limits of disturbance for an individual single-family use and
any accessory structure shall not exceed ten thousand (10,000) square feet,
unless:
         a.   Significant existing site vegetation is retained; or
         b.   Remedial revegetation and land reclamation improvements which
substantially advance the purposes of this chapter have been proposed and will
be implemented on the site in accordance with a revegetation and land
reclamation plan reviewed and approved by the community development director.
In such cases, the limits of disturbance for lots or parcels less than one acre
in size may be increased up to but not to exceed fifteen thousand (15,000)
square feet.
For lots or parcels one acre in size or greater, the limits of disturbance for
an individual single-family use and any accessory structure shall not exceed
twelve thousand (12,000) square feet unless the aforementioned conditions
(retention of significant existing site vegetation or submittal and
implementation of an approved revegetation and land reclamation plan) are
provided, in which case the limits of disturbance may be increased up to but
not to exceed eighteen thousand (18,000) square feet.
      2.   All Other Land Uses: The maximum limits of disturbance, including
parking areas and accessory buildings and structures, shall be determined on a
case by case basis. Areas for leach fields constructed in connection with an on
site sewer system shall not be included in the determination of limits of
disturbance, but must be revegetated with native vegetation in accordance with
state regulations for individual wastewater systems. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.72.050: APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOOTHILLS AND CANYONS
OVERLAY ZONE:
   A.   Purposes: The purpose of the approval procedures set forth in this
section is to ensure compliance with the land use standards and provisions of
this chapter and all other applicable ordinances and codes, while encouraging
quality development in the foothills and canyons reflective of the city's
goals, policies, and objectives set forth in this chapter, and the city general
plan.
   B.   Applicability: All development proposed in the foothills and canyons
overlay zone is subject to the site development plan approval procedures set
forth in this section. No development or construction activity, including tree/
vegetation removal and grading, or subdivision of land, shall occur on property
subject to this chapter until a site development plan has been approved.

modifications and conditions of approval as may be necessary to incorporate
into the development to bring it into full compliance, if possible, with
applicable code and ordinance requirements and to mitigate identified impacts.
Inability to achieve compliance with applicable standards and criteria shall
warrant denial of the proposal as submitted.
         a.   Technical And Outside Agency Assistance: In making a
determination on a site development plan application, the community development
director may seek technical and policy recommendations from other public
agencies with legal jurisdiction over matters affecting or affected by the
proposed development, such as, but not limited to, the health department; Utah
division of wildlife resources; Utah division of forestry, fire and state
lands; U.S. forest services; and U.S. soil conservation services.
         b.   Failure Not Deemed Approval: Failure to complete and document the
assessment process regarding the development's compliance with applicable
regulations and standards shall not be deemed to be approval.
      4.   Community Development Director Consideration And Action On Site

planning commission may require as a condition of preliminary approval that a
site development plan application be brought back before the commission for
final consideration and approval.
   E.   Standards For Review: The following standards shall be utilized in the
consideration of and subsequent action on applications for site development
plan review and approval. Failure to comply with any of the following shall
constitute sufficient grounds for denial of a development subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      1.   The development shall be consistent with the purposes and intent of
this chapter, and with the policies, goals, and objectives of any applicable
plan, including the city general plan, the county regional trails plan, as such
plans are amended from time to time;
      2.   The development complies with the requirements set forth in section
13.72.030, "Development Standards", of this chapter, except to the extent
modifications and waivers have been expressly granted;
      3.   The development complies with all applicable development
regulations, standards, requirements, or plans adopted by the state, including,
but not limited to, water quality and wastewater regulations;
      4.   Construction, grading, and development activities are restricted to
limits of disturbance that comply with the standards and criteria set forth in
section
13.72.040, "Establishment Of Limits Of Disturbance", of this chapter.
   F.   Time Limit And Effect Of Site Development Plan Approval:
      1.   Construction In Compliance With Approved Site Development Plan And
Conditions Of Approval Required: A building permit issued pursuant to this site
development plan approval process must reference all conditions or stipulations
applicable to such approval. All development, construction, and use shall be in
accordance with the approved site development plan.
      2.   Valid For Two Years: An approved site development plan shall be
valid for a period of twenty four (24) months from the date of the community
development director's or planning commission's action granting final approval.
      3.   Issuance Of Building Permit Within Two Year Period: A building
permit may be obtained at any time within the twenty four (24) month period. If
a building permit is not timely issued within the two (2) year period, approval
of the site plan shall automatically lapse and be null and void.
      4.   Extensions Of Time:
         a.   Phasing: A building permit issued for any phase of a development
that has received site development plan approval pursuant to this chapter shall
extend the life of the site development plan for the entire development for an
additional twenty four (24) months from the date of issuance of the building
permit. If any successive twenty four (24) month period expires before a
building permit is issued for a subsequent phase or phases, then the site
development plan approval shall automatically lapse and be null and void as to
all undeveloped or unbuilt phases of the development.
         b.   Other Extensions: A twelve (12) month extension of the life of
the site development plan may be obtained subject to paying an extension fee
equal to one times the original filing fee for the site plan application. (Ord.
2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-18, 8-5-2021)
13.72.060: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Waiver Of Slope Protection Standards For Lots Of Record:
      1.   Subject to the conditions set forth in subsection A2 of this
section, the planning commission may waive or modify the following standards as
applied to development on lots of record and in subdivisions that were approved
prior to the effective date hereof:
         a.   Slope protection standards regarding prohibition of development
on slopes greater than thirty percent (30%) or in ridgeline protection areas,
as set forth in subsection
13.72.030B of this chapter; or
         b.   Limitations on the crossing of slopes greater than thirty percent
(30%) with any street, road, private access road or other vehicular route, as
addressed in subsections
13.72.030D3 and D4 of this chapter.
      2.   The planning commission may waive or modify the aforementioned
standards only upon substantiation of compliance with the following findings:
         a.   Strict compliance with the slope protection standards in
subsection
13.72.030B or 13.72.030D3 and D4 of this chapter would render the site
completely undevelopable; or
         b.   Strict compliance with the slope protection standards in
subsection
13.72.030B or 13.72.030D3 and D4 of this chapter would result in a substantial
economic hardship, not created by the applicant or otherwise self-imposed; and
         c.   The development conforms with all other development, site design,
and environmental standards set forth in this chapter, in
chapter 13.73, "Foothills And Canyons Site Development And Design Standards",
of this title and in all other applicable ordinances and codes.
      3.   Notwithstanding its discretion to grant waivers for lots of record
from the slope protection standards set forth in this chapter, in no case shall
the planning commission permit development other than roads on slopes greater
than forty percent (40%).
      4.   In granting a waiver from or modification of the slope and ridgeline
protection standards set forth in subsection
13.72.030B of this chapter, the planning commission may impose such conditions
as are reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the impacts of the proposed
development on adjacent properties and area characteristics. Such conditions
may include, for example, but are not limited to, a reduction in the maximum
building height otherwise permitted by the underlying zone (e.g., a reduction
to 20 feet from the 30 feet maximum building height permitted in the FR zone).
   B.   Administrative Modification Of Standards Allowed: In establishing the
limits of disturbance for developments subject to this chapter, the community
development director shall have the discretion to modify the following
development standards up to a maximum of twenty five percent (25%), or greater
if specifically permitted by this subsection.
      1.   Minimum lot area requirements, as set forth in subsection
13.72.030A of this chapter. Additionally, modifications of greater than twenty
five percent (25%) may be approved by the planning commission pursuant to the
clustering provisions of subsection
13.72.030A5 of this chapter;
      2.   Driveway access standards, as set forth in subsection
13.72.030E of this chapter;
      3.   Tree and vegetation protection standards, as set forth in subsection
13.72.030H of this chapter;
      4.   Perennial stream corridor and wetlands setbacks, as set forth in
subsection
13.72.030J of this chapter and subsection
13.73.080B of this title, except that greater modifications may be permitted as
follows:
         a.   Modifications of up to fifty percent (50%) may be allowed where
strict application of these setback standards would render a site
undevelopable, provided that all other federal, state, and city laws are
complied with.
         b.   For renovations, alterations, or expansions of a building or
structure legally existing on the effective date hereof, modifications
exceeding twenty five percent (25%) of the required stream corridor setback may
be allowed by the planning commission, provided the applicant shows the
following:
            (1)   No alternative location for the development that is further
from the stream is feasible or available; and
            (2)   The renovation, alternation, or expansion does not increase
the gross floor area of the original, existing building or structure by more
than fifty percent (50%); and
            (3)   The applicant shows that creative architectural or
environmental solutions can be applied and used to achieve the purposes of
stream corridor protection as set forth in this chapter.
      5.   Site and building design standards, as set forth in subsection
13.72.030L of this chapter. The community development director may only modify
the aforementioned standards upon substantiation of compliance with the
following findings:
         a.   Strict application of the standards would render a site
undevelopable; or
         b.   Modification would result in less visual impact, more effective
preservation of existing mature trees, vegetation and riparian areas, or
protection of wildlife habitat.
In no case shall the modification cause the maximum limits of disturbance set
forth in subsection
13.72.040F of this chapter to be exceeded. Appeals of decisions on
modifications shall be addressed as set forth in
chapter 13.09 of this title, as applicable.
   C.   Violations/Penalties For Unauthorized Land Disturbance And Tree/
Vegetation Removal: Any applicant, whether as principal, agent, employee, or
other, who violates the provisions of this chapter by removing trees or
vegetation or exceeding the prescribed limits of disturbance shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and punishable as provided by law and/or shall be subject to
civil penalties as provided by law. Such applicant who violates this chapter
shall be deemed to be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day
during which any violation of this chapter is committed, continued, or
permitted by such person. In addition, any applicant violating the provisions
of this chapter shall replace all trees/vegetation illegally removed pursuant
to the standards set forth in subsection
13.72.030H of this chapter.

13.73.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The general purpose of these standards is to promote development that
will balance the rights of the landowner with protection of the city's
sensitive lands, especially its irreplaceable foothill and canyon environments.
Many of these standards are broad in nature to allow flexibility in design so
development can be evaluated on a site by site basis, while ensuring that
development will be comparable with the natural landscape, and consistent with
the public welfare.
   B.   The development standards contained herein are intended specifically to
accomplish the following purposes:
      1.   Preserve and enhance the beauty of the landscape by encouraging the
maximum retention of natural topographic features, such as drainage swales,
streams, slopes, ridgelines, rock outcroppings, vistas, natural plant
formations, trees, and similar features;
      2.   Encouraging planning, design, and development of building sites in a
manner that provides the maximum in safety and enjoyment while adapting
development to, and taking advantage of, the best use of natural terrain;
      3.   Establish a foundation for development in sensitive lands to ensure
a more harmonious relationship between manmade structures and the natural
setting;
      4.   Direct new development in the canyons and foothills toward areas
meeting suitability criteria as outlined in the general plan, and other
applicable general or community plans. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.020: USING THIS CHAPTER:
The development and design standards set forth in this chapter fall into two
(2) categories:
   A.   Mandatory standards, which are identified by a "+" notation in the left
hand margin; and
   B.   Advisory standards that are strongly encouraged, but not mandatory,
which are identified by a "o" in the left hand margin.
Subdivisions and development subject to this chapter shall comply with all of
the "+" standards and shall attempt to incorporate, to the extent feasible or
practical, all of the "o" standards. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.030: SITE SELECTION AND PLANNING STANDARDS:
   A.   To the maximum extent feasible, match the development program to the
available land on the site:
      + 1. A site shall be selected that is suitable for the type of building
or use being planned without major alternations to the site.
      o 2. The minimum and maximum slopes gradients that can work with each
type of land use in the development program shall be considered. Compare the
amount of land needed for the program with the amount of buildable land on the
site. Select a site that best suits the type of building or use recognizing the
particular opportunities and disadvantages of the site.
      + 3. Avoid sites that show evidence of slope instability, landslides,
avalanche, flooding, or other natural or manmade hazards. (See
chapters 13.75, "Natural Hazard Areas", and 13.74, "Flood Damage Prevention
Regulations", of this title.)
   B.   Site buildings in a manner that preserves existing landforms. (See
figure.)
      o 1. Each building shall be located so that it does not dominate the
site.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, the most prominent areas of the site
shall be left in their natural condition. Structures shall be screened using
existing land forms and vegetation. (See subsection
13.72.030H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this title.)
      + 3. To the maximum extent feasible, buildings should be placed in the
following locations on a site:
         a.   Within tree masses to screen buildings;
         b.   At the edge of trees or land masses overlooking open space; or
         c.   In open areas where they are not visible from roads, trails, or
other public lands.
   C.   Site buildings in a manner that preserves significant view. (See
figure.)
      o 1. Buildings should be designed to fit their sites and to leave natural
massing and features of the landscape intact. Treat each building as an
integral part of the site rather than an isolated object at odds with its
surroundings.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, views both to the site and to
features beyond, as seen from public rights of way, trails, and other public
lands, shall be maintained. To the maximum extent feasible, new construction
shall not dominate views or obscure the views of others.
   D.   Site buildings so their form does not break prominent skylines. (See
figure.)
      + 1. Buildings shall be sited off of highly visible places and designed
so they are not obtrusive, do not loom out over the hillside, and do not break
prominent skylines. Skylines are ridges or hilltops that do not have backdrops
behind them. Heavily traveled roads or public areas are key vantage points.
   E.   Site buildings in a manner that preserves significant trees and
vegetation. (See figure.)
      + 1. The building shall be sited in a place where a minimum amount of
trees and vegetation will need to be removed. (See section
13.72.040, "Establishment Of Limits Of Disturbance", of this title.)
      + 2. New construction shall comply with subsection
13.72.030H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this title, and section
13.73.060, "Landscaping And Vegetation", of this chapter.
   F.   Cluster buildings and parking, and coordinate neighboring developments.
(See figures.)
      o 1. Clustering is encouraged to reduce the amount of land being
disturbed and to share the cost of providing services, road and parking area
maintenance, snow removal, etc. (See section
13.73.090, "Access, Circulation And Off Street Parking", of this chapter.)
      o 2. Cooperation among adjoining landowners to achieve coordinated
development is strongly encouraged. For example, clustering buildings and
combining or sharing services into a central location reduces the number of
access roads and parking areas within a site.
   G.   Locate parking facilities to minimize their visual impact. (See
figure.)
      + 1. Parking facilities shall be located so that they can be screened to
blend into the natural environment and will not require backing onto a public
street. (See section
13.73.090, "Access, Circulation And Off Street Parking", of this chapter.)
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, parking facilities shall be located
to the rear or side of main buildings facing away from a public street or where
they can be screened so they do not dominate the streetscape. Parking
facilities shall be designed to follow the existing topography and to provide
adequate snow storage area.
   H.   Place utility lines underground.
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, utilities shall be placed
underground and within existing roadways or in established shoulders in order
to minimize the impact to existing natural features such as natural vegetative
patterns and land forms. (See figure.)
      + 2. Tree cutting for utility corridors shall be feathered to reduce
visual impacts. All disturbed areas shall be revegetated. (See section
13.73.060, "Landscaping And Revegetation", of this chapter, and subsection
13.72.030H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this title.) (Ord. 2012-15, 9-
20-2012)

   A.   Design buildings so they solidly meet the ground plane. (See figures.)
      + 1. Building designs requiring a strong structural statement such as
extensive cantilevers or cuts and fills on sensitive hillsides shall be
prohibited.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, placing buildings on piers such that
exterior walls do not continue down to the ground shall be prohibited because
of aesthetic and energy efficiency concerns.
      o 3. Buildings that firmly meet the ground convey an appearance of
greater permanence, and shall be strongly encouraged.
   B.   Design buildings on hillsides to follow the natural terrain. (See
figure.)
      + 1. Buildings shall be located to minimize earthwork and land
disturbance.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, buildings shall be sited in
locations that are sympathetic to existing contours rather than those that
require a building solution that would dominate the site. Buildings shall be
designed to follow natural contours rather than modifying the land to accept a
building design not tailored to the site. (See section
13.73.070, "Grading", of this chapter and subsection
13.72.030C, "Grading Standards", of this title.)
   C.   Design buildings to minimize mass and scale. (See figures.)
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, building design shall incorporate
changes in the planes of walls and changes in the slope and height of rooflines
to add variety, create visual interest, and minimize scale.
      o 2. Buildings can be made to seem larger or smaller depending on the
proportional relationship of separate building elements. Human scale buildings
create a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. Building scale should complement
rather than dominate the landscape.
      + 3. To the maximum extent feasible, the massing of buildings shall be
scaled to harmonize and balance with the specific site and its natural
features, especially when buildings are located at tree or landmass edges or in
the open, by incorporating the following design principles:
         o a. Rooflines and building mass should echo the angles and shapes
repeated in the natural landscape, and shift or bend to change directions; and
         + b. Building mass and wall lines shall be broken up to conform to
existing slope and avoid unbroken expanses of building mass and walls that can
intrude into the natural canyon setting and dominate a site. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-
20-2012)
13.73.050: BUILDING MATERIALS AND COLORS:
   A.   Use exterior wall colors that harmonize with the landscape and
surrounding buildings;
      + 1. Indigenous materials and colors shall be used in order to mimic
natural textures.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, predominant tones on exterior walls
shall tend toward neutral colors such as warm earthy hues, dark green of
forests, whites, grays and gray brown of the mountains, the tan of grasses, and
similar colors. Bright, harshly contrasting color combinations shall be
avoided.
   B.   Use roof surfacing materials that blend with the colors of the adjacent
landscape and that are composed of materials which reduce the risk of fire.
      + 1. The color of roof surfacing materials shall be either brown, dark
green, gray, or other color that blends in with the surrounding landscape.
      + 2. Wood roofing shingles shall not be allowed in the canyons or
foothills because of their potential to ignite during wildfires and increase
structural damage. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.060: LANDSCAPING AND VEGETATION:
See also subsection
13.72.030H, "Tree And Vegetation Protection", of this title for those
properties located in the Foothills and Canyons Overlay Zone.
   A.   Preserve existing trees and vegetation:
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, existing concentrations of protected
trees and vegetation shall be preserved and remain undisturbed as an important
site amenity. For the purposes of this chapter, "protected trees and
vegetation" shall be defined as set forth in section
13.04.040 of this title. (See also subsection
13.73.030E of this chapter.)
         + a. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in this section,
existing vegetation located within thirty feet (30') of the primary structure
on a site shall be thinned and regularly maintained to help minimize the risk
of property damage from wildfire, and to provide space for firefighting
equipment and personnel.
         o b. When landscaping within this thirty foot (30') firebreak area,
use of fire resistant plants is strongly encouraged. (For a list of fire
resistant plants, contact the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Salt Lake Ranger
District, or the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands.) See also
subsection
13.72.030H3c, "Wildfire Hazards And Tree/Vegetation Removal", of this title.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, dryland species shall be selected
for slope revegetation, and irrigation will be minimized to reduce potential
problems. (Ord. 2019-04, 2-28-2019)
   B.   Landscape to retain harmony between the various elements of a landscape
and to preserve its original character:
      + 1. Landscaping for new development shall incorporate natural features
in the landscape such as trees, significant vegetative patterns, interesting
landforms, rocks, water, views and orientation.
      + 2. Landscaped areas shall be an integral part of the development
project, and not simply located in leftover space on the site. New planting
shall blend in with the existing landscape.
      + 3. All disturbed areas shall be revegetated using native or adapted
plant species and materials characteristic of the area.
      o 4. Use of fire resistant plants is also strongly encouraged. (For a
list of fire resistant plants, contact the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Salt
Lake Ranger District, or the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.)
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.070: GRADING:
   A.   Limit site grading for buildings to preserve existing landforms. See
subsection
13.72.030C, "Grading Standards", of this title. (See section
13.72.080, "Figures", of this title.)
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, building designs that require
extensive cut and fills shall not be allowed.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, modification of the natural terrain
shall be minimized by retaining the natural landscape, including existing trees
and vegetation.
      + 3. To the maximum extent feasible, slopes steeper than thirty percent
(30%) shall not be disturbed.
      + 4. To the maximum extent feasible, buildings, driveways, and roads
shall follow the natural contours of the site. Site grading shall follow
appendix chapter 33, excavation and grading, of the Uniform Building Code (1997
edition, as amended from time to time) and Best Management Practices (1977) as
set forth in the Salt Lake County Erosion-Sediment Control Handbook (1981
edition and as amended from time to time). (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.080: DRAINAGE:
   A.   Site design shall not change natural drainage patterns. (See section
13.72.080, figure 18 of this title.)
      + 1. All final grading and drainage shall comply with appendix chapter
33, excavation and grading of the Uniform Building Code (1994 edition and as
amended from time to time) and best management practices (1977) as set forth in
the Salt Lake County erosion-sediment control handbook (1981 and as amended
from time to time).
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, development shall preserve the
natural surface drainage pattern unique to each site as a result of topography
and vegetation. Grading shall ensure that drainage flows away from all
structures, especially structures that are cut into hillsides. Natural drainage
patterns may be modified on site only if the applicant shows that there will be
no significant adverse environmental impacts on site or on adjacent properties.
If natural drainage patterns are modified, appropriate stabilization techniques
shall be employed.
      + 3. Development shall mitigate all negative or adverse drainage impacts
on adjacent and surrounding sites.
      + 4. Standard erosion control methods shall be used during construction
to protect water quality, control drainage, and reduce soil erosion. Sediment
traps, small dams, or barriers of straw bales shall be located wherever there
are grade changes to slow the velocity of runoff.
   B.   Locate buildings outside stream corridor buffer zones:
      + 1. Permanent structures shall be located a minimum of one hundred feet
(100') horizontally (plan view) from the ordinary high water mark of stream
corridors or other bodies of water. (See figure.) At the discretion of the
community development director, and based on site specific studies such as
soils or vegetation, setback distances may be reduced according to the
modification provisions and criteria set forth in subsection
13.72.060B of this title, or greater setback distances may be required. The
community development department, and the health department should be consulted
in determining appropriate site specific setback requirements. See also
subsection
13.72.030J, "Stream Corridor And Wetlands Protection", of this title.
      + 2. To the maximum extent feasible, developments shall not alter natural
waterways.
   C.   Bridges for stream crossings are recommended. (See figures.)
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, the use of culverts to cross
perennial streams shall not be allowed. Culverts may be used on small side
drainages, across swales, and on ephemeral or intermittent streams. See
subsection
13.72.030J, "Stream Corridor And Wetlands Protection", of this title.
      + 2. Bridges and culverts shall be sized to pass 100-year storm events.
Concrete or stone head walls and side walls shall be required to maintain the
integrity of the bridge structure. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.090: ACCESS, CIRCULATION AND OFF STREET PARKING:
   A.   Design traffic circulation to respect existing topography, achieve
acceptable slopes, and adhere to minimum width and turning standards:
      + 1. Safe and adequate access shall be provided in all new development.
Access shall be of adequate width to allow for snowplowing and snow storage;
      + 2. Access roads shall avoid steep grades and sharp turning radii that
can make access, especially in the winter, difficult;
      + 3. Roads and driveways which run perpendicular to the contours of a
site shall be prohibited. (See figures.)
   B.   Provide safe, adequate off street parking with year round access (See
figures.)
      + 1. New development shall provide off street parking as required by this
land use ordinance.
      o 2. Shared driveways and shared parking areas with adjoining owners are
strongly encouraged in order to reduce maintenance costs and overall impacts on
the environment.
      + 3. Access to off street parking areas shall be from a private driveway
or roadway and not directly from a public street or road. Off street parking
areas shall be large enough that persons accessing or leaving the site are not
required to back out onto a public street unless the community development
director or the planning commission determines that the street is not a major
thoroughfare and that no safety or traffic flow problems will result.
      + 4. The location of off street parking facilities shall comply with this
chapter. Such areas shall be properly screened and be located on land proven to
be suitable for development.
   C.   Design new roads and driveways to reduce their visual impact:
      + 1. To the maximum extent feasible, roads and driveways shall be
screened using existing land forms and vegetation and any cuts and fills shall
be regraded to repeat adjacent land forms. To the maximum extent feasible, long
tangents shall be avoided in favor of curvilinear alignments reflecting
topography, and curve side roads as soon as possible after intersection with
arterial roads or highways.
      + 2. Cuts and fills for new roads and driveways shall be revegetated with
native plant materials. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.100: FENCES:
   A.   Place fences to respect existing landforms, follow existing contours,
and blend into the natural setting of the site. (See figures.)
      + 1. Fences as part of development on sensitive lands shall be limited to
fences necessary to screen service and outdoor areas. (See also subsection
13.72.030C8, "Retaining Walls", of this title.)
      + 2. Fencing used to screen patios, other outdoor areas, and service
areas that are adjacent to buildings may be opaque. The use of natural or
stained wood for such fencing is strongly encouraged. Other appropriate fencing
materials include brick, rock, stone and wrought iron.
      + 3. The following fencing materials shall not be allowed:
         a.   Solid board;
         b.   Concrete or concrete block;
         c.   Chainlink, except around telecommunications facilities and public
utility compounds;

arterial roads and highways, and to delineate property lines.
      + 5. Fences located along property lines and arterial roads or highways
are limited to a maximum of forty two inches (42") in height.
      + 6. Solid barrier fences located along arterial roads or highways, or
placed directly on a site's front property line, are out of character with the
natural setting, block views, and shall be prohibited.
      + 7. Walls and fences shall be reviewed on a site by site basis (during
site plan review if applicable) and shall require a building permit. (Ord.
2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.73.110: NIGHT LIGHTING:
Locate lighting fixtures only where needed to provide for the safe movement of
people on the site. (See figures.)
   o A. Bright lighting of large areas should only occur where absolutely
required by safety considerations, except that lighting for outdoor recreation
areas shall be permitted. However, recreation areas must be sensitive to
potential impacts its outdoor lighting may have on adjoining properties.
   + B. Outdoor lighting sources shall be shielded and directional. (Ord. 2012-

ARTICLE I. OVERVIEW
13.74.005: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Utah has delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.010: FINDINGS:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Holladay are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   The city of Holladay hereby adopts the FEMA flood insurance rate maps
(FIRM) and effective FEMA flood insurance studies (FIS) and all subsequent maps
and studies of FEMA. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.74.020: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.030: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
   A.   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
13.74.040: DEFINITIONS OF WORDS AND PHRASES:
See section
13.04.040 of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
ARTICLE III. GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.74.051: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the city of Holladay. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.052: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency
management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood
Insurance Study For City Of Holladay", dated November 19, 2021, with
accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRMs
and FBFMs) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord.
2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.74.053: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.054: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.055: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2012-15,
9-20-2012)
13.74.056: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.057: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2012-15,
9-20-2012)
ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION

permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   E.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
   F.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management
agency.
   G.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   H.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
section
13.74.052 of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of article V of this chapter.
   I.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
   J.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the

will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
   E.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with subsection
13.74.061A of this article;
Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator
shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following
relevant factors:
   A.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   B.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
   C.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
   D.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   E.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   F.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
   G.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
   H.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
   I.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
   J.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that
area. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)

restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section
13.74.062 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (section
13.74.020 of this chapter).
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      1.   The criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are
met, and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)

from the systems into floodwaters; and
   G.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.071: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in: a) section
13.74.052 of this chapter, b) subsection
13.74.061H of this chapter, or c) subsection
13.74.072C of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   A.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the

this chapter, is satisfied.
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   C.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other

floodwaters.
   D.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: a)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, b) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      3.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-
30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this section be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation, or
         b.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and

      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days,
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      3.   Meet the permit requirements of section
13.74.062 of this chapter, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.072: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
   A.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections
13.74.010,
13.74.020 and 13.74.030 of this chapter.
   B.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
13.74.053 and
13.74.062 of this chapter, and the provisions of this article.
   C.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home

13.74.073: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING:
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
13.74.052 of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These
areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply: (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest abutting grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
(Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   C.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in section
13.74.062 of this chapter, are satisfied.
   D.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.074: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
13.74.052 of this chapter, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   A.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this article.
   C.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.080: ADOPTION OF FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS REQUIRED:
In accordance with section 59.2(b) of CFR 44, chapter 1, of the national flood
insurance program (NFIP) regulation, to qualify for the sale of federally
subsidized flood insurance, a community must adopt floodplain management
regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards of section 60. "These
regulations must include effective enforcement provisions". In accordance with
section 60.1(b) of CFR 44, chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations, "These
regulations must be legally enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the
community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood prone (i.e.,
mudflow) or flood related erosion areas, and the community must provide that
the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting local laws,
ordinances or codes". (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.74.081: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than
thirty (30) days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the city of Holladay from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)

13.75.030: APPLICABILITY:
These regulations are applicable to all lands within the geologic hazard
special study areas in the city, as shown on the geologic hazards maps in this
Appendix A. Such maps and all amendments thereto are made a part of this
chapter as if fully described and detailed herein. Each change in the geologic
hazards maps shall be subject to the amendment procedures set forth in
Chapter 13.07 of this title. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-
14-2021)
13.75.040: GEOLOGIC HAZARDS STUDY AREA MAPS:
   A.   The boundary lines of the special study areas shown on the geologic
hazards' maps shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.
Maps intend to represent generalized scientific information designed to
indicate areas where hazards may exist and where geologic hazards studies are
required. Because the geologic hazards study area maps are prepared at a non-
site specific scale, hazards may exist that are not shown on the geologic
hazards study area maps. A site that is not shown in a geologic hazards study
area for a particular hazard does not exempt the applicant from considering the
hazard if evidence is found that it may exist. If it is subsequently determined
that the site features a geologic hazard not represented on the geologic
hazards study area maps, the review process will be pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   Geologic hazards study area maps may be updated and amended by the city
as per
Chapter 13.07 if found to be inaccurate or in error, or as new methods or data
are developed to better define areas of potential hazards.
   C.   Where geologic hazards study area maps are thought by an applicant to
be inaccurate or in error and require revision, the applicant shall submit to
the city technical evidence by a qualified professional supporting the claim
and showing the proposed revision. The city will review the information and
render a decision. The applicant may appeal that decision to the city council.
(Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.050: RESPONSIBILITY FOR GEOLOGIC HAZARD STUDIES:
Geologic hazard studies often involve both engineering geology and geotechnical
engineering. Engineering geologic studies shall be performed under the direct
supervision of a qualified professional engineering geologist. Geotechnical
engineering studies shall be performed under the direct supervision of a
qualified professional geotechnical engineer. (Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.060: PRELIMINARY SITE WORK/ACTIVITIES:
This section shall apply to any geologic hazard investigation for the purpose
of determining the feasibility of development or for the purpose of exploring,
evaluating or establishing locations for permanent improvements.
   A.   Scoping Meeting: The developer or consultant shall schedule a scoping
meeting with the city's technical review committee (TRC) to evaluate the
engineering geologist/geotechnical engineer's investigative approach. At this
meeting, the consultant shall present a work plan that includes locations of
anticipated geologic hazards and locations of proposed exploratory activities
necessary to minimum standard of practice. The investigation approach should
allow for flexibility due to unexpected site conditions. Field findings may
require modifications to the work plan. Upon completion of a successful scoping
meeting, a grading permit application may be submitted to the City.
   B.   Grading Permit: As required by title 13 of this code and except as
otherwise noted therein, no person shall commence or perform any grubbing,
grading, earthwork, or any other land disturbance activity, without first
obtaining a permit. Application shall be filed with the community and economic
development department on forms provided and maintained by the city for such
purpose. (Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.070: GEOLOGIC HAZARD STUDIES AND REPORTS REQUIRED:

13.75.080: GEOLOGIC HAZARDS REPORT:
   A.   Preparation: The geologic hazards report shall be prepared by an
engineering geologist. In the case of a snow avalanche hazard, the report shall
be prepared by an experienced avalanche expert. The report shall be signed by
the preparer and shall also include the qualifications of the preparer.
   B.   Content: The report shall be site specific and identify all known or
suspected potential geologic hazards, originating on site or off site,
affecting the particular property. The report shall reflect current
professional practice similar or to exceed the guidelines suggested in Utah
Geologic Survey Circular 122 (2016) or it beyond the minimum reporting
standards may be required to adequately address the fault hazard. Minimum
replacement document. Considering the complexity of evaluating surface and
near-surface faults, additional effort reporting standards required or
inferred, does not relieve the engineering geologist from his/her duty to
perform additional geologic or engineering services he/she believes are
necessary to assess the fault rupture potential at a site.
   C.   Site Map: The report shall include a detailed site map (scale: 1-inch
equals 200 feet or larger), showing the location of the hazards with
delineation of the recommended setback distances from hazards and the
recommended location for structures.
   D.   Effects Addressed: The report shall address the potential effects of
the hazards on the proposed development and occupants thereof in terms of risk
and potential damage.
   E.   Recommendations: The report shall contain recommendations for avoidance
or mitigation of the effects ofthe hazards, consistent with the purposes set
forth in section
13.75.010 of this chapter. The evidence on which recommendations and
conclusions are based shall be clearly stated in the report. Trench logs
(scale: 1-inch equals 5 feet, or larger), aerial photographs, references with
citations, and other supporting information as applicable, shall also, be
included in the report. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-
2021)
13.75.090: REVIEW OF REPORTS; APPROVAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Review: In order to fulfill the purposes of this chapter, the planning
commission (for conditional uses and subdivisions), and the community
development department (for permitted uses) shall review any proposed
development which requires preparation of a geologic hazards report under this
chapter to determine the possible risks to the safety of persons or property
from geologic hazards.
   B.   Expert Review; Costs: Prior to consideration by the planning commission
or the community development department of any such development, the community
development department shall submit the report to the city engineer, the Utah
geological and mineral survey, the U.S. forest service, and/or other experts
for reviewand recommendation. Any cost the city must pay for the review shall
be paid by the applicant prior to planning commission or community development
department action. The community development department shall file a copy of
the geologic hazards report in the city geologic hazards library and another
copy with the Utah geological and mineral survey.
   C.   Standards: The city geologist and other retained experts in their
review of the report, and the planning commission or community development
director in their consideration of the development, shall determine whether the
development complies with the following standards:
      1.   The development does not present an unreasonable risk to the safety
of persons or property (including public streets), or to the aesthetics and
geologic functions of the landscape (e.g., drainage, wildlife habitat, etc.)
because of the presences of geologic hazards.
      2.   At the planning commission's discretion, with advice from the city's
consulting geologist, such area may be approved for development if the
applicant submits substantial evidence that, using best available practices,
the identified hazards can be mitigated to a level where the risk to human life
and damage to property, as well as the risk to the aesthetics and geologic
functions of the site, are reduced to a reasonable and acceptable level in a
manner which has a minimum effect on the geologic environment.
   D.   Necessary Requirements May Be Set: The planning commission or community
development director may set requirements necessary to reduce the risks from
geologic hazards as a condition to the approval of any development which
requires preparation of a geologic hazards report. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012;
amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.100: DISPUTES, APPEAL PROCEDURE:
An applicant may appeal any decision made under the provisions of this chapter
only after the city has issued a written review of a report, and shall set
forth the specific grounds or issues upon which the appeal is based. The appeal
shall be submitted in writing to the director of community development within
thirty (30) days ofthe issuance of the written review or other decision. The
city shall assemble a professional panel of three (3) qualified experts to
serve as the appeal authority for any technical dispute. The panel shall
consist of an expert designated by the city, an expert designated by the
applicant, and an expert chosen by the city's and the applicant's designated
experts. If the city's and the applicant's designated experts cannot reach a
consensus of the third expert within thirty (30) days, the city shall select
the third expert. Decisions of the panel will be binding and will be based on
the majority decision of the panel. The costs of the appeal process shall be
paid by the applicant. (Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.110: ACTIVE FAULT CONSIDERATIONS:
No critical facility (excluding transportation lines or utilities which by
their nature may cross active faults) or structures designed for human
occupancy shall be built astride an active fault. If a fault is discovered in
the excavation for such a structure, a special study, as described in section
13.75.080 of this chapter, shall be performed to determine if the fault is
active, and if the fault is determined to be active, the procedures set forth
in section
13.75.090 of this chapter shall be followed. No structure designed for human
occupancy shall be built on a fault scarp. Footing setbacks from a fault scarp
shall meet the requirements of chapter 29 of the uniform building code. The
community development director may increase footing setback requirements where
information from a geotechnical report indicates slope conditions warrant a
greater setback distance. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-
2021)
13.75.120: DISCLOSURE WHEN A GEOLOGIC HAZARDS REPORT IS REQUIRED:
Whenever a geologic hazards report is required under this chapter the owner of
such parcel shall record a restrictive covenant running with the land in a form
satisfactory to the city prior to the approval of any development or
subdivision of such parcel, which includes the following:
   A.   Notice that the parcel is located within a geologic hazards special
study area as shown on the geologic hazards map;
   B.   Notice of the existence and availability of the geologic hazards report
for public inspection in the city geologic hazards library; and
   C.   An agreement by the owner of the parcel and any successor in interest
to comply with any conditions set by the planning commission or community
development director to minimize potential adverse effects of the geologic
hazards. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.130: DISCLOSURE WHEN NO GEOLOGIC HAZARDS REPORT IS REQUIRED:
Whenever the applicant for any new development for human occupancy is not
required under this chapter to prepare a geologic hazards report, although the
parcel to be developed is located within a high or moderate liquefaction
potential special study area, or surface fault rupture special study area, as
shown on thegeologic hazards maps, notice that the parcel is located within
such areas shall be recorded by the landowner in a form satisfactory to the
city prior to the approval of any such development. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012;
Ord. 2021-26, 10- 14-2021)
13.75.140: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER:
The geologic hazards ordinance codified in this chapter and geologic hazards
maps represent only those hazardous areas known to the city, and should not be
construed to include all possible potential hazard areas. The geologic hazards
ordinance and the geologic hazards maps may be amended as new information
becomes available pursuant to procedures set forth in
chapter 13.07 of this title. The provisions of this chapter do not in any way
assure or imply that areas outside its boundaries will be free from the
possible adverse effects of geologic hazards. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof for any
damages from geologic hazards that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative requirement or decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2012-15,
9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.150: CHANGE OF USE:
No change in use which results in the conversion of a building or structure
from one not used for human occupancy to one that is so used shall be permitted
unless the building or structure complies with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)
13.75.160: CONFLICTING REGULATIONS:
In cases of conflict between the provisions of existing zoning classifications,
building code, subdivision regulations, or any other ordinance of the city and
the geologic hazards ordinance codified in this chapter, the most restrictive
provision shall apply. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2021-26, 10-14-2021)

13.76.400: WATERWAYS PROTECTION:
   A.   Purpose Statement: This section consists of supplemental regulations
pertaining to the development or redevelopment of land uses, near waterways.
Protection areas are therefore established within one hundred feet (100') of a
natural waterway and twenty feet (20') from a canal system. Development
standards within these areas are established to minimize erosion and stabilize
stream banks, improve water quality, reduce potential for flood damage,
preserve tree canopy, as well as to preserve in function and capacity all man-
made canals, ditches and other irrigation facilities. Whenever there is a
conflict between the regulations of a base zoning district and those described
within this section, the regulations of this section shall prevail.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   Applicability: The regulations set forth in this section supplement
those regulations in the underlying base zoning district. In General, no person
shall engage in any ground disturbing activity, development or demolition
within 100 feet of a natural waterway and or 20 feet from a canal on a lot or
parcel that will remove, fill, dredge, clear, grub, destroy, armor, terrace, or
otherwise impact a waterway protection area through manipulation of soil or
other material except as allowed by:
         a.   Provision defined within this section.
         b.   Site plan approval by Planning Commission in conjunction with the
site plan approval processes set forth in
chapter 13.08 of this title.
         c.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Salt Lake County Flood Control,
the Utah State Engineer, or any other government agency with jurisdiction over
land within waterway protection buffer, and
      2.   Relationship to Other Laws: The requirements of this section shall
apply to other applicable federal, state, county, or city law or regulation.
         a.   Compliance with the requirements of this section shall not
relieve a landowner from compliance with other applicable provisions of Title
13 and Title 17 of this code except as expressly otherwise set forth in this
section.
         b.   If a landowner proposes a use or development which is dually
located within the areas described in this section and those areas located
within the jurisdiction of a federal or state government agency or Salt Lake
County, the landowner shall apply for approvals from both applicable
jurisdictions. If the relevant federal, state, or county agency approves the
use or development as in compliance with the agency’s requirements, then the
City shall issue a Waterway Protection Permit, subject to compliance with the
federal, state, or county approval and shall not independently review the use
or development for compliance with this section.
         c.   Salt Lake County utility services shall not be required to obtain
a Waterway Protection Permit for any county flood control activity authorized
by the Utah code within or along a natural waterway. However, Salt Lake County
shall obtain a Waterway Protection Permit for any stream restoration and non-
flood control development or other use located within the areas as described in
section
13.76.400E(2).
         d.   A city department or other canal company, irrigation water
provider or agency that conducts a use or development within a protection area
shall follow the requirements of this section and obtain a Waterway Protection
Permit if required.

reasonably demonstrates imminent danger to individuals or property is
associated with the subject land;
         c.   May adopt reasonable procedures, including approval of general
permits, to implement the provisions of this section; and
         d.   May designate one or more staff persons within the department to
carry out these responsibilities. Wherever this section refers to the CED
Director, such reference shall also include the Director’s designee.
      2.   Technical Review Committee (TRC): The TRC shall review the
application for completeness and make recommendation as per the process and
procedure set forth in subsection D.
      3.   Appeal Of Decision: Any person adversely affected by any decision
made may, within thirty (30) days, apply for an appeal as per 13.101 Appendix

13.76.700: FILL WORK AND LAND EXCAVATIONS; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: This section is adopted to promote public safety
and the general public welfare; to protect property against loss from erosion,
earth movement and flooding; to maintain a superior community environment; to
provide for the continued orderly growth of the City; and to ensure the maximum
preservation of the natural scenic character of major portions of the City by
protecting against detrimental impacts to neighboring properties due to large
changes in the natural grade and topography; to prevent large unsightly exposed
surfaces of retaining walls that attract graffiti, generate large amounts of
heat and runoff, and create significant incompatibility between the grades of
neighboring properties; and to encourage preservation of the natural grade and
topography, and to encourage adaptation of new development to existing grades;
to establish minimum standards and requirements relating to land grading,
excavations, and fills, and procedures by which these standards and
requirements may be enforced. It is intended that this section be administered
with the foregoing purposes in mind and specifically in an attempt to:
      1.   Ensure that the development of each site occurs in a manner
harmonious with adjacent lands so as to minimize problems of drainage, erosion,
earth movement and similar hazards.
      2.   Ensure the public lands and places, watercourses, streets, and all
other lands in the City are protected from erosion, earth movement or drainage
hazards.
      3.   Ensure that the planning, design and construction of all development
will be done in a manner which provides maximum safety and human enjoyment and
except where specifically intended otherwise, makes such construction as
unobtrusive in the natural terrain as possible.
      4.   Ensure the maximum retention of natural vegetation to aid in
protection against erosion, earth movement and other hazards and to aid in
preservation of the natural scenic qualities of the community.
      5.   Provide for a recordable instrument of acknowledgement executable by
the property owner accepting maintenance of grading and/or surface water
retention improvements. (Ord. 2018-16, 10-11-2018)

      2.   For work requiring a permit, plans and specifications shall be
completed by a registered professional engineer and/or a registered
professional landscape architect or registered professional arborist.
      3.   Retaining walls in excess of four feet (4') require a permit. Plans
shall be submitted in accordance with subsection F of this section. (Ord. 2019-
04, 2-28-2019)
      4.   Approved permits shall be issued upon execution of an
acknowledgement of "Site Grading Management Agreement" kept on file with the
City, which shall be recorded against the property.
   C.   Responsibility: Failure of the City officials to observe or recognize
hazardous or unsightly conditions, or to recommend denial of the conditional
use permit, or of the Planning Commission to deny said permit shall not relieve
the permittee from responsibility for the condition or damages resulting
therefrom.
   D.   Retention Of Plans: Plans, specifications and reports for all
conditional use permit applications submitted to the City for approval shall be
retained by the City for a minimum period of two (2) years.
   E.   Inspections:
      1.   The Community Development Director and building official, with
assistance from the City Engineer, shall make the inspections of all projects
under "permit". Where it is found that conditions substantially differ from
those stated or shown in the conditional use permit application, the City may
stop further work until and unless approval is obtained for a revised grading
plan conforming to the existing conditions.
      2.   Plans for grading work shall be maintained at the site during the
progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, the building
permit shall be prominently displayed near the front property line of the
property involved so as to be visible from the street on which the property
fronts.
      3.   In order to obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the City
twenty four (24) hours before said inspection is to be made.
      4.   Inspections shall be made:
         a.   Before commencement of grading operations and after required
construction stakes have been set; and

neighborhoods shall comply with the City's noise ordinance.
      3.   All graded or disturbed surfaces of excavations, and all equipment
materials and roadways on the site shall be dampened or suitably treated,
managed, or contained to prevent the deposit of dust on neighboring properties;
all materials transported to or from the site shall be so contained during
transportation as to prevent spillage on streets or other property outside of
the site.
      4.   Maximum unretained or exposed slope of a permanent cut and fill area
shall be thirty percent (30%). The City Engineer may require the percent of
slope of a cut or fill to be reduced if it is found that the cut or fill is
subject to unusual or excessive erosion, or if other conditions make such
requirements necessary for stability.
      5.   All fill, except in publicly approved refuse disposal or other
landfill operations, shall be earth, rock, or other inert materials free from
organic material and free of metal, and except that topsoil spread on cut and
fill surfaces may incorporate humus for desirable moisture retention and plant
growth properties.
      6.   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface waters from
damaging the cut face of an excavation or any portion of a fill. All drainage
ways and structures shall carry surface waters without producing erosion to the
nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse acceptable to the

Engineer may require such drainage structures to be constructed or installed as
necessary to prevent erosion damage or to prevent saturation of the fill or
material behind cut slopes.
      7.   Exposed or finished cuts or slopes of any fill or excavation shall
be smoothly graded to a maximum slope of thirty percent (30%). All exposed
slopes of any cut or fill shall be protected from erosion or sloughing by

forth in section
13.78 of this title.
      11.   Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in any slope
of any excavation or filled site shall be backfilled and compacted to the level
of the surrounding grades.
      12.   Unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer, all fills governed
by this Code intended to support buildings, structures, or where otherwise
required to be compacted for stability, shall be compacted, inspected and
tested in accordance with the following provisions:
         a.   The natural ground surface shall be prepared by removal of
topsoil and vegetation and, if necessary, shall be graded to a series of
terraces;
         b.   The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not
exceeding six inches (6") in thickness, and shall be compacted by "sheepsfoot"

grading and used on cut and fill slopes. When slopes too steep to support
continuous ground cover have been permitted and in lieu thereof niches and
ledges provided for planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous
ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and
fills along public roads may be required to be landscaped so as to blend into
the natural surroundings. All plant materials must be approved by the Community
Development Director prior to issuance of a conditional use permit.
      14.   Filling of the ground for agricultural or fire protection purposes
shall be accomplished with such practices as will prevent erosion and damage to
natural drainage channels. (Ord. 2018-16, 10-11-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-12, 7-16-
2020))
   G.   Final Inspection:
      1.   If upon final inspection of any grading it is found that the work
authorized by the conditional use permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this Code and any other requirements
imposed, the Community Development Director shall issue a certificate of
compliance.
      2.   The Planning Commission shall have the power to revoke any
conditional use permit whenever it is found that the work covered by the
certificate has been materially extended or altered without prior approval, or
that any planting, retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, or other
protective devices as shown on the approved plans and specifications submitted
with the application for a permit have not been maintained in good order and
repair.
      3.   Before such revocation, the Community Development Director shall
first give fifteen (15) calendar days' written notice to the owner of the
property involved, specifying the defective condition and stating that unless
such defective condition is remedied satisfactorily, the conditional use permit
may be revoked. If the defective condition is remedied to the satisfaction of
the community development director, the certificate shall not be revoked.
   H.   Special Precautions:
      1.   Special precautions shall be taken to preserve life, property
values, stable soils conditions and aesthetics, including, but not limited to,
the following:
         a.   Requiring a level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered soils engineer
and/or engineering geologist whose recommendation may be made a requirement for
further mitigation of unstable conditions. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
         b.   Where it appears that storm runoff damage may result from work
performed hereunder, such work may be stopped and the permittee required to
take such measures as may be necessary to protect adjacent property or the
public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail,
the community development director may specify the time at which grading may
proceed and the time of completion or may require that the operation be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
   I.   Excavations:
      1.   All excavations shall be limited as follows:
         a.   No cut slope shall exceed a vertical height of fifty feet (50')
unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of twenty feet (20') are
installed at each fifty feet (50') of vertical height.
         b.   No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than
two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) unless otherwise approved by the community
development director based on the recommendation of a professionally prepared
soils report and/or after supporting data supplied by the applicant. In no case
shall slopes be cut steeper than the bedding planes, fault or joint in any
formation where the cut slope will lie on the dip side of the strike line of
the fracture, bedding plane, fault or joint. No slopes shall be cut in an
existing landslide, mudflow, or other form of naturally unstable slope except
as recommended by a qualified geological engineer. Where the excavation is
exposed straight above the top of the cut that will permit the entry of water
along bedding planes, this area shall be sealed with a compacted soil blanket
having a minimum thickness of two feet (2'). The soil for this blanket shall be
relatively impervious and must be approved for such use by the soils
engineering geologist. If the material of the slope is of such composition and
character as to be unstable under the anticipated maximum moisture content, the
slope angle shall be reduced to a stable value.
      2.   No excavation for construction of new utility lines shall be made in
paved public streets within three (3) years after paving. During said three (3)
year period, utility excavations may be authorized by the city for emergency
reasons and when delaying such excavation would cause undue hardship provided
that pavement repair and mitigation measures acceptable to the city engineer
are implemented.
   J.   Fills:
      1.   All fills shall be limited as follows:
         a.   No fill slope shall exceed a vertical height of fifty feet (50')
unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of twenty feet (20') are
installed at each fifty feet (50') of vertical height.
         b.   No fill shall be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in
slope than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) unless otherwise approved by
the community development director based on the recommendations of a
professionally prepared soils report and/or other supporting data provided by
the applicant.
   K.   Prohibited Activities:
      1.   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as permitting
the removal of topsoil solely for resale, or of permitting quarrying of any
site within the limits of the city.
      2.   This chapter shall also not be construed as authorizing any person
to maintain a private or public nuisance upon his or her property, and
compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any
action to abate such nuisance.
   L.   Remediation: In addition to enforcement provisions pursuant to
chapter 13.94 of this title, violations of this section shall be subject to
mandatory remediation of the site as specified by the community development
director with technical assistance from the city engineer. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-

13.77.130: Administrative Relief
13.77.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   The intent of this chapter is to consolidate and clarify the various
sections in this title which previous to adoption of this chapter addressed
landscaping regulations for all zones within the City.
   B.   The regulations of this chapter are intended to set landscaping
standards in the City of Holladay that will improve community livability,
preserve the quality of life, and enhance the aesthetic quality, economic
viability, and environmental sustainability of the City by promoting:
      1.   More efficient use of water resources;
      2.   Preservation and enhancement of the City’s environmental and
aesthetic character;
      3.   Promotion of design continuity between adjacent land uses;
      4.   Preservation, enhancement, and expansion of the city’s tree canopy;
      5.   Improved management of stormwater runoff;
      6.   Reduction in the absorption and re-generation of heat from paved
vehicular parking areas and other impervious surfaces;
      7.   Promotion of screening and buffering between land uses by way of
providing adequate vegetation;
      8.   Reduction of landscape maintenance costs.
   C.   Landscaping can be a significant expense to businesses and residents.
At the same time, landscaping improves the livability of residential
neighborhoods, enhances the appearance and customer attraction of commercial
areas, increases property values, improves the compatibility of adjacent uses,
screens undesirable views, and can reduce heat and air and noise pollution.
   D.   The intent of these regulations is to achieve a balance between the
right of individuals to develop and maintain their property in a manner they
prefer and the rights of City residents to live, work, shop, and recreate in
pleasant, healthy, and attractive surroundings.
   E.   These regulations are intended in part to accommodate Localscapes®,
design aspects encouraging the use of water conserving landscape designs and
low water use plant materials irrigated by drip type water systems and to
discourage landscaping that requires high water use for maintenance while
preserving Holladay’s unique tree canopy, character and inventory.
   F.   The City’s street tree/community tree program and its recognition as a
tree city sets the standard for public and private property management of the
valuable, historic tree coverage that gives Holladay a unique environment not
generally found in other areas of the region. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013; amd.

requirements and recommendations are intended to augment the perimeter
landscaping requirements as required by section
13.77.050 of this chapter:
      1.   A minimum of one tree shall be required for every three hundred
(300) square feet of the required internal landscaping area. Up to five percent
(5%) of the required trees may be substituted by shrubs. Ten (10) shrubs with a
minimum container size of five (5) gallons shall be required for each
substituted tree.
      2.   The location of the internal landscaping area shall abut those
building elevations which form the major public views of the project from
abutting streets and property and to the users of the project, or within a
plaza or courtyard between buildings or portions of buildings, or in a similar
area which substantially conforms to the stated purpose of the required
internal landscaping standards set forth herein and approved by the Planning
Commission.
      3.   Landscaping around the base of a structure is recommended to
visually “soften” the edge between the parking lot and building and to also
discourage graffiti.
      4.   Building entries should be emphasized with special landscaping and/
or paving in combination with lighting.
   C.   Berming: Berming at the edge of the building in conjunction with the
landscaping may be used to soften and screen parking areas, reduce structure
mass and height along street facades, and contain or direct stormwater runoff.
Berms may not encroach into any clear view area of a street or driveway.
   D.   Hardscape Materials: Decorative paving materials such as bricks,
pavers, flagstones, decorative gravels, artificial turf, and textured concrete
may be utilized if they form a useful open space, add color or texture to the
design, and comply with the purpose and intent of this section. Untextured
concrete or lava rocks are not permissible hardscape materials. All impervious
hardscape areas within a landscaped area must be considered as part of the
overall impervious surface coverage allowance as required by other provisions
of this title.
   E.   Landscaping Irrigation: Generally, landscaping emplaced in conjunction
with newly or re-developing construction on site and in parking lot areas shall
be irrigated with an efficiently designed drip sprinkler system which
automatically adjusts to frequency and duration of irrigation events in
response to changing weather conditions, i.e rain delay/shut off capabilities.
Said system will be designed and maintained to limit waste and watershed onto
adjoining public right(s) of way. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013; amd. Ord. 2015-02,

16-2022; Ord. 2023-09, 9-7-2023; Ord. 2023-10, 9-7-2023)
13.77.060: PARKING LOT/PARKING STRUCTURE LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of perimeter and internal parking lot landscaping
is not to restrict the use of locally adapted and sustainable landscaping but
encourage design implementation to soften and mitigate the visual effect of (a)
large expanse(s) of asphalt. Landscaping can also reduce summer heat gain in
parking areas and define pedestrianways.
   B.   Hardscape Parking [Lot] Requirements: Landscaping in hardscape parking
areas, in all non-single and [non] two-family residential zones, shall meet the
following minimum requirements:
      1.   Overall Landscape Coverage Standards:
         a.   In general, any and all parking lots shall be landscaped such
that landscape coverage in an around the periphery of a/the lot complies with
the overall percentage minimums set forth in
Table 13.77.061 below.
TABLE 13.77.061
 
Size Of Parking Area(s)   Percent to be Landscaped
Less than 15,000 sq. ft.  5
15,000 sq. ft. and larger 7.5
 
Furthermore, all open-air parking lots designed for, or containing, six (6) or
more parking spaces shall provide landscaping in accordance with the provisions
of this sub-section. Conversely, parking lots designed for five (5) or fewer
parking spaces shall not be required to provide landscaping other than
providing the percentage of yard area landscaping and landscaped buffering as
specified in
Table 13.77.061 above; however,
         (1)   Only the first ten-feet (10') [width/depth] of landscape(d)
areas located along and around the perimeter of a parking lot (i.e., beyond the
curb or edge of pavement of the parking lot) may count towards satisfying this
requirement; and,
         (2)   Landscaping in and/or around parking lots containing five (5) or
fewer parking spaces shall contain one or more deciduous trees that, when
mature, will expectedly provide approximately 50% shade coverage to that lot -
this connotates that the tree(s) canopy(ies) will extend over one or more
portions of the paved lot to provide [the] 50% coverage (as measured during
summer solstice).
      2.   Parking Lot Landscape Strips and Islands Standards:
         a.   All open-air parking lots designed for, or containing, five (5)
or more parking spaces (whether emplaced with new construction or in
conjunction with substantial (i.e., 50% plus re-construction or expansion of
[a] building[s] on a property) shall provide landscaping in accordance with the
provisions of this sub-section 2 that follow hereafter.
         b.   Interior parking lot landscape design shall meet one (1) of the
following options designed to provide approximately fifty percent (50%) tree
canopy coverage within twenty (20) years:
            (1)   Option One - Landscaped Strips: Landscape strips set
perpendicular to the head-end of parking spaces within a parking bank may be
employed (see Figure 1 hereafter).
Figure 1. Landscaped Strip(s)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fdc4500197b42dd173e6a1c15abb1d99c21d8fb9/
IMAGES/0-0-0-5285.png]
When used, such strips shall meet the following minimum requirement(s):
               A.   They shall be a least five-feet (5') wide/deep; and,
Exception: When the strip(s) will serve as vegetated drainage swales, the
minimum width/depth of a/the strip(s) shall be eight-feet (8'); and,
               B.   One Class II deciduous tree (selected from the City's
approved/adopted Tree Selection Guide's picklist) shall be planted at each end
of a parking strip and, for any parking bank [or double bank] at least ninety-
feet (90') feet long, at a centered [45' interval] position in between the "end
trees".
            (2)   Option Two - Landscaped Islands: Landscape [tree] islands
that serve as parking space interrupts and endcaps within a parking bank (or
double bank) may be employed (see Figure 2 hereafter).
Figure 2. Landscaped Islands
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/fdc4500197b42dd173e6a1c15abb1d99c21d8fb9/
IMAGES/0-0-0-5283.png]
When used, such tree planter islands shall meet the following minimum
requirement(s):
               A.   They shall be set parallel to abutting parking spaces as
illustrated in Figure 2 above at intervals not to exceed seventy-two feet
(72'); and,
               B.   They shall be of the same size/dimension as adjoining
parking stalls. For example, if located in a single row of ninety degree (90°)
oriented parking spaces that are nine feet (9') wide by eighteen feet (18')
deep/long, a landscape planter shall also be, correspondingly, nine feet (9')
wide and eighteen (18') deep). Where two (2) parking rows adjoin each other
"head to head", back to back planters may be used. If placed back to back in,
for example, a pair of ninety degree (90°) oriented parking rows, then the
resulting planters would likely appear to be a single nine foot (9') wide by
thirty-six foot (36') deep/long planter (see Figure 2 above hereafter); and

               C.   They shall be protected/wrapped by a curb that is at least
a six-inches (6") high.
               D.   Drainage Channel: A one foot (1') shall be provided at the
back end of, or within, a parking planter's abutment against a curb or other
barrier in order to facilitate site drainage (e.g., stormwater flow across a
parking lot into a drain) -- see Figure 3 above:
Exception: Any parking bank/row located immediately fronting/against any
principal commercial or multiple-family residential building on a property and
between the limits/span of its exterior side walls, such placement in front of
the building is, and shall be, optional. In other words, if a parking bank
abuts the front entry area of non-single-family residential building and
extends past the outside walls of that building, then planters shall be
required where any continuous ninety-foot (90') parking space intervals are
found past the end/side walls (see Figure 4 hereafter):

IMAGES/0-0-0-5279.png]
      3.   Landscape(d) areas shall be concaved [in slope] to allow storm water
infiltration; and
      4.   Plants used to improve any of the fore-going listed landscape areas
(i.e., parking lot periphery and internal planter strips or islands) shall
comply with the following requirements:
         a.   Primary plant materials used therein shall be deciduous shade
trees; and,
         b.   Shade trees planted in, and around, parking lots shall be limited
those species listed in the City's approved Tree Selection Guide's picklist);
and
         c.   Shade trees planted, in and around, parking lots shall be at
least 2" in caliper; and
         d.   Ornamental trees [e.g., Class I types], shrubbery, hedges, and
other plants may be used to supplement the shade tree plantings in perimeter
planting areas, but shall not be the only plants used in such landscaping.
         e.   When low impact development infiltration is infeasible (according
to the Storm Drainage System Design and Management Manual, Chapter 11), the
area of LID designs with underdrains or impermeable liners may be credited
towards the required numbers of trees at the rate of two hundred (200) square
feet of LID area equal to one (1) tree; up to fifty percent (50%) of the number
of required trees.
         f.   Interior parking lot landscaping areas shall also be planted with
ground cover at a density that will achieve thirty-five percent (35%) coverage
within two (2) years.
      5.   All grade-level parking should be separated from the street and
screened from pedestrian view by landscaping. The landscaping shall include
shrubs and trees, be located on private property, and, be wide enough to
maintain the plant material as well as provide a view screen.
      6.   All parking and landscaped areas shall be separated from the parking
surface by at least a six-inch (6") high concrete, continuous curb.
      7.   All landscaped and pedestrian areas shall be protected from
encroachment by parked cars. Accordingly, eighteen-inch (18") wide concrete
wheel stops shall be emplaced at the head end of parking spaces - save those
stalls that are established for parallel parking (see Figure 5 hereafter).

   C.    Parking Structures: Parking structures shall be screened with live
plant material that is intended to hide or obscure the sides of the structures
from public view.
D.   Re-construction of a Parking Lot: When a parking lot is expanded, or torn
up and then reconstructed (as opposed to being just resealed and/or striped)
only the renovated portion shall be improved to comply with current landscape
development code(s), including [any] engineering, water, wastewater or fire
division/department improvement regulations including, but not limited to,
curbing, gutter, sidewalk, storm drainage facilities, landscaping, light
fixtures, etc. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013; amd. Ord. 2021-09, 4-8-2021; Ord. 2021-
27, 10-14-2021; Ord. 2022-14, 6-16-2022)
13.77.070: LANDSCAPE BUFFERS:
   A.   Purpose: The landscape requirements in this section are intended to
ensure that abutting land uses are adequately protected and are provided an
appropriate amount of land separation to conduct permitted uses without causing
adverse impacts.
   B.   Applicability: The landscape buffer is required for all nonresidential
uses sharing a lot line with an abutting residential zone or residential land
use or by requirement of an approval granted by a land use authority under
provisions of this title.
   C.   Standards:
      1.   The width of the buffer is determined by the requirements of section
13.77.050 of this chapter unless modified by the land use authority as part of
a site plan approval as allowed by other provisions of this title, however, no
landscaped buffer shall be smaller than that required for the health and growth
of the plants and trees contained within the required buffer area.
      2.   The materials within the required buffer between abutting land uses
are regulated as follows:
         a.   All buffer areas shall be comprised of materials such as, a mix
of evergreens and deciduous trees, water efficient shrubs or vegetative ground
cover or up to fifty percent (50%) nonvegetative mulch or other hardscape as
defined by section
13.77.040 of this chapter.
         b.   Fences, walls and berms may also be incorporated in the buffer
areas where they will not create a public safety hazard.
      3.   Where trees are incorporated, the required buffer area shall result
in a barrier where trees touch at the time of the tree maturity.
      4.   Where existing or proposed abutting land uses cannot be adequately
buffered with plant materials, the land use authority may require inclusion of
a wall, fence or other type of screen that mitigates noise, and/or unsightly
uses. All fences, walls, or other screens must comply with the regulations of
section
13.76.710 of this title.
      5.   Chainlink fencing with or without slats does not qualify as
screening material.
      6.   All buffers between different land uses may include any required
perimeter parking lot landscape buffers. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013; amd. Ord.
2015-02, 2-5-2015; Ord. 2022-14, 6-16-2022)
13.77.080: TREE CANOPY SUSTAINABILITY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to protect critical tree canopy
resources in Holladay. These resources are important to community identity, the
enhancement of air and water quality, and, the promotion of property values.
Tools to accomplish these values are to:
      1.   Replace trees that are removed due to specified building and
construction activities;
      2.   Strengthen the protection of trees along specified creeks and
canals; and
      3.   Address and regulate the mass clearing of trees on unoccupied
property.
   B.   Application: The regulations contained in this chapter shall only apply
to:
      1.   Protected trees as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title. The regulations contained in this chapter shall not
apply to high risk trees that are solely on private property unless otherwise
regulated in section
13.77.090 of this chapter;
      2.   Demolition, building or development activities requiring a permit
under
chapter 13.08 of this title for commercial, office, single family residential,
multi-family residential, and public, quasi-public or private institutional
development, including all new construction, structural additions or additional
impervious surface coverage that results in a reduction of the existing tree
canopy;
      3.   Activities requiring a grading or filling permit under section
13.76.700 of this title; and
      4.   Clear cutting of trees.
   C.   Permit Requirement: When a permit is required for the expansion of
building footprint, demolition of a structure, for initial construction or
reconstruction, or for grading or clear cutting as required by
chapter 13.08, or section
13.76.700 of this title, the applicant shall provide either:
      1.   A statement of no tree impact with documentation supported by
reliable aerial or other legitimate and acceptable imagery, or
      2.   A tree canopy sustainability plan that provides for the preservation
or replacement of the same minimum square feet of tree canopy coverage
identified on the inventory described in subsection D of this section.
   D.   Tree Canopy Sustainability Plan:
      1.   Compliance: A Tree Canopy Sustainability Plan provided in compliance
with subsection C2 of this section shall include:
         a.   An inventory of the tree canopy including heritage trees,
proposed for removal;
         b.   An inventory of any tree canopy removed within one year prior to
the date of an application which has been submitted to the City pursuant to
either
chapter 13.08 or 13.76 of this title; and
         c.   A list of proposed replacement trees with an estimated canopy
coverage that will, at maturity, achieve tree canopy coverage no less than the
tree canopy coverage to be removed.
      2.   Removal: The Community Development Director or designee shall
approve a tree sustainability canopy plan if the submitted plan demonstrates
that the removal of an existing tree on the lot is required due to one or more
of the following:
         a.   The tree originates within the net buildable area of a given site
as identified on the tree survey and site plan by the applicant;
         b.   A tree is located where it interferes with a proposed right- of-
way, easement or ingress/egress to the site that cannot be reconfigured;
         c.   The tree is located where it interferes with the installation,
delivery, or maintenance of proposed or existing utility services to the site;
         d.   The tree is located where it creates a safety or health hazard or
a nuisance with respect to existing or proposed structures or vehicles or
pedestrian routes and there is no reasonable alternative to relocate or
reconfigure the improvements;
         e.   The trees are determined by the Community Development Director,
designee, or by a certified arborist or other licensed tree care professional
to be high risk as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title; or
         f.   The tree unreasonably prevents development of a lot or parcel or
the physical use and enjoyment thereof.
      3.   Review Fee: A seventy five dollar ($75.00) fee shall be assessed to
review and approve a Tree Canopy Sustainability Plan.
   E.   Tree Removal Permit:
      1.   A no-fee tree removal permit is required for:
         a.   The removal of any heritage tree, as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title;
         b.   The removal of street trees and waterway trees including high
risk trees in those areas;
         c.   Any increase in impervious surface area for which a building
permit is required which results in loss of existing tree canopy.
      2.   Prior to development of a lot or parcel, a portion of the tree
canopy may be removed not to exceed the same square footage of canopy allowed
by the maximum impervious surface coverage restrictions of this title.
   F.   Replacement Of Protected Trees Required: Replacement trees shall comply
with the following schedule and requirements:
      1.   No less than fifty percent (50%) of replacement trees must be
replaced on the property where they were removed. No more than fifty percent
(50%) of replacement trees may be planted off-site as allowed in subsection G,
"Off-Site Replacement", of this section.
      2.   A deciduous tree that is removed shall be replaced by a tree with a
minimum tree size of one and a half inch (11/2") caliper of a variety that has
the potential to reach a mature canopy coverage of that of the removed tree.
      3.   A coniferous tree that is removed shall be replaced by at least one
coniferous tree with a minimum height of eight feet (8') or replaced by a
deciduous equivalent as per subsection F2 of this section.
      4.   Replacement trees shall be planted, relocated, or preserved before
issuance of a certificate of occupancy or similar authorization.
      5.   Replacement trees shall be maintained by the property owner through
an establishment period of at least three (3) years.
   G.   Off-Site Replacement: In lieu of one hundred percent (100%) replacement
of the on-site tree canopy, the developer/applicant may request an off-site
replacement permit for no more than fifty percent (50%) of the lost tree
canopy.
      1.   An application for an off-site replacement permit must be
accompanied by a signed approval from the tree "receiving" property owner and
documentation of the planting prior to occupancy of the tree "sending"
property.
      2.   The Community Development Director, or designee, may approve an
alternative replacement mitigation plan only after first making all of the
following findings:
         a.   The applicant has investigated alternative site designs and
building footprints using existing development standards;
         b.   Placing the required number of replacement trees on site with
proposed final tree canopy is not conducive to a sustainable landscape plan for
the property in question;
         c.   The spacing selection of the proposed replacement trees and the
landscape design contribute to the City's long-term goals of a sustainable
urban forest.
   H.   Tree/Vegetation Protection During Construction And Grading Activities:
In order to protect tree canopy on a property during construction, limits of
disturbance as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title, shall be shown on the final tree canopy sustainability
plan and shall be clearly delineated on site with fencing or other materials or
methods prior to the commencement of excavation, grading, or construction
activities on the site to preserve the viability of existing tree resources.
   I.   Appeals: A person adversely affected by a decision of the Community
Development Director regarding issuance or compliance with a tree removal
permit may appeal such decision to the Administrative Appeals Officer.
   J.   Expiration: A tree removal permit shall expire and have no further
force or effect if the tree removal activity or construction is not commenced
within one year of the date of the issuance of the tree removal permit.
   K.   Penalty: Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of an infraction which shall be punishable by a fine of
not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00). (Ord. 2018-18, 11-8-2018)
13.77.090: STREET/COMMUNITY/WATERWAY TREE SUSTAINABILITY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to protect existing street
trees on City-owned property and along certain waterways within the City, to
require replacement of removed trees in those areas, and to require planting of
street trees within new developments. This section is intended to:
      1.   Preserve the visual and aesthetic qualities of the City's tree lined
streetscapes and waterways;
      2.   Encourage the preservation and replacement of trees in those areas;
and
      3.   Enhance, stabilize, promote and protect property values throughout
the City of Holladay.
   B.   Application: The provisions of this section shall apply to all real
property located in the City of Holladay, which is in the public right-of-way,
on City owned property or in riparian areas along the natural and manmade

13.77.100: PLANTING GUIDELINES:
   A.   Minimum Plant Sizes: The following are minimum plant sizes for all
required landscape areas:
TABLE 13.77.101
 
Type Of Tree    Minimum Size
Coniferous tree 6 foot height
Ornamental tree 2 inch caliper
Shade tree      2 inch caliper
Woody shrubs    2 gallon size container
 
   B.   Plant Species: Plant species proven adaptable to the local climate
should be used in all landscaping plans.
   C.   Tree Preservation: Wherever possible, existing significant trees as
defined in section
13.04.040 of this title should be preserved.
      1.   Preliminary plans shall show all significant trees within the
proposed development and the associated limits of disturbance for each
significant tree(s).
      2.   No construction, grading, equipment or material storage or any other
activity shall be allowed within the limits of disturbance established for all
significant trees.
         a.   Within the limits of disturbance, fencing, at a minimum, should
be placed around each significant tree and around stands of twelve (12) or more
smaller trees a distance equal to the size of the individual or outermost
tree's drip zone.
         b.   For purposes of this subsection, the drip zone is calculated by
measuring the diameter of the tree at breast height. Every inch of tree trunk
diameter equates to one foot (1') of drip zone.
         c.   Fencing shall remain in place until all land alteration,
construction, and development activities are completed.
      3.   If it is necessary to fill over the root zone, compacted soils shall
be avoided by sandwiching fabric, rocks and more fabric under the area to be
filled.
      4.   Fill placed directly on the roots shall not exceed a maximum of six
inches (6") in depth.
      5.   If fill creates a tree well or depression around a tree or shrubs,
such area shall be drained so that the vegetation is not drowned by the pooling
of rainfall or irrigation.
      6.   If a tree's roots must be cut, the branches shall be trimmed by an
amount equal to the percent of roots that were lost. Roots shall be pruned
cleanly prior to digging and not ripped off by heavy equipment. Cutting more
than thirty percent (30%) of the roots endangers the health of the tree, and
over forty percent (40%) affects the tree's stability.
      7.   Utility trenches near trees should be avoided. If a line must be
near a tree, tunneling, auguring, or other mitigation measures shall be used.
   D.   Planting Areas: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required
landscaped area shall be planted with live plant materials. The remaining fifty
percent (50%) may consist of permeable hardscape improvements as allowed by
subsection
13.77.040D of this chapter. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013)
13.77.110: LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Purpose: The regulations of this section are intended to ensure that
all required landscaping is maintained in a healthy, growing condition at all
times.
   B.   Applicability: The requirement for landscape maintenance applies in all
zones where landscaping has been required.
   C.   Standards:
      1.   The property owner is responsible for the maintenance of all
landscaping and screening devices required by this chapter.
      2.   Plant materials that exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease, and/
or damage shall be appropriately treated to correct the problem. Dead plant
materials shall be replaced.
      3.   All landscaping required by this section may be subject to periodic
inspections by city officials to determine compliance with the provisions of
this title.
      4.   The lower branches of trees shall be pruned and maintained as
required by sections
14.12.040 and
14.12.050 of this code. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013)
13.77.120: INSTALLATION:
   A.   Substitutions: All substitutions of plant material on an approved
landscape plan must be approved by the community development director.
   B.   Inspections: Landscaping shall be installed and completed in compliance
with the approved landscape plan. A certificate of occupancy shall not be
issued until the improvements are inspected and approved by the community
development director, unless an assurance is provided and approved according to
subsection C of this section.
   C.   Assurance: In extenuating circumstances where occupancy or final
inspection is requested prior to completion of landscaping, the owner or
developer shall enter into an enforcement delay agreement with the city
certifying that the required landscaping will be completed within the next
planting season at a date specified by the community development director but
not to exceed one year. Violation of this agreement is subject to zoning
enforcement. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013; amd. Ord. 2023-10, 9-7-2023)
13.77.130: ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF:
The city recognizes that the specific landscape requirements set forth herein
cannot and do not anticipate all possible landscape situations. A certain
amount of flexibility in the application of such requirements is necessary in
cases where the requirements are inapplicable or inappropriate to a specific
use, design or site proposal. A written request for relief may be submitted to
the land use authority in conjunction with the applicable development proposal,
including an explanation of the findings and justification necessary to grant
administrative relief.
   A.   The land use authority as part of a site plan approval may reduce the
minimum needed landscaping up to ten percent (10%) after taking into
consideration:
      1.   The location and size of parking lots and/or structures, the layout
of the buildings, the topography and geometry of the site and other
environmental factors;
      2.   The exclusion of natural areas for reasons of preservation;
      3.   A commensurate or additional percent of landscaping is being
provided in an abutting right of way by permission of the owner of the right of
way.
      4.   An increase of the impervious surface coverage has been accomplished
by the methods shown in section
13.14.080,
table 13.14.080C of this title;
   B.   The land use authority shall document in writing any such findings
granting administrative relief. (Ord. 2013-22, 9-5-2013)

13.78.130: Scope Of Planning Commission Action
13.78.010: SCOPE OF APPROVAL:
Provision of a planned unit development by this chapter in no way guarantees a
property owner the right to exercise the provisions of the planned unit
development. Planned unit developments may be approved by the planning
commission as a conditional use only if, in its judgment, the proposed planned
unit development fully meets the intent and purpose, and requirements of the
land use ordinance and the general plan. (Ord. 2014-06, 5-1-2014)
13.78.020: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of planned unit development is to permit flexibility in
land use, allow diversification in the interrelationships of various uses and
structures with their sites and thus offer an alternative to conventional
development. The application of planned unit development concepts is intended
to encourage unique neighborhoods, high quality housing, exceptional design,
additional open space, and facilities compatible with the present living
environment in the city. Ensuring compliance with the purpose of this section
protects the health, safety and public welfare of the future inhabitants of, or
visitors to, the planned unit development. At the same time, securing the
advantages of imaginative site planning for residential, commercial development
or combinations thereof, as well as maximizing the energy utilization
efficiency of the project. The objective is to preserve existing greenery and
significant trees on site. The planned unit development process must create
unique benefits for both the property owner and the city even though it does
not allow additional density. Applicants must justify to the planning
commission why the project would be better for the community than a project
developed as the underlying zoning would normally allow. Development under the
planned unit development process is a privilege that must be earned by the
developer, not a right that must be granted by the planning commission.
   B.   Through the flexibility of the planned unit development regulations,
the city seeks to achieve the following specific objectives:
      1.   The stabilization and preservation of the existing or planned land
uses in abutting areas and surrounding residential neighborhoods;
      2.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such
as natural topography, vegetation and geologic features, and the prevention of
soil erosion;
      3.   Preservation of buildings which are architecturally or historically
significant or contribute to the character of the city;
      4.   Maximizing and preserving vegetation and open space and/or other
special development amenities to provide light, air and privacy, to buffer
abutting properties and to provide active and passive recreation opportunities
for residents of the planned development and/or the community;
      5.   Minimize significant through traffic impacts on adjacent residential
neighborhoods;
      6.   Provide an appropriate transition or buffering between uses of
differing intensities both on site and off site; and
      7.   Provide safe and convenient vehicle and pedestrian connections
between adjacent uses. (Ord. 2014-06, 5-1-2014)
13.78.030: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DEFINED:
MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: For the purpose of this chapter means an
integrated design for a planned unit development which includes a combination
of residential and nonresidential uses.
NONRESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: For the purpose of this chapter, means
an integrated design for development of commercial uses which does not include
any residential component.
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: For the purpose of this chapter, means a coordinated,
integrated design for development of residential, nonresidential, commercial,
or a combination of such uses.
RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: For the purpose of this chapter, means an
integrated design for a planned unit development which includes only
residential uses. (Ord. 2014-06, 5-1-2014)
13.78.040: SUBMISSION, REVIEW AND APPROVAL; SITE PLAN AND CONDITIONAL USE

chapter 13.100, "Appendix A - Allowed Uses", of this title.
   B.   Three Step Review Of Site Plan: A planned unit development site plan
shall be considered in three (3) steps as required by section
13.08.010 of this title. (Ord. 2016-04, 4-14-2016)
   C.   Review And Approval Of A Conditional Use: The planning commission shall
consider the conditional use application at a public hearing. The City shall
provide notice as per "Conditional Use Permit" noticing procedures as required
in Appendix C: "Noticing Requirements" of Title 13.
      1.   A copy of the planning commission's agenda shall be posted as
required in Appendix C: "Noticing Requirements" of Title 13. (Ord. 2016-27, 11-
3-2016)
   D.   Submission Requirements:
      1.   The applicant shall submit a standard subdivision design, using the
minimum lot size, width, and setback dimensions required by the zone, to
calculate the maximum allowable number of dwellings ("maximum density") for the
development.
      2.   The applicant shall submit a planned unit development site plan for
the total area within the proposed development as required by
chapter 13.03 of this title.
         a.   The site plan shall show, where pertinent:
            (1)   The use or uses, dimensions, sketch elevations and locations
of proposed structures;
            (2)   Dimensions and locations of areas to be reserved and
developed for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking, public uses such
as schools and playgrounds, landscaping, and other open spaces;
            (3)   Architectural drawings and sketches outlining the general
design and character of the proposed uses and the physical relationships of the
uses; and
            (4)   Such other pertinent information such as, residential
density, coverage and open space characteristics as may be necessary to make a
determination that the proposed arrangement of buildings and uses makes it
desirable to apply regulations and requirements differing from those ordinarily
applicable under this title.
         b.   An explanation of how the proposed planned unit development
satisfies the purposes set forth in section
13.78.020 of this chapter.
         c.   If the planned unit development is to be developed on a phase
basis, each phase shall be of such size, composition and arrangement that its
construction, marketing and operation is feasible as a unit independent of any
subsequent phases.
   E.   Waiver Of Zone District Regulations: To allow flexibility and
initiative in site and building design, the planning commission may waive or
vary one or more of the land use regulations as required by the zone in which
the planned unit development is proposed, other than:
      1.   Use regulations;
      2.   Overall building height regulations, including graduated height
restrictions; and
      3.   Density.
   F.   Limitations: A conditional use permit shall not be granted unless the
planned unit development meets the use limitations of the zoning district in
which it is to be located and meets the density and other limitations of such
districts.
   G.   Compliance With The Subdivision Regulations: Compliance with the
regulations of this chapter does not excuse the developer from the applicable
requirements of the subdivision regulations, as required by
chapter 13.10 of this title, except as modifications thereof are specifically
authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development.
   H.   Planning Commission: The planning commission may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny a planned unit development based upon written findings of
fact according to each of the following standards. It is the responsibility of
the applicant to provide written and graphic evidence demonstrating compliance
with the following standards:
      1.   Planned Unit Development Objectives: The planned unit development
shall meet the purpose statement for a planned unit development (section
13.78.020 of this chapter);
      2.   Master Plan And Zoning Ordinance Compliance: The proposed planned
unit development shall be:
         a.   Consistent with any adopted policy set forth in the future land
use map applicable to the site where the planned unit development will be
located, and
         b.   Allowed by the zone where the planned unit development will be
located.
      3.   Compatibility: The proposed planned unit development shall be
compatible with the character of the site, adjacent properties, and existing
development within the vicinity of the site where the use will be located. In
determining compatibility, the planning commission shall consider:
         a.   Whether the street or other means of access to the site provide
the necessary ingress/egress without materially degrading the service level on
such street/access or any adjacent street/access;
         b.   Whether the planned unit development and its location will create
unusual pedestrian or vehicle traffic patterns or volumes that would not be
expected, based on:
            (1)   Orientation of driveways and whether they direct traffic to
major or local streets, and, if directed to local streets, the impact on the
safety, purpose, and character of these streets;
            (2)   Parking area locations and size, and whether parking plans
are likely to encourage street side parking for the planned unit development
which will adversely impact the reasonable use of adjacent property;
            (3)   Hours of peak traffic to the proposed planned unit
development and whether such traffic will unreasonably impair the use and
enjoyment of adjacent property.
         c.   Whether the internal circulation system of the proposed planned
unit development will be designed to mitigate adverse impacts on adjacent
property from motorized, nonmotorized, and pedestrian traffic;
         d.   Whether existing or proposed utility and public services will be
adequate to support the proposed planned unit development at normal service
levels and will be designed in a manner to avoid adverse impacts on adjacent
land uses, public services, and utility resources;
         e.   Whether appropriate buffering or other mitigation measures, such
as, but not limited to, landscaping, setbacks, building location, sound
attenuation, odor control, will be provided to protect adjacent land uses from
excessive light, noise, odor and visual impacts and other unusual disturbances
from trash collection, deliveries, and mechanical equipment resulting from the
proposed planned unit development; and
         f.   Whether the mass and scale of the intended buildings/structures,
the intended uses within the planned unit development, and the intensity, size,
and scale of the entire planned unit development are compatible with
surrounding properties. (Ord. 2014-06, 5-1-2014; amd. Ord. 2016-04, 4-14-2016;

Prior to beginning a project involving the installation or upgrading of four
(4) or more poles, a utility/facility company providing electrical power for
general consumption shall send written notification of the project to all
abutting property owners and the director of public works. The purpose of such
notification is to allow potentially affected property owners an opportunity to
discuss with the company possible methods of providing and paying for
undergrounding of proposed systems and provide the city the opportunity to meet
with the company to discuss the project. Such notification shall be sent during
the company's planning process to allow reasonable and sufficient time for such
discussion to occur, but in no event less than sixty (60) days prior to the
scheduled installation. Such notification shall include a full description of
the project, including, but not limited to: a) the need for the project; b)
location of the project; c) height, width, type and general location of poles;
and d) amount of voltage. Failure of property owners to receive notice of the
project shall in no way affect the validity of action taken. Failure to reach

established, off street parking spaces for automobiles in accordance with the
requirements in this chapter.
   B.   Plans Required To Obtain Building Permit: All applications for a
building permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan showing the required
parking spaces, with ingress and egress. The plan shall be reviewed and
approved by the Community and Economic Development Department.
   C.   Alternatives To On Site Parking: The required off street parking for
any new use, structure or building which, due to the size or location of the
parcel, cannot be provided on the premises may be provided on other property
not more than a three hundred foot (300') distance from the building site
measured along the shortest available pedestrian route of access upon a finding
by the Planning Commission that the off site parking is conveniently located
for such use and will not create a traffic or safety problem. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-
20-2012; amd. Ord. 2022-22, 11-17-2022)

of nine feet (9') and a minimum length of eighteen feet (18'), in accordance
with table 1 of this section. If the stall is perpendicular to a curb, the
length shall be measured from the curb face. Each parking stall shall have
independent access from a driving aisle. A parking stall may contain less than
eighteen feet (18') of pavement in length if all of the following conditions
are met:
      1.   The stall has a standard six inch (6") curb face that will allow
vehicles to extend over a landscaped area of no less than six feet (6') in
total width;
      2.   Each stall contains no less than sixteen feet (16') of pavement in
length measured from curb face;

   B.   Location: Required parking stalls shall not be located in delivery
areas, service driveways, driving aisles, drive-in stacking lanes, shopping
cart storage areas, or areas in front of overhead service doors. Designated
loading space shall not encroach into any fire lane or pedestrian pathway.
   C.   Separation From Rights-Of-Way: Except as provided above, wheel or
bumper guards shall be placed in parking stalls where necessary to prevent any
part of a standard sized vehicle from extending beyond a parking stall boundary
line, intruding on a pedestrianway, or contacting any wall, fence, or planting.
A physical separation or barrier, such as vertical curbs, may be required in
order to separate parking stalls from access to a second travel lane.
   D.   Layout: All off street parking stalls shall be designed in accordance
with the dimensions and specifications set forth in tables 1 and 2 of this
section.
   E.   Accessibility Requirements: All parking facilities shall comply with
accessibility requirements of the City's then current Building Code. The number

implied by the use that any stall is reserved for exclusive use by the
business.
   E.   Number Of Parking Spaces For Uses Not Specified: For any use of
building not specified in this section, the off street parking requirement
shall be determined by the community development director being guided, where

HIGHWAY NOISE ABATEMENT MEASURES
SECTION:
13.81.010: Findings
13.81.020: Purpose Of Provisions
13.81.030: Development Of Property Abutting Certain State Highways
13.81.040: Responsibility Of Owner Or Developer
13.81.010: FINDINGS:
   A.   The federal highway administration (FHWA) regulation entitled
"procedures for abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise" (23
CFR 772) provides procedures for noise studies and noise abatement measures to
help protect the public health and welfare, supplies noise abatement criteria,
and establishes requirements for information to be given to local officials for
use in the planning and design of federal aid highways. The Utah department of
transportation (UDOT) policy entitled "noise abatement" (policy 08-111),
adopted pursuant to 23 CFR 772, addresses highway noise impacts and sets forth
conditions under which noise abatement projects may be approved and constructed
in the state with the use of federal aid highway participation funds.
   B.   In order for UDOT to obtain participation funds from FHWA for proposed
federal aid highway projects for noise abatement measures on existing highways
(known as "type II projects"), local authorities are required to take measures
"...to exercise land use control over the remaining undeveloped lands adjacent
to highways in the local jurisdiction to prevent further development of
incompatible activities", 23 CFR 772.13(b).
   C.   In an effort to prevent future traffic noise impacts on currently
undeveloped lands, section 23 CFR 772.15 requires that highway agencies shall
inform local officials within whose jurisdiction the highway project is located
of the following:
      1.   The best estimation of future noise levels (for various distances
from the highway improvement) for both developed and undeveloped lands or
properties in the immediate vicinity of the project;
      2.   Information that may be useful to local communities to protect
future land development from becoming incompatible with anticipated highway
noise levels; and
      3.   Eligibility for federal aid participation for type II projects as
described in section 23 CFR 772.13(b).
   D.   In order for city residents to benefit from the development and
implementation of type II projects for noise abatement along eligible highways
within its boundaries, it is found to be in the city's best interests to comply
with federal regulation and state policy by adopting this land use ordinance.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.81.020: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted for the purpose of promoting
the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city by
minimizing the potential adverse effects of highway traffic noise and by
complying with state and federal requirements for highway traffic noise
abatement projects. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.81.030: DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTY ABUTTING CERTAIN STATE HIGHWAYS:
Consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR 772 and UDOT's noise abatement
policy 08-111, no remaining undeveloped lands located in the city abutting type
II projects (freeways and expressways) shall be developed for any use or
activity which is incompatible with highway traffic noise levels, unless the
development of such lands shall include appropriate noise abatement measures
determined necessary and appropriate by the city and UDOT. A use or activity
shall be deemed incompatible with highway traffic noise levels when a "traffic
noise impact" occurs, as determined under the formula set forth as follows:

13.82.080: SIZE AND AREA COMPUTATION:
The following shall be used when calculating sign sizes and area:
   A.   When more than one use occupies a lot, the frontage may be used to
calculate the sign size for one total ground or projecting sign, not for each
use. The total may then be divided between the uses. There may be any number of
flat or wall signs, provided their total does not exceed the percentage of wall
area coverage allowed.
   B.   A property line that abuts a nonaccess freeway, road, street or right-
of-way may only be used in computing sign area when the property has no other
frontage or access on a dedicated street.
   C.   The area of a sign that is used for display purposes, excluding the
minimum frame and supports. In computing sign area, only one side of a back to
back or double faced sign shall be computed when signs are parallel or diverge
from a common edge by an angle of not more than forty five degrees (45°). In
relation to signs that do not have a frame or a separate background, sign area
shall be computed on the basis of the least rectilinear line with a maximum of
eight (8) sides, triangle or circle large enough to frame the display. Sign
areas in the shape of a sphere, prism, cylinder, cone, pyramid, square or other
such shapes shall be computed as one-half (1/2) of the total surface area.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
13.82.090: HEIGHT OF GROUND SIGNS:
The height of ground signs, except as otherwise specified in this chapter,

13.82.200: HOLLADAY VILLAGE SIGN REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The city council of Holladay finds and declares that by
controlling and standardizing signs in the Holladay Village, the regulations
set forth in this chapter will: create a unique environment to attract business
to the Holladay Village; allow each individual business to clearly identify
itself and the goods and services which it offers in a clear and distinctive
manner; safeguard and enhance property values; protect public and private
investment in buildings and open space; prevent confusing sign displays; and
promote the public health, safety and welfare of all of the citizens of
Holladay.
   B.   New Signs: It is intended that new signs in the village follow the
historic patterns compatible with small scale buildings and pedestrian
activity. Signs should be generally discreet. Flat mounted plaques, painted
signboards and hanging fin signs are encouraged. Signs should be designed to
fit the scale of the building. Sign text should be clear and minimal.
Illumination should be accomplished by the use of external fixtures and subtle
lighting colors. Internally illuminated or backlit plastic signs do not belong
in a unique pedestrian oriented context (see illustrations in section
13.71.100 of this title).

   C.   Intent: The following regulations are intended to encourage signs,
which by their good design, are integrated with and are harmonious to the
character of the buildings and sites that they occupy and are a valuable
contribution to the overall ambience of the village (HV) business district.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
   D.   Signs Allowed In The Holladay Village (HV) District: For all signs in
the HV zone the following regulations apply:
      1.   Total Sign Area Requirements: For signs either attached parallel to
a building facade or freestanding monument signs, the following regulations
apply:

exceed the following:
CHART 13.82.200.01
 
Floor Area Of Business Sign Area Total; Wall     Sign Area Total;
                                                 Freestanding

D8a of this section. (Ord. 2016-23, 9-22-2016)
      2.   Area Of Individual Signs:
         a.   The area of a sign shall include the entire area within any type
of perimeter or border that may enclose the outer limits of any writing,
representation, emblem, figure, or character, exclusive of the supporting
framework.
         b.   When the sign faces of a backed sign, i.e., projecting, hanging,
or freestanding signs are parallel or within thirty degrees (30°) of parallel,
only one sign face is counted into the total sign area. If the sign faces are
not parallel or within thirty degrees (30°) of parallel, each sign face is
counted into the total sign area.
      3.   Location On Building: The location of a sign on a structure or
building has a major impact on the overall architecture of the building. To
ensure that signs enhance this architecture, the following criteria must be
met:
         a.   Wall signs may not extend above the building parapet, soffit, the
eave line or the roof of the building, or the windowsill of the second story.
         b.   A sign, including its supporting structure and components, shall
be designed as an integral design element of a building's architecture and
shall be architecturally compatible, including color, with the building to
which it is attached.
         c.   Signs must not significantly obscure architectural details of the
building, nor cover doors, windows, or other integral elements of the facade.
         d.   Signs should complement the visual continuity of adjacent
building facades and relate directly to the entrance.
         e.   Signs shall not obstruct views of nearby intersections and
driveways.
         f.   Signs shall not obstruct views of other signs. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-
20-2012)
      4.   Projections And Clearance:
         a.   No portion of a sign may project more than forty two inches (42")
from the face of a building or pole unless the sign is part of a permanent
marquee or awning over the sidewalk.
         b.   Projecting signs, awnings or canopies must maintain at least
eight feet (8') of clearance from ground level.
         c.   Signs may extend over city property only after review by the city
engineer and with the written approval of the community development director
and lease agreement acceptable to the city attorney.
         d.   Awning, or canopy signs must comply with the following
regulations:
            (1)   No canopy or awning sign may be erected, reerected, located
or relocated or enlarged or modified structurally without approval of the city.
            (2)   Awning or canopy signs must be located in a traditional
manner above doors, windows or walkways, provided said walkway leads to a bona
fide entrance, if they are compatible with the architecture of the building and
follow relevant design guideline criteria. All other locations are prohibited.
            (3)   Only fire resistant fabrics will be permitted. Material
should be high quality, colorfast and sun fade resistant. The planning
commission must approve vinyl or plastic materials.
            (4)   Freestanding awnings and canopy signs are prohibited.
            (5)   An awning or canopy attached to a building may extend over
the public right of way and project a maximum of thirty six inches (36") from
the face of a building unless the awning or canopy is designed to extend over
the sidewalk.
            (6)   A maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the drop face of the
awning or canopy sign may be used for sign area regardless of the size of the
building facade to which the sign applies, but not to exceed the area of a sign
which would be allowed otherwise. Awning and canopy signs are calculated as
part of the total sign area for a building.
            (7)   Awning or canopy signs must have a minimum clearance of eight
feet (8') above the sidewalk.
            (8)   If the awning or canopy becomes a hazard, with reasonable
notice, the city may require that an awning or canopy be removed from over city
right of way without compensating the building owner. (Ord. 2016-23, 9-22-2016)
      5.   Freestanding Monument Signs:
         a.   Permanent, freestanding monument signs must be located a minimum
of three feet (3') behind the right of way line.
         b.   A building or complex may not display more than one monument sign
on each street frontage.
         c.   The sign shall be architecturally compatible with the style,
materials, colors and details of the building. The sign content should be
integrated into a single design.
         d.   The maximum height for any freestanding monument sign within ten
feet (10') of the right of way is four feet (4'). Signs set back beyond ten
feet (10') the maximum height is six feet (6').
      6.   Sign Materials: Exposed surfaces of signs may be constructed of
metal, glass, stone, concrete, high density foam board, brick, solid wood, or
reinforced fabrics. All sign materials should be compatible with the face of
the building and should be colorfast and resistant to corrosion. Other
materials may be approved by the planning commission if the material meets the
intent of this subsection D6, but are otherwise prohibited.
      7.   Color: Bright and glossy fluorescent colors and reflective surfaces
are prohibited. Reflective colored materials that give the appearance of
changing color are also prohibited. Colors should complement the color scheme
of the building. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
      8.   Illumination: The purpose of regulating sign illumination is to
prevent light trespass and provide clear illumination of signs without causing
potential hazards to pedestrians and vehicles. It is the intent of this section
to encourage externally lit, appropriate signage.
         a.   Externally Illuminated Signs:
            (1)   Externally lit signs shall be illuminated only with steady,
stationary, shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign without
causing glare. Light sources and fixtures used for illuminating a sign shall be
simple in form and should not clutter the building or structure. Light bulbs or
lighting tubes should be shielded so as to not be physically visible from
abutting public rights of way or residential properties.
            (2)   The intensity of sign lighting shall not exceed that
necessary to illuminate and make legible a sign from the abutting travelway or
closest right of way.
            (3)   All light fixtures, conduit, and shielding shall be painted
to match either the building or the supporting structure that serves as the
background of the sign. (Ord. 2016-23, 9-22-2016)
         b.   Internally Illuminated Signs:
            (1)   Internally illuminated signs, which include any sign face lit
or outlined by a light source located within the sign, shall be prohibited,
except the following:
               (A)   Individual cutout letters (i.e., letters routed out of the
face of an opaque sign) can be backlit.
               (B)   Reversed pan channel letters with an internal light source
reflecting off of the building face may also be used for "halo" or "silhouette"
lighting.
            (2)   Strings of lights that outline buildings, building
architectural features, and surrounding trees, shall not flash, blink or
simulate motion. Colored lights shall be allowed from October 1 through January
15.
         c.   Prohibited Lighting: Lights which flash, rotate, blink or chase
in any manner, are prohibited.
         d.   Luminous Tube Signs: (Neon) luminous tubes (LT) used to draw
attention to a business or building in any manner, including, but not limited
to, neon text or logos are considered signs and shall be regulated according to
the provisions of this code as follows:
            (1)   All LT signs are limited to two (2) square feet.
            (2)   All LT signs shall be limited to application on the ground
floor of a building.
            (3)   LT signs must be located within a building and displayed
through a window rather than being attached to the exterior of the building.
(Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012)
      9.   Window Signs:
         a.   Window signs are limited to a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of
the transparent window area. Every effort should be made to integrate window
signs with the window display. Colors should be compatible with the building
facade.
         b.   Artistic, seasonal or historic displays or displays of goods
available inside the use are encouraged and are not considered signage.
      10.   Simulated Or Faux Window Signs: Where they are allowed by
subsection
13.71.090E of this title, simulated or faux windows may have up to one hundred
percent (100%) of the area covered in semipermanent or static graphics if:
         a.   The graphic is not a temporary sign as defined in section
13.04.040 of this title;
         b.   The graphic reflects the use within the building; and
         c.   The graphic is approved by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 2017-
01, 1-26-2017)
      11.   Umbrella Signs:
         a.   Signs on umbrellas are limited to a height of no more than five
inch (5") letters and graphics. Only the area of the umbrella containing the
signs, as opposed to the entire area of the umbrella, shall be considered for
purposes of calculating total sign area.
         b.   Materials should be of high quality vinyl, nylon, canvas or other
similar materials in order to withstand the weather and climate changes.
         c.   Umbrella colors are generally limited to single field color with
a single contrasting color for lettering and logos. However, if the umbrella is
striped, two (2) colors may be used. Corporate colors may be used, only if the
overall umbrella color scheme meets the general color standards of the HV Zone.
      12.   Master Sign Plan: When multiple signs for individual businesses are
contemplated for a major construction project, a master sign plan stipulating
the location and size of future signs will be required. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-
2012; amd. Ord. 2017-01, 1-26-2017)
      13.   Temporary Signs:
         a.   Temporary signs have a place in the community for specialized
purposes such as, but not limited to, announcing properties for sale or lease,
construction activities, temporary sales or for making political or ideological
statements. It is the intent of this section, however, to restrict the use of
temporary signs. Temporary signs are often poorly constructed, poorly
maintained and located in a manner that obscures traffic signs, views of
intersections of public and private streets and driveways and tends to
depreciate the beauty and quality of life in the community by creating visual
clutter.
         b.   Temporary signs are permitted in the HV but must be counted
toward the total sign area allowed in chart 13.82.200.01 of this section and
are permitted for thirty (30) days in each calendar year.
         c.   Temporary signs attached to or between telephone poles, fences,
fence poles, utility poles, public or private light poles, trees, vehicles, or
any other apparatus other than a building wall are prohibited, except those
public event signs erected by permission of Holladay City.
         d.   Only one (1) temporary wall sign is permitted on any one (1)
parcel of property. Additional window signs may also be used but may not exceed
the total sign area allowed per building face.
         e.   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, any
development of greater than two (2) acres which has received Final Site Plan
approval from the City may display a sign advertising and indicating the
development coming to the site. The sign shall be set back at least three feet
(3') from the property line and shall be no greater than sixty four (64) square
feet in size and shall be no more than twelve feet (12') off the ground at its
highest point. No sign shall be displayed until a building permit for the site
has been granted and the sign may only be displayed on one (1) street frontage.
Signs to be displayed under this section shall be approved by the City
Community Development Director and shall be permitted to be displayed for no
longer than nine (9) months. (Ord. 2017-08, 4-6-2017)
      14.   Prohibited Signs: All signs prohibited by this chapter are
prohibited in the HV Zone. (Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-2012; amd. Ord. 2017-01, 1-26-
2017)

      1.   Wall mounted antennas shall not extend above the wall line of the
building or structure or extend more than four feet (4') horizontally from the
face of the building or structure.
      2.   Antennas, equipment and the supporting structure shall be painted to
match the color of the building or structure or the background against which
they are most commonly seen. Antennas and the supporting structures on
buildings should be architecturally compatible with the building.
      3.   Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet walls, penthouses, or
mechanical equipment rooms, with no portion of the antenna extending above the
roofline of such structures, shall be considered a wall mounted antenna.
      4.   Stealth wall mounted antennas are encouraged and shall be allowed to
vary from the provisions of this section as determined by community development
for permitted uses and the Planning Commission for conditional uses. Stealth
wall mounted antennas are not required to be located with public or quasi-
public uses in all R-1 and R-2 Zones. (See section
13.83.050 of this chapter.)
   B.   Roof Mounted Antenna: The following provisions apply to roof mounted
antennas: (see figures in this subsection B)
      1.   Roof mounted antennas shall be allowed on top of existing penthouses
or mechanical equipment rooms, provided the antennas and antenna mounting
structures shall not extend more than eight feet (8') above the existing
roofline of the penthouse or mechanical equipment room.
      2.   For antennas not mounted on a penthouse or mechanical equipment room
and on a flat roof:
         a.   Setback: The antennas shall be mounted at least five feet (5')
from the exterior wall or parapet wall of a building or structure.
         b.   Height: The height shall be measured from the top of the antenna
to the roofline of the building or structure, or to the top of the parapet wall
if a parapet wall exists. For antennas mounted between five feet (5') and
fourteen feet (14') from the exterior wall or parapet wall, the maximum height
of the antenna is equal to the distance the antenna is set back from the
exterior wall or parapet wall. For antennas set back more than fourteen feet
(14'), the maximum height shall be fourteen feet (14'). Antennas extending more
than nineteen feet (19') above the roofline require conditional use approval.

event such as war, act of nature, strike, or civil disturbance.
         d.   Such other mitigating circumstances as may be approved by the
city attorney or designee.
         e.   If a change in the actual ownership of the property was recorded
in the recorder's office after the first or second notice was issued and the
new owner is not related by blood, marriage or common ownership to the prior
owner.

periodic payment of the applicable penalty.

have been agreed to by the hearing officer, the city may use such lawful means
as are available to collect such penalty, including costs and attorney fees.

The highway authorities of the city are authorized to plan, designate,
establish, regulate, vacate, alter, improve, maintain and provide limited
access facilities for public use whenever such authorities are of the opinion
that traffic conditions, present or future, will justify such special
facilities. The highway authorities of the city may also exercise, relative to
limited access facilities, any and all additional authority now or hereafter
vested in them relative to public highways within their respective
jurisdictions. Such authorities may regulate, restrict or prohibit the use of
such limited access facilities by pedestrians, animals or the various classes
of vehicles or traffic. (1999 Code)

14.18.020: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
   A.   Findings And Intent:
      1.   Findings Regarding Rights-Of-Way: The City Council of the City of
Holladay, Utah, finds that the rights-of-way within the City of Holladay
(hereinafter "City"):
         a.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of the City;
         b.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
         c.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic
well-being of the City and its citizens; and
         d.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
      2.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The City finds that the City should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
      3.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The City finds that while utility
systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also
involve rights-of-way, Municipal franchising, and vital business and community
service, which are of local concern.
      4.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Utility Services: The City finds that
it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid
development of utility services, including those utilizing emerging technology,
on a nondiscrimination basis, responsive to community and public interest, and
to assure availability for Municipal, educational and community services.
      5.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The City finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
         a.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
         b.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
         c.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm
that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
         d.   Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority
of the City, in a manner consistent with Federal and State law;
         e.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the City infrastructure;
         f.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-
of-way; and
         g.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act") [United States PL No.
104 - 104].
      6.   Power To Manage Rights-Of-Way: The City adopts this chapter pursuant
to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah
Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable,
compensation for the use of rights- of-way by providers as expressly set forth
by section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)
14.18.030: SCOPE OF CHAPTER:
This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of utility
services and systems that require the use of the rights-of-way, including
providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only,
and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services.
This chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the
City prior to the effective date of this chapter, whether operating with or
without a franchise as set forth herein. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)
14.18.040: EXCLUDED ACTIVITY:
   A.   Exclusions:
      1.   Provisions Applicable To Excluded Providers: Providers excused by
other law that prohibits the City from requiring a franchise shall not be
required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this
chapter through the exercise of the City's police power and not preempted by
other law shall be applicable.
      2.   Interconnection Of Facilities Owned By Single Business: The
requirement of obtaining a telecommunications franchise shall not apply to a
business that only desires to cross or use City rights-of-way to interconnect
its own facilities, wholly located within City limits, if the City Manager
finds:
         a.   That the business will use City rights-of-way only to
interconnect its own facilities; and
         b.   The entity agrees to enter into a written license agreement with
the City wherein the entity agrees to:
            (1)   Assume all costs (including City oversight and inspection
costs) associated with construction and maintenance of the facilities,
including all costs associated with the complete restoration of the City right-
of-way after construction (or removal) of the facilities in the City right-of-
way;
            (2)   Assume all liability arising from the construction,
installation, maintenance, repair, use, operation, and/or removal of the
facilities and indemnify, defend and hold City harmless from any such
liability; and
            (3)   Pay a reasonable license fee for use of right-of-way based on
comparable revenues received by the City from its franchisees.
      3.   City Facilities Or Poles: Nothing herein shall give the entity the
right to use City facilities or poles, the use of which shall be governed by
the license agreement. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)
14.18.050: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The City is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and
maintenance of systems in the City's rights-of- way, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the City and provider.
   B.   Every Provider Must Obtain A Franchise: Except to the extent preempted
by Federal or State law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent
jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise
prior to constructing a utility system or providing utility services using the
rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing
an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system.
Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and
consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the
extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a
court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that
particular utility systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate
the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and
not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable
franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over
the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the City's property. This section shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by Federal or State
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of this
chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the City within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of this chapter. If such request is made, the
provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a
timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not
granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of section
14.16.010 et seq., of this title and this chapter. If a provider has previously
entered into a telecommunications franchise agreement with City the term of
which has not expired, the provider may continue to operate under the existing
franchise agreement until the term of the franchise agreement expires or may
negotiate a new franchise agreement with City.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the City under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights-of- way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City upon the written request of the City
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)
14.18.060: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation And Payments:
      1.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
         a.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City to
review an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees,
permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of
application, a non-refundable application fee as shown on the consolidated fee
schedule adopted by the City Council.
         b.   Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in
the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence
on the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee
or Business License Tax enacted by the City.
         c.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for
an excavation permit as provided in section
14.16.010 et seq., of this title.
      2.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all

provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement
showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to
its accuracy.
      4.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties,
at the direction of the City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties
(including but not limited to attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise, provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, the parties may submit the issue to arbitration in
accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration
Association.
      5.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
      6.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the City on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent State Taxes.
      7.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the City of any fee
shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct
amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release
of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
      8.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment
in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in
this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the City owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
      9.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider
continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the
franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable
provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation,
all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period of such
continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way
be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution.
      10.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-

14.18.080: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Requirements:
      1.   General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing

ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights-of-way.
      2.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,
it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by State or
Federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system,
including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or
within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions.

City may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as
determined by the City in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of
the system and appurtenances on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City,

person other than the City for any such movement of its systems.
         d.   Rights-Of-Way Change - Obligation To Move System: When the City
is changing a rights-of-way and makes a written request, a provider is required
to move or remove its system from the rights-of-way, without cost to the City,
to the extent provided in the excavation ordinance. This obligation does not
apply to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights-of-way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
      5.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction,
maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its
own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the

designated landmark district. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent
of the City to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage
system, or any other Municipal structure on, over or under the rights-of-way of
the City required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration
shall be made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider
agrees that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the City to replace or
repair and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably
specified by the City, any Municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of
the City involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal
of the system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work
thereon by or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
      6.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably
obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guide way systems, railways, passenger
travel, or other traffic to, from or within the City without the prior consent
of the appropriate authorities.

other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements including but not
limited to the National Electric Safety Code.
      8.   Repair By City: After written reasonable notice to the provider,
unless, in the sole determination of the City, an eminent danger exists, any
rights-of-way within the City which are disturbed or damaged during the
construction, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be
repaired by the City at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that
prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall submit

local laws or regulations.

authorized representative of the City of the system and its effect on the
rights-of-way.

trees, in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and
easement restrictions, upon and hanging over rights-of-way so as to prevent the
branches of such trees from coming in contact with its system.
      11.   Location To Minimize Interference: All lines, poles, towers, pipes,
conduits, equipment, property, structures, and assets of the provider shall be
located so as to cause minimum interference with the use of streets, alleys,
rights-of-way, and public property by others and shall cause minimum
interference with the rights of owners of property that abuts any of said
streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or public property.
      12.   Repair Of Damage By Provider: If during the course of work on its
facilities, the provider causes damage to or alters any street, alley, right-
of-way, sidewalk, utility, public improvement, or other public or private
property, the provider (at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by
the City) shall promptly and completely replace and restore such street, alley,
right-of-way, sidewalk, utility, public improvement or other public or private
property in accordance with applicable City ordinances, policies, and
regulations relating to repair work of similar character to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City. Except in case of emergency, the provider, prior to
commencing work in the public way, street, or public property, shall make
application for a permit to perform such work from the City Engineer or other
department or division designated by the City. Such permit shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The provider shall abide by all reasonable regulations
and requirements of the City for such work.
      13.   Restoring Landscaping: In constructing and installing its system,
the provider shall restore landscaping and the general appearance of any
property located within the City in a manner consistent with the surrounding
properties. Such obligation to repair and restore the appearance of property
shall include, but not be limited to, the landscaping of front yards and
parkways in residential zones; the reinstallation of curb, gutter, sidewalk,
and parkway landscaping in those areas where similar improvements have been or
are being installed on contiguous properties; and the screening of provider's
facilities directly abutting a public street or abutting residential property
with appropriate landscaping or screening material as required by the City's
Planning Commission.
      14.   Guarantee Of Repairs: For a period of one year following the
completion of the repair work performed pursuant to subsection A12 of this
section, the company shall maintain, repair, and keep in good condition those
portions of said streets, alleys, rights- of-way, or public property restored,
repaired, or replaced to the satisfaction of the City. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)

14.18.070 of this chapter.
         c.   If PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists,
or if its regulations or State law no longer require approval of transactions
described in subsection A1 of this section, and the City has good cause to
believe that the successor entity may not comply with this chapter or the
franchise agreement, it may require an application. The application shall
comply with section
14.18.070 of this chapter.
      2.   Events Of Sale: The following events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring compliance with
subsection A1 of this section:

franchise.
      2.   Oversight: The City shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance, and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the City at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
      3.   Maintain Records: A provider shall at all times maintain:
         a.   On file with the City, a full and complete set of plans, records

         b.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership,
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the City at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that

City at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records, provided that the City shall not audit
the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the City the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the City for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the City by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the City may accept
any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the City
shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is
later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)

         b.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The City, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights-of-way to their former state at the time such system was

condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,

transfer, the City shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all above ground portions of a system from the rights-of-way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If for a telecommunications system, the provider is the incumbent
local exchange carrier, it shall not be required to remove its system, but
shall negotiate a renewal in good faith.
         e.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground
system in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the
rights-of-way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or
other person. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-4-2018)

any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all
appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the chapter provisions in
question are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate,
distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the
event that such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise
changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law the provision in question shall return to full
force and effect and shall again be binding on the City and the provider,
provided that the City shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer
period of time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such
a rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring
compliance with such provision.
   C.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the City to liberally amend
this chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the

14.48.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a consistent standard regarding
compensation to the city for the vacation and/or transfer of its interest in
public streets. Vacation of the city's interest in streets should be viewed as
a transfer of a substantial property right for which the public should be
compensated. To prevent windfall enrichment to abutting property owners at
public expense, such transfer should not be made without compensation being
paid to the city. (1999 Code)
14.48.020: STREET DEFINED:
"Street" means all major and minor streets, alleys, walkways and trails. (1999
Code)
14.48.030: CONDITIONS FOR VACATION:
Petitions for vacation of public streets shall be considered on the basis of
the following:
   A.   Alleys, Walkways And Trails: Alleys, walkways and trails are not
generally within the current planning and maintenance policies of the city.
Vacation of an alley, walkway or trail relieves the city from present and
future obligations to maintain such alley, walkway or trail. This benefit to
the city is declared to be adequate compensation for the city's interest. Where
appropriate, the city may require conditions precedent to the vacation of any
alley, walkway or trail such as installation of landscaping, fencing or other
improvements which must be completed or bonded for prior to the enactment of
the vacation ordinance.
   B.   Major And Minor Streets: Major and minor streets shall not be vacated
or permanently closed unless adequate compensation has been paid for the
transfer of the city's interest in the land. (1999 Code)
14.48.040: FEES AND ADVERTISING COSTS:
No petition for vacation of a city street shall be considered unless
accompanied by the fee required by title 3,
chapter 3.35 of this code. (Ord. 2010-27, 12-9-2010)
14.48.050: LEGAL INTEREST OF CITY:
No action shall be taken on any petition to vacate a street until the
department identifies and verifies the specific manner in which the city
acquired its interest in the street and the city attorney determines the legal
interest of the city in the street. (1999 Code)
14.48.060: EVALUATION OF NEED FOR STREET:
Each petition shall be evaluated in terms of the current use of the street and
the need in the foreseeable future for its use as a public street or for any
other public purpose. If such need exists or may exist in the foreseeable
future, the petition shall be denied. (1999 Code)
14.48.070: COMPENSATION:
Any action providing vacation, sale or other transfer of the city's interest in
any street where compensation is required shall be conditioned upon prior
payment of such compensation and shall not be completed by an enactment of the
ordinance until all required compensation is paid to the city, together with
advertising costs for all public notices. Generally, such compensation shall be
the fair market value of the land. In appropriate cases compensation may be
provided for, in part or in whole, through an exchange of land or relocation of
streets within an existing subdivision. Where the city's interest in a street
is transferred to another public entity for a public use which benefits the
city, the mayor may determine that the benefit to the city from such use is
adequate compensation for the land. Where appropriate, the city may require
conditions precedent such as the installation of landscaping, fencing or other
improvements which must be completed or bonded for prior to the enactment of a
vacation ordinance. (1999 Code)

of occupants where such can be done without sacrificing the public health,
safety and welfare;
      5.   Providing for the administration, enforcement and penalties for this
chapter.

applicable laws in effect at the time of their construction or whose fire
resistive integrity and fire extinguishing systems have been adequately

with the standards in effect at that time. This chapter shall not lessen such
requirements for residential buildings which were constructed in compliance
with the code in effect at the time of construction.

CHAPTER 17.20
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
SECTION:
17.20.010: Generally
17.20.020: Stormwater Management Plan Study Requirements
17.20.030: Design Standards
17.20.010:  GENERALLY:
   The provisions of this chapter apply where the owner or developer is
required to control excess waters within a development site. A Stormwater
Management Plan is required for all developments or redevelopment equal to or
greater than 1.0 acres.
   Developments or redevelopments less than 1.0 acres are required to submit
the simplified impervious calculations as required in the building permit
application and are required to retain excess water on-site when the impervious
surface is increased equal to or greater than 10%. All developments and
redevelopments subject to review under Chapter
13.08 (as they apply to multi-family, commercial, retail, and mixed-use) are
subject to meeting the onsite stormwater management requirements for the 100-yr
storm event. Design criteria within this chapter shall apply to all on-site
retention systems regardless of the acreage of the development or
redevelopments.
(Ord. 2020-05, 4-16-2020; amd. Ord. 2022-10, 6-2-2022)
17.20.020:  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN STUDY REQUIREMENTS:
   At a minimum, the Stormwater Management Plan shall include the following:
   A.   Exhibits or plans showing basins for the existing and proposed
conditions showing:
      1.   Topographic base map;
      2.   Basin areas and drainage patterns;
      3.   Existing watercourses;
      4.   Drainage systems and facilities;
      5.   Wetlands and environmentally sensitive areas;
      6.   Irrigation systems and facilities
      7.   Basin peak flowrates;
      8.   Property lines;
      9.   Any FEMA floodplains and flood elevations;
      10.   Roads;
      11.   Easements;
      12.   Natural hazard areas as identified on city maps; and
      13.   All other existing significant natural and artificial features.
   B.   Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre-development
and post-development conditions for the design storms. These calculations must
show that the proposed stormwater management measures are capable of
controlling runoff from the site in compliance with this title. Such
calculations shall include, but are not limited to:
      1.   A description of the design storm frequency, duration, and intensity
where applicable;
      2.   Time of concentration;
      3.   Soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients;
      4.   Peak runoff rates for each watershed area;
      5.   Velocity of peak flowrates;
      6.   Infiltration rates, where applicable;
      7.   Culvert, storm drain, ditch and/or other stormwater conveyance
capacities;
      8.   Facility sizing calculations; and
      9.   Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test
results.
   C.   Stormwater quality treatment.
17.20.030:  DESIGN STANDARDS:
   Design standards for controlling excess waters within the development site
are:
   A.   Runoff Analysis: Storm drainage designs are to be prepared using the
Rational Method or Hydrograph Method.
      1.   The Rational Method may only be used for design of systems with
contributing areas less than 20 acres.
      2.   Drainage designs using the Hydrograph Method require computer models
capable of modeling the hydrologic characteristics of the watershed, a series
of storms, and routing the hydrographs through the drainage pipe network,
channels and storage facilities.
   B.   Rainfall Data:
      1.   Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are to be
obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center.
      2.   Historical Daily Rainfall data is to be obtained from the Salt Lake
Airport rainfall gauge.
   C.   Design Storms:
      1.   Redevelopment with an increase in imperviousness equal to or greater
than 10%, must manage rainfall onsite for the increased area of imperviousness
and prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from all rainfall
events less than or equal to the 24-hour 85th percentile rainfall event, being
equal to a depth of 0.52 inches.
      2.   New development of vacant land must manage rainfall on-site and
prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from all rainfall events
less than or equal to the 24-hour 85th percentile rainfall event, being equal
to a depth of 0.52 inches.
      3.   The maximum discharge may not exceed 0.2 cfs for the 100-yr 6-hr
storm event, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer.
   D.   Rainfall Intensity:
      1.   The value of the design rainfall intensity (I) for the Rational
Formula is selected from the appropriate Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF)
curve, with a duration chosen to coincide with the time of concentration. The
time of concentration is the time required for stormwater runoff to become
established and reach the design location from the furthest point within the
contributing basin.
      2.   The time of concentration is the sum of two components, the "inlet
time" and the "travel time". The inlet time is the overland flow time for
stormwater runoff to enter the storm drain system. In developed urban areas
where paved surfaces drain directly to catchbasins, an inlet time of 10 minutes
shall be utilized for assessment of 10-yr storm events. An inlet time of 5
minutes is to be utilized for the 100-yr storm event. Appropriate formulas are
to be used when the surface overland route to a catchbasin is not paved or is
longer than 500-ft.
      3.   The travel time is the length of time required for stormwater to
travel within the storm drain system from the point of inflow to the location
being analyzed.
   E.   Runoff Coefficient:
      1.   C values should be established based on the proposed land uses,
proposed developments and hydrogeological information. Default C values shown
in the following table should be used unless otherwise justified.
Land Use C Value for ≤ 10-yr Storm*
Land Use                   C Value for ≤ 10-yr Storm*
Asphalt or Concrete        0.70 - 0.95
Roofs                      0.70 - 0.95
Lawns:
   sandy soil, flat, 2% 0.05 - 0.10
   sandy soil, avg., 2%-0.10 - 0.15
   sandy soil, steep, > 0.15 - 0.20
   heavy soil, flat, 2% 0.13 - 0.17
   heavy soil, avg., 2%-0.18 - 0.22
   heavy soil, steep, > 0.25 - 0.35
Unimproved                 0.10 - 0.30
 
*Notes:
1.   Lower values are for SCS soil group A; higher values are for SCS soil
group D.
2.   For 100-yr storm events, multiply coefficient by 1.25, not to exceed 1.0.
      2.   In a case of applying the Rational Method to a mixed land use in a
drainage area, a weighted average C value should be used.
   F.   Infiltration Rates:
      1.   Sites with land disturbance area equal to 1.0 acre or more and which
use an infiltration rate that depends on the hydrologic properties of soils
require an onsite infiltration test to determine the infiltration rate. The
infiltration test is to be conducted at the depth where the soils will be
receiving the water (i.e. bottom of the infiltration structure) and at a
distance of not more than 100-ft horizontally between the infiltration test and
the infiltration structure.
      2.   A borehead permeameter - cased (fixed) test method per ASTM 6391 /
USBR 7310 is required to determine the infiltration rate. Other constant head
permeability tests that utilize in-situ conditions and are accompanied by a
recognized published source reference may be approved by the city engineer.
      3.   Safety Factor: A safety factor of 2.0 is to be applied to an
infiltration rate determined by field or lab tests to account for decreased
infiltration rates over time.
      4.   Design Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity rates (Ksat Rate) shown in
the following table are to be used in the absence of a site specific
infiltration test:
Soil Textures K Hydraulic Conductivity Rate (ft/sec)
Soil Textures                     K Hydraulic Conductivity Rate (ft/sec)
Gravel, Sandy gravel, Coarse sand field testing is required

alternate design method for dry wells.
      3.   Infiltration structures are to be located a minimum of 20-ft from a
building foundation or as otherwise recommended by a geotechnical engineer.
      4.   Surface ponding retention/infiltration systems are not permitted on
lots or parcels less than 0.5 acres in size unless the lot or parcel is part of
a collection of lots or parcels equal to or greater than 0.5 acres and is
limited to one residential dwelling structure. Measurements for parcel or lot
size calculations excludes any hard surface area used for a roadway or lane.
      5.   The bottom of an infiltration structure is to be greater than 2.0
feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
      6.   Void space ratio in drain rock used for storage calculations is not

infiltration system, storm drain, canal or creek. Surface areas to be measured
from edge of pavement or an equivalent edge. The stormwater quality treatment
system must be designed to:
         a.   Treat all flows up to 50% of the 2 year (3-hour duration) post-
development flowrate; and
         b.   Reduce the average annual Total Suspended Solids loadings by a
minimum of 80%.
      2.   Facilities that contain fueling areas and chemical and hazardous
storage areas require containment systems designed by a professional engineer.
      3.   For sites with a disturbance area of 1.0 acres or more, a Stormwater
Quality Plan is required with the following minimum requirements:

exceptions:
         a.   A drainage easement is recorded on the property receiving the
stormwater discharge for the purpose of conveying the stormwater on the
receiving property.
         b.   The stormwater discharge maintains a historical drainage pattern
and the discharge does not raise the water surface elevation on the receiving
property.
      7.   Lots shall be graded to drain surface water away from the foundation
walls. The grade shall fall not fewer than 6 inches within the first 10 feet.
Where lot lines, walls, slopes or other physical barriers prohibit 6 inches of

away from the structure. Impervious surfaces within 10 feet of the building
foundation shall be sloped not less than 2 percent away from the building.
      8.   Driveways sloping from a perimeter street toward a structure must be
graded such that any stormwater runoff will be safely routed around the

point of discharge.
   N.   Dry Well:
      1.   Where dry wells are used as means for infiltration, dry well wall
surface area (interface with receiving soils) shall be sized using Darcy's
empirical law:
         Q = A K i
         Where:    Q =   rate of flow (cfs)
            A =   cross section area of soil through which flow takes place
(consider wall area interfacing with receiving soils)
            K =   coefficient of permeability (see section
17.20.030 .F)
            I =   gradient of headloss over a given flow distance (assume 1.0

17.27.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and equitable means of funding
the storm water facilities which will be necessary to service anticipated
future growth and development in the city. The impact fees for storm water
facilities implemented through this chapter will help achieve an equitable
allocation of the costs of providing such facilities which are reasonably
related to and necessary to service anticipated future growth. (1999 Code)
17.27.020: IMPACT FEES IMPOSED:
The owner or developer of property located in one of the drainage basins for
which storm water facilities improvements are necessary in order to accommodate
new development shall pay an impact fee to the city for that purpose. The
amount of the fees shall be as set in this section. The city council may adjust
the fee for inflation by resolution on an annual basis for each fiscal year
based on a report from the department utilizing the construction cost index
published by the engineering news record. The fee shall be paid as a condition
precedent to the issuance of a building permit or construction of improvements
upon the property in question. Where the development is a subdivision of a
conditional use, the fee shall be paid to and collected by the department prior
to the approval of the plat or plan by the department.

Where a private drainage system is installed on private property, the property
owner is required to permanently maintain the facility to ensure it functions
as per its intended purpose. Where a public drainage system is installed on
private property, the property owner is required to provide a maintenance
easement and protect the drainage facility. (Ord. 2020-05, 4-16-2020)
17.29.020:  MAINTENANCE EASEMENTS:
   A.   Easement: The owner/developer must ensure permanent or perpetual access
to the site for the purpose of inspection, maintenance and repair of new and
existing drainage systems by securing all the maintenance easements needed.
These easements must be binding on the current property owner and all
subsequent owners of the property and must be properly recorded in the land
record.
   B.   Minimum Width: Minimum easement widths for a public drainage system
will be determined by the city engineer and shall be based on common
maintenance practices. In no case shall the width of an easement for the
purpose of maintaining subsurface drainage systems be less than 15 feet.

17.30.010: TITLE, APPLICABILITY AND AUTHORITY:
   A.   Title: This chapter shall be known as the GROUNDWATER SOURCE PROTECTION
ORDINANCE.
   B.   Applicability: This chapter shall be effective within the corporate
boundaries of the city with respect to both city owned and noncity owned
groundwater sources, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, outside the
corporate boundaries of the city with respect to city owned groundwater
sources. This chapter establishes certain standards and restrictions intended
to prevent contamination of the public drinking water supply as a result of
toxic substances entering the groundwater. It shall be the responsibility of
any person owning real property and/or owning or operating a business within
the protective zones or recharge areas established pursuant to this chapter.
Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this chapter apply only to new
development or a change in property use; a change or expansion of an existing
legal nonconforming use; and the handling, movement, and storage of hazardous
waste, petroleum products and regulated substances, which occur or commence
after the effective date hereof.
   C.   Authority: This is adopted pursuant to the authority provided in the
Utah municipal land use development and management act section 10-8-15, Utah
code, R309-113 of the Utah administrative code, and other applicable statutory
and common law of the state of Utah. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)
17.30.020: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, preserve, and maintain
existing and potential public drinking water sources in order to safeguard the
public health, safety and welfare of customers and other users of the city's
public drinking water supply, distribution and delivery system. The intent of
this chapter is to establish and designate drinking water source protection
zones and groundwater recharge areas for all underground sources of public
drinking water which enter the public's culinary drinking water supply,
distribution and delivery system, whether such sources are located within, or
outside of, the city's corporate boundaries. This chapter establishes criteria
for regulating the storage, handling, use or production of hazardous waste,
petroleum products and regulated substances within identified areas where
groundwater is, or could be affected by the potential contaminant source. This
shall be accomplished by the designation and regulation of property uses and
conditions that may be maintained within such zones or areas. (Ord. 06-07, 4-
20-2006)
   B.   This chapter shall not be construed to allow a permitted or a
conditional use except as that use may be provided in the land use ordinance of
this code. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate and/or prohibit
certain land uses which may be otherwise classified as permitted or conditional
uses under the land use ordinance, and if the provisions of this chapter
conflict with the land use ordinance in this regard, the more strict provisions
of this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006; amd. Ord. 2012-15, 9-20-
2012)
   C.   The degree of protection afforded by this chapter is considered
adequate for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not ensure that public
drinking water sources will not be subject to accidental or intentional
contamination, nor does it create liability on the part of the city, or an
officer or employee thereof, for any damages to the public water supplies from
reliance on this chapter nor any administrative order lawfully made hereunder.
   D.   Compliance with the terms of this chapter shall not relieve the person
subject to the terms hereof of the obligation to comply with any other
applicable federal, state, regional or local regulation, rule, ordinance or
requirement. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)

capricious or illegal. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)
17.30.100: MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
   A.   Toxic, Hazardous And Other Materials Handling Regulations:
      1.   Storage Containers: All regulated substances, hazardous waste, and
petroleum products shall be stored in suitable containers to reduce the chance
for accidental introduction into the environment. These storage containers
shall be product tight and, except where provided elsewhere in this chapter,
shall be provided with a means to control spillage and to contain or drain off
spillage and fire protection water discharged in the storage area. Storage
containers and secondary containment areas must be covered and/or elevated to
prevent the accumulation of rain or other water. Defective storage containers
shall be removed from service for repair or disposal in accordance with local,
state, and federal standards.
      2.   Secondary Containment: Secondary containment shall be constructed of
a material of sufficient structural integrity and composition to contain the
required capacity of liquids and not be structurally weakened as a result of
contact with the discharge of the regulated substance, hazardous waste or
petroleum product to be contained. The material shall be free of cracks,
joints, gaps, or other imperfections which would allow leakage through the
containment material.
The secondary containment system shall have sufficient capacity to contain: a)
ten percent (10%) of the volume of all containers and one hundred percent
(100%) of the volume of the largest single container, whichever is greater,
plus b) the design flow rate of the automatic fire extinguishing system (for 20
minutes) for the area or room in which the storage is located. If the storage
area and/or containment area are open to rainfall, the secondary containment
system must also accommodate the volume of a twenty four (24) hour rainfall as
determined by a 25-year storm frequency. Liquid that accumulates in the
secondary containment system shall be removed in as timely a manner as
necessary to prevent overflow of the system. Nonhazardous liquids may be
drained in accordance with applicable local regulations. If the collected
material is a hazardous waste under title 40, part 261 of the code of federal
regulations, it must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all
applicable requirements of parts 262 through 266 of that regulation.
Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials or other devices approved
by the department, shall be present on site or available to facilitate the
removal or further containment of a spill. Devices or materials shall be
available in sufficient magnitude so as to at least control and collect the
total quantity of regulated substances, hazardous waste and petroleum products
that the containment system is designed to contain. Emergency containers shall
be present and of such capacity as to hold the total quantity of regulated
substances plus absorbent material.
      3.   Emergency Management Plan: An emergency plan shall be prepared and
filed with the health department, the city of Holladay fire and police
departments and the community development department indicating the procedures
that will be followed in the event of the release of a regulated substance,
hazardous waste or petroleum product so as to control and collect all such
spilled material in such a manner as to prevent it from discharging into any
storm or sanitary drains or the ground. A facility or property which has had,
or appears to have had, unauthorized discharges to soil or ground water shall
submit a regulated substances management plan for the facility if required by
the department. The written plan will be used to demonstrate to the department
that the facility owner or operator understands the procedures and has the
proper equipment to handle regulated substances, hazardous waste and petroleum
products within the guidelines of this chapter. The plan may not be implemented
without the approval of the department.
      4.   Reporting Of Spills: Any spill of a regulated substance in excess of
the nonaggregate quantity thresholds established by the list of hazardous waste
(40 CFR part 261, subpart D), and 40 CFR appendix VII-hazardous constituents
and EPA designation reportable quantities and notification requirements for
hazardous substances under CERCLA (40 CFR 302, effective July 3, 1986), shall
be reported by telephone to the city and designated water utility within one
hour of discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall commence immediately upon
discovery of the spill. A full written report shall be submitted to the public
services department and the health department within fifteen (15) days of
discovery of the spill.
   B.   Best Management Practices: Under the provisions of this chapter, all
persons having control or ownership of potential contamination sources within
the city's boundaries shall incorporate and utilize best management practices
(BMPs) in their operations. BMPs that reduce the potential for spills and leaks
at a site to occur and enter ground water shall be construed within the context
of this chapter to include, but not be limited to, structural and nonstructural
practices, conservation practices, and operation and maintenance procedures as
specified by the Utah department of environmental quality and the U.S.
environmental protection agency. BMPs outlined in appendix B in section
17.30.150 of this chapter supplement those provided in this subsection. It is
the responsibility of the applicant to comply with the most recent, updated
version of BMP provisions.
      1.   Underground Storage Tanks: Installation of any new underground
storage tanks (USTs) used to store regulated substances, hazardous waste or
petroleum products for either residential or nonresidential activities in
recharge areas and protection zones designated pursuant to this chapter, shall
require a secondary containment system for the tank and associated underground
piping, and an automatic leak detection system. A permit from the Utah state
division of environmental remediation and response shall be required for the
removal or closure of USTs. The permit shall require that leaking tanks be
pumped dry and removed from the ground by a state licensed company. If removal
of the UST(s) is not feasible, the lines shall be disconnected and capped and
the tank shall be filled with an inert substance such as washed sand. Best
management practices implementation is required for all USTs.
      2.   Septic Tank Systems: No person may place, maintain or operate on
site sewage disposal from a septic tank within the primary recharge area, zone
1, zone 2, or within three hundred feet (300') of any public street in which a
public sewer is laid. Septic systems in zones 3 and 4 shall comply with the
Utah state department of health "care of waste disposal regulations", part IV
and part V. Nonresidential activities which have septic tank systems shall have
installed a four inch (4") diameter vertical pipe and shall be located in a
manner which will permit ready access by department personnel to extract
representative samples to check for improper or unauthorized disposal of
regulated substances, hazardous waste or petroleum products. A septic holding
tank that does not discharge into the soil is preferred. The contents of a
septic holding tank are removed, and can be treated or disposed of at an
appropriate facility. No new septic tank may be installed within the corporate
limits of the city after May 1, 2006. All septic tanks located within three
hundred feet (300') of a public sewer must connect to the public sewer by July
1, 2008.
      3.   Sewage Collection, Transmission And Disposal: No person may
discharge treated or untreated sewage in any area not specifically designated
for that purpose by the department. The owner or operators of any wastewater
treatment plant, sanitary sewer, force main, gravity sewer, or lateral shall
notify the department within twenty four (24) hours of discovering a break that
may or does result in the leakage of sewage. Emergency telephone numbers will
be prominently displayed on all sewage lift stations within zones 1, 2, 3, 4,
and the primary recharging area. All leaking sewage collection and transmission
pipes shall be promptly repaired or replaced. New sewage collection and
transmission pipes shall be installed according to acceptable construction
standards, as determined by the Utah department of environmental quality and
the city, and shall have routine inspections during and after construction. The
placement or operation of a wastewater treatment plant within zone 1 or 2 is
strictly forbidden.
      4.   General Stormwater Management: All stormwater management systems to
be constructed and implemented for facilities within the protection zones and
recharge areas shall obtain permits in accordance with applicable local, state,
and federal laws and regulations.
      5.   Deicing Salt Storage And Application: Deicing salt shall be stored
on an impermeable pad and shall be covered. Deicing salt application shall use
best management practices and shall evaluate substitute products and
technologies.
      6.   Landfills: Expansion or creation of new landfills is prohibited in
the primary recharge area and zone 1 and zone 2. Existing landfills in the
primary recharge area or in protection zone 1 shall be required to comply with
the provisions of Utah administrative code R315-301-1 through 301-5. Landfills
shall develop and implement a landfill monitoring program. The monitoring shall
include the vadose zone and groundwater. If the monitoring detects
contamination, the following corrective measures may be required:
         a.   Landfill: Cover the landfill with suitable low permeability
materials and minimize the application of supplemental water to reduce
infiltration of moisture.
         b.   Groundwater Containment: Install groundwater containment and
treatment actions, additional monitoring and erosion controls as required.
(Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)
         c.   Environmental Quality Monitoring: Facilities which have had, or
appear to have had, unauthorized releases to soil or groundwater shall be
required by the department to monitor soil and groundwater in and adjacent to
the facility. At the request of the department, the facility shall submit a
monitoring plan for department review. The plan shall be implemented with the
approval of the department. Facilities that undergo closure may be required to
monitor soil and groundwater in and abutting the facility subject to closure.
All costs associated with the closing and monitoring of the site will be paid
for by the operator of the facility. (Ord. 2015-02, 2-5-2015)
17.30.110: EXCLUSIONS AND EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   Qualifying Statement: The exclusions and exemptions contained in this
section shall not apply to protection zone 1, i.e., sites within a one hundred
foot (100') radius from a well.
   B.   Exclusions And Exemptions: The following substances are not subject to
the provisions of this chapter, provided that these substances are handled,
stored and disposed of in a manner that does not result in an unauthorized
release or cause contamination of the groundwater:
      1.   Regulated substances stored at residences that do not exceed ten
(10) pounds (dry) or five (5) gallons (liquid) (except as allowed in subsection
B3 of this section) and used for personal, family or household purposes;

of in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. (Ord.
06-07, 4-20-2006)
17.30.120: ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION AND PENALTIES; CIVIL:
   A.   Notification Of Violation: If the director finds that any regulated
person has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter, or any
order, rule or regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, the director may
serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Such written notice shall
be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within five
(5) days after the receipt of such notice, an explanation for the violation and
a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, which shall
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the regulated person
to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the regulated
person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   B.   Consent Orders: The director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any regulated person responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
regulated person. Consent orders shall be judicially enforceable.
   C.   Order To Show Cause Hearing: The director may order any regulated
person which causes or contributes to violation(s) of any provisions of this
chapter, or any order, rule or regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, to
appear before the director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the regulated person, which
notice shall specify the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the
regulated person show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Such written notice shall be served in person on any authorized
representative of the regulated person, or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Whether or not the
regulated person appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a
prerequisite for taking any other actions against the regulated person.
   D.   Compliance Orders: If the director finds that a regulated person has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, the director may issue an order to
the regulated person responsible for the violation directing that the regulated
person come into compliance within thirty (30) days. If the regulated person
does not come into compliance within thirty (30) days, any and all available
remedies may be pursued, including, if necessary to prevent an actual or
imminent discharge which may contaminate the ground water, discontinuing water
and/or water service to the regulated person as provided in subsection F of
this section. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address
noncompliance, including additional self- monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants released. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the regulated person of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the regulated person.
   E.   Cease And Desist Orders: If the director finds that a regulated person
is violating any provision of this chapter, any rule or regulation issued or
promulgated hereunder, or that the regulated person's past violations are
likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the regulated person
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
regulated person to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation. Issuance of a cease
and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the regulated person.
   F.   Emergency Suspension Of Utility Service: The director may order the
immediate shutoff of affected utilities and suspension of a regulated person's
actions (after informal notice to the regulated person), whenever such
suspension or shutoff is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause a risk of an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the ground water or the health or welfare of the
city's culinary water customers. Any regulated person notified of a suspension
of its activities shall immediately stop conducting such activities. If a
regulated person fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary to enforce such
order. The director shall allow the regulated person to recommence operations
when the regulated person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director
that the period of endangerment has passed. A regulated person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment, shall submit to the director a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, prior to the date of any show cause hearing
under this section, if applicable. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   G.   Injunctive Relief: If a regulated person has violated or continues to
violate a provision of this chapter or continues to violate any order, rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, the city may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction,
as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
ordinance provision, order, rule, regulation or other requirement. In addition,
the city may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses
of litigation by appropriate legal action against the regulated person found to
have violated any provision hereof, or of any order, or any other rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder. Such other action as appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the city. A petition
for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other
action against a regulated person.
   H.   Civil Fine Pass Through Recovery: If a regulated person releases such
pollutants which cause the city to violate any applicable laws, rules or
regulations to which the city is subject, and the city is fined or held liable
regarding such violations, the regulated person shall be fully liable for the
total amount of the fines and civil penalties assessed against the city and any
administrative costs incurred. The city may commence a civil proceeding to
collect amounts due the city under this subsection.
   I.   Public Nuisances: A violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of
any order, rule or regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
director. A person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of applicable laws governing nuisances, including reimbursement to
the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying the nuisance.
   J.   Enforcement By Other Agencies: The city may request the health
department, and the health department is hereby granted the authority upon such
request, to enforce or administer the provisions of this chapter and to
prosecute any violations thereof. To the extent of any such request, references
in this chapter to the department and the city shall be deemed to mean the
health department, and references in this chapter to the director shall be
deemed to mean the director of the health department. In addition, the city may
refer to the state of Utah or the federal government, for civil or criminal
prosecution, any violations of this chapter which also violate applicable
provisions of state or federal law, orders, administrative rules or permits. It
is the intent of the city that this chapter shall be construed to the greatest
extent possible to be consistent with the provisions of applicable county,
state and federal laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and permits. In the
event of a conflict, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
   K.   Nonexclusive Remedies: The provisions of subsections A through J of
this section are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take
any, all, or any combination of these actions against a regulated person as
circumstances warrant. The city is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against a regulated person for each separate violation of this chapter,
which actions may be taken concurrently. Each day a violation of this chapter
continues is deemed to be a separate violation. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)
17.30.130: INSPECTION AUTHORITY:
When necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this
chapter, or when the director has reasonable cause to believe that there exists
upon any property or on or in any facility located thereon any condition which
violates this chapter, the director is authorized to enter such property or
facility during normal business hours in the case of a business or commercial
use, or in the case of a residential property or facility, during daylight
hours, to inspect the same or to perform any duty authorized by this chapter;
provided that if such property or facility is occupied, the director shall
first present credentials and demand entry; and if such property or facility is
unoccupied, the director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other persons having charge or control of the property or facilities
and demand entry. If entry is denied, the director shall have recourse to every
remedy provided by law to obtain entry.
If the owner or occupant denies entry, the director is authorized to obtain an
administrative search warrant or other warrant provided by law to obtain entry.
Owners, occupants or any other persons having the charge, care or control of
property or facilities shall, after proper request is made as provided herein,
promptly admit the director for the purpose of inspection pursuant to this
chapter. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)
17.30.140: CRIMINAL PENALTY:
A regulated person who fails to do an act required by this chapter or who
commits an act which is prohibited by this chapter is guilty of a class B
misdemeanor. Each day a violation is committed or permitted to continue
constitutes a separate violation. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006)

   B.   Appendix B; List Of Potential Contamination Sources And Best Management
Practices: The following table identifies uses which have varying potentials to
contaminate groundwater sources. These uses have been classified according to
the risk of contamination in each protection zone as follows: (Ord. 06-07, 4-
20-2006)
      Permitted Uses (P): The risk of contamination is considered relatively
low in the specified zone if regulatory requirements and best management
practices are implemented and, therefore, the use is permitted if it otherwise
conforms to the land use ordinance, title 13 of this code.
      Restricted Uses (R): The risk of contamination is moderate in the
specified zone. The Utah division of drinking water quality shall first review
all conditional use requests. The use may then be permitted only after
conditional use review and approval by the planning commission if the use
otherwise conforms to the land use ordinance, title 13 of this code. Approval
is subject to implementation of best management practices and compliance with
other reasonable conditions as may be established by the planning commission.
      Prohibited Uses (X): The risk of contamination is very high in the
specified zone. The use is not permitted regardless of any other provision of
the land use ordinance, title 13 of this code. (Ord. 06-07, 4-20-2006; amd.

TITLE 18
ANTIDISCRIMINATION
CHAPTER 18.01
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION:
18.01.010: Purpose
18.01.020: Administration
18.01.030: Antidiscrimination Board
18.01.040: No Private Right Of Action; No Special Rights
18.01.050: Severability
18.01.060: Definitions
18.01.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   Every individual in the city has the right to work and earn wages
through gainful employment. Discriminatory employment practices are detrimental
because they impede the social and economic progress of the city by preventing
all of the city's citizens from contributing to or fully participating in the
cultural, spiritual, social and commercial life of the community, which is
essential to the growth and vitality of the city's neighborhoods and
businesses. The Utah antidiscrimination act, Utah code section 34A-5-101 et
seq., addresses employment related discrimination based on race, color, sex,
pregnancy, childbirth or pregnancy related conditions, religion, national
origin, age (if 40 years of age or older), and disability, but does not address
discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
   B.   Every individual in the city has the right to seek housing.
Discriminatory housing practices are detrimental because they impede the social
and economic progress of the city by preventing all of the city's citizens from
contributing to or fully participating in the cultural, spiritual, social and
commercial life of the community, which is essential to the growth and vitality
of the city's neighborhoods and businesses.
   C.   The Utah fair housing act, Utah code section 57-21-1 et seq., addresses
housing related discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, familial status, source of income, and disability, but does not address
discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
The city has found that discrimination in employment and housing on the basis
of sexual orientation and gender identity must be addressed. The denial or
deprivation of employment rights and access to housing because of an
individual's sexual orientation or gender identity is detrimental to the
health, safety, and welfare of the city's citizens and damages the city's
economic well being. The purpose of this title is to provide a clear and
comprehensive mandate for the prevention and elimination of discrimination in
employment and housing in the city against individuals based upon sexual
orientation or gender identity and this title shall be liberally construed to
achieve that purpose. (Ord. 2014-04, 2-20-2014)
18.01.020: ADMINISTRATION:
The city manager is responsible for administering and implementing this title.
(Ord. 2014-04, 2-20-2014)
18.01.030: ANTIDISCRIMINATION BOARD:
   A.   The city manager is authorized to establish the antidiscrimination
board and to appoint the three (3) members of the board.
   B.   The term of each board member shall be determined by the city manager.
   C.   Any member of the board may be removed by the city manager at any time.
The city manager shall select the chair of the board.
   D.   The board may adopt rules of policy and procedure for the governing of
meetings, its members, and the performance of its duties. (Ord. 2014-04, 2-20-
2014)
18.01.040: NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION; NO SPECIAL RIGHTS:
This title does not create a private cause of action, nor does it create any
right or remedy that is the same or substantially equivalent to the remedies
provided under federal or state law. This title does not create any special
rights or privileges which would not be available to all of the city's citizens
because every person has a sexual orientation and a gender identity. (Ord.
2014-04, 2-20-2014)
18.01.050: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this
title is for any reason determined to be illegal, invalid, superseded by other
authority or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any
state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such
determination shall have no effect on the validity of any other section,
sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this chapter, all of
which will remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 2014-04, 2-20-2014)
