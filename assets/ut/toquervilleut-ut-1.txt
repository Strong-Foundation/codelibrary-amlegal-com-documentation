10-19B-2: Simple Subdivision
10-19B-3: Conventional Subdivision
10-19B-4: Phased Subdivisions
Â 
10-19B-1: SCOPE:
A. All subdivisions of land shall be divided, subdivided, reconfigured,
developed or redeveloped in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, and
other applicable provisions of this Title, the state land sales practices act,
the City General Plan, and all other applicable City resolutions and ordinances
and Utah Code Annotated.
B. Specific procedures for each type of subdivision are outlined in Articles of
this Chapter as noted in this Article. General subdivision procedures are

additional requirements and/or relaxed requirements as outlined in this
Chapter. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â 
10-19B-2: SIMPLE SUBDIVISION:
The intent of this simple subdivision process is to take advantage of the Utah
State Code exemption to allow for a subdivision with no more than three (3) or
fewer lots to be processed in a shorter time frame as a simple subdivision.
This code outlines a separate process for a simple subdivision with three (3)
or fewer lots. In this process, an applicant may elect to divide property
through a metes and bounds record of survey. See Article E of this Chapter for
the approval process and required improvements. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â 
10-19B-3: CONVENTIONAL SUBDIVISION:
The purpose and intent of the conventional subdivision procedure is to allow
the division of land in all zones in a standard and more traditional
configuration of lots. While creative and innovative land development is
encouraged, the conventional subdivision may be best suited for smaller acreage
subdivisions and/or tract developments. See Article C of this Chapter for
approval process and Article D of this Chapter for required improvements. (Ord.
2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â 
10-19B-4: PHASED SUBDIVISIONS:
Conventional and master planned developments may be phased subdivisions if the
project is proposed to be completed in designated phases. The purpose of the
phased subdivision procedure is to provide general development parameters for
subdivision phases in the phased subdivision master plan prior to the detailed
and comprehensive requirements of the preliminary plat and final plat. The
developer and/or owner shall enter into a development agreement (see section
10-19C-5) that outlines the duties, responsibilities, obligations, commitments
and promises of the City and the owner and developer. See Article C of this
Chapter for the approval process, Article D of this Chapter for required
improvements, and Chapter 21 of this Title, general design standards, for
additional standards and requirements. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)

interpretation.

available by the time of final plat approval, then one of the following
alternatives may be elected, at the discretion of the City Council, to assure
that adequate public services are available at the time of occupancy:
a. Allow the developer to voluntarily construct those public improvements which
are necessary to service development as determined by the City staff by
entering into an appropriate form of development agreement, which shall
include, if applicable, provisions to recoup any expenses incurred above and
beyond those reasonable and necessary for, or related to, the need created by,

1-10A-2: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The city council finds that the enforcement of this code and applicable state
codes throughout the city is an important public service. Code enforcement is
vital to the protection of the public health, safety and quality of life. The
city council recognizes that enforcement starts with the drafting of precise
regulations that can be effectively applied in administrative code enforcement
hearings and judicial proceedings. The city council further finds that a
comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a combination of judicial and
administrative remedies is critical to gain compliance with these regulations.
Failure to comply with an administrative code enforcement action may require
the city attorney to file a judicial action to gain compliance. (Ord. 2014.04,
9-11-2014)
1-10A-3: SCOPE:
The provisions of this chapter may be applied to all violations of this code.

1-10A-4: EXISTING LAW CONTINUED:
The provisions of this chapter do not invalidate any other chapter or ordinance
of this code, but shall be read in conjunction with those chapters and
ordinances as an additional remedy available for enforcement of those
ordinances. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)
1-10A-5: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RIGHT:
The city has sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal
case for the violation of any of its ordinances. The city may choose to file
both, or one or the other. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in
no way interfere with the city's right to prosecute city ordinance violations
as criminal offenses. The city may use any of the remedies available under the
law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the city chooses to file both
civil and criminal charges for the same day of violation, no civil penalties
may be assessed, but all other remedies are available. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-
2014)
1-10A-6: EFFECT OF HEADING:
Title, chapter, article, part and section headings contained in this chapter

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision of
this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. The city council hereby
declares that it would have adopted this chapter and each section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision thereof, irrespective of the
fact that one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases,
portions or provisions be declared invalid or unconstitutional. This section
shall apply to all amendments heretofore or hereafter made to this chapter.
(Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)
1-10A-8: NO MANDATORY DUTY OR CIVIL LIABILITY:
It is the intent of the city council that in establishing performance standards
or establishing an obligation to act by a city officer or employee, these
standards shall not be construed as creating a mandatory duty for purposes of
tort liability if the officer or employee fails to perform his or her directed
duty or duties. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)

petitioning for appeal has paid all required costs. The petitioning party's
failure to properly arrange for copies of the record, or to pay the full costs
for the record, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the petition for
review was filed shall be grounds for dismissal of the petition for judicial
review.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Remand For Supplemental Procedures: If a transcript of a hearing cannot
be prepared because the tape recording is incomplete or unintelligible, the
district court may, in its discretion, remand the matter to the ALJ for a

The city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcement for violations of this code and applicable sections of the Utah
code that are found to exist. The city council further finds that an
appropriate method of enforcement for these types of violations is the issuance
and recordation of notices of violation. The remedies established in this
article shall be in addition to criminal, civil or any other remedy established
by law that may be pursued to address the violation of this code or applicable
state codes. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)
1-10E-2: RECORDATION OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION; NOTICE OF SATISFACTION:
Whenever the ACE administrator determines that a property or violation has not
been brought into compliance as required in this chapter, the ACE administrator
has the authority to record the notice of violation or administrative code
enforcement order with the Washington County recorder's office.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Procedure For Recordation: Recordation of a notice of violation shall
occur according to the following procedures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Once the ACE administrator or any enforcement official has issued a
notice of violation to a responsible person, and the property remains in
violation after the deadline established in the notice of violation, and no
request for an ACE hearing has been filed, the ACE administrator shall record a
notice of violation in the official records on file in the office of the
recorder of Washington County, state of Utah.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If an ACE hearing is held, and an administrative code enforcement
order is issued in the city's favor, the ACE administrator shall record the
administrative code enforcement order in the official records on file in the
office of the recorder of Washington County, state of Utah.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The recordation shall include the name of the property owner, the
parcel number, the legal description of the parcel, and a copy of the notice of
violation or administrative code enforcement order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The recordation does not encumber the property, but merely places
future interested parties on notice of any continuing violation found upon the
property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Service Of Notice Of Recordation: A notice of the recordation shall be
served on the responsible person and the property owner pursuant to any of the
methods of service set forth in section
1-10A-12 of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Waiver Of Hearing: The failure of any person to file a request for an
ACE hearing when served with a notice of violation shall constitute a waiver of
the right to an ACE hearing and shall not affect the validity of the recorded
notice of violation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Inspection; Satisfaction: When the notice of violations and/or
administrative code enforcement orders have been corrected, the responsible
person or property owner may request an inspection of the property from the ACE
administrator and the issuance of a notice of compliance or notice of
satisfaction, as the case may be.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Upon receipt of a request for inspection, the ACE administrator or
an enforcement official shall reinspect the property as soon as practicable to
determine whether the violations listed in the notice of violation or the
administrative code enforcement order have been corrected, and whether all
necessary permits have been issued and final inspections have been performed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The ACE administrator shall serve a notice of satisfaction or notice
of compliance, as the case may be, to the responsible person or property owner
in the manner provided in section
1-10A-12 of this chapter, if the ACE administrator determines that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All violations listed in the recorded notice of violation or
administrative code enforcement order have been corrected;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â All necessary permits have been issued and finalized;

satisfaction, as the case may be, has paid all administrative fees and costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If the ACE administrator denies a request to issue a notice of
compliance or notice of satisfaction, upon request the ACE administrator shall
serve the responsible person with a written explanation setting forth the
reasons for the denial. The written explanation shall be served by any of the
methods of service listed in section
1-10A-12 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Recordation of the notice of compliance and notice of satisfaction
shall have the effect of canceling the recorded notice of violation or
administrative code enforcement order. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)
1-10E-3: PROHIBITION AGAINST ISSUANCE OF MUNICIPAL PERMITS:
The city may withhold business licenses; permits for kennels; or permits for
any alteration, repair, or construction pertaining to any existing or new
structures or signs on the property; or any permits pertaining to the use and
development of the real property or the structure when the ACE administrator or
any enforcement official has served a notice of violation upon the responsible
party. The city may withhold permits until a notice of compliance or a notice
of satisfaction has been issued by the ACE administrator. The city may not
withhold permits that are necessary to obtain a notice of satisfaction or that
are necessary to correct serious health and safety violations. (Ord. 2014.04,

within the number of days prescribed in the notice of violation after service
of the notice of violation, civil penalties shall be owed to the city for each
and every subsequent day of violation. Civil penalties are assessed and owing
immediately for any violation of this code or the applicable sections of the

Utah code and a notice of compliance or notice of satisfaction, as the case may
be, has been issued by the ACE administrator or enforcement official.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Civil, Criminal Penalties: Civil penalties cannot be assessed when a
criminal case has been filed for the same date and violation, because fines
will be assessed with the criminal case. However, all other civil and
administrative remedies are available.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Interest: Interest shall be assessed per the city uniform fee schedule
on all outstanding civil penalties, administrative fees, and/or abatement cost
balances until the case has been paid in full.

code or applicable sections of the Utah code shall be assessed pursuant to the
city uniform fee schedule.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Modification: Upon completion of the notice of violation or
administrative code enforcement order, the ALJ may modify the civil penalties
on a finding of good cause. Civil penalties may be waived or modified by the
administrative law judge if there is a finding of good cause based on the
responsible person's claim of legal nonconforming or conditional use, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The city's verification of the claim; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The responsible person's filing of an application for the
conditional use before expiration of the date to correct and said conditional
use is approved by the city.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Failure To Pay: The failure of any person to pay civil penalties
assessed within the specified time is a violation of this chapter and may
result in the city pursuing any legal remedy to collect the civil penalties as

performed and an itemized account of the total abatement costs shall be
prepared by the ACE administrator. The report shall contain the names and
addresses of the responsible persons of each parcel and the tax parcel number.

assist in the collection of civil penalties, abatement costs and administrative
fees assessed by the administrative code enforcement hearing program or

lien is being recorded for the amount of actual costs of abatement. Payment

city treasurer shall record a code enforcement tax lien against the property in

County, state of Utah. The failure of any person with a financial interest in
the property to actually receive the notice of the lien shall not affect the
validity of the lien or any proceedings taken to collect the outstanding costs
of abatement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notice Of Satisfaction: Once payment in full is received for the
outstanding civil penalties and costs, or the amount is deemed satisfied
pursuant to a subsequent administrative order, the ACE administrator shall
either record a notice of satisfaction, or provide the property owner or
financial institution with the notice of satisfaction of judgment so that it
can record this notice in the official records on file in the office of the
recorder of Washington County, state of Utah. The notice of satisfaction shall
include the same information as provided for in the original code enforcement
tax lien. Such notice of satisfaction shall cancel the code enforcement tax
lien. (Ord. 2014.04, 9-11-2014)

As part of any notice, order or action, the ALJ has the authority to require
responsible persons to post an administrative code enforcement performance bond

7-3-4: RESTORATION STANDARDS:
The restoration of all excavations made within a city street or right of way
shall be performed in compliance with the city standards and specifications for
public improvements and the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Preparation: The pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surface shall be
cut vertically along the lines forming the trench in such a manner as to not
damage the adjoining pavement or hard surfacing. An undercut bevel at the rate
of one inch (1") per foot of thickness will be provided at the proposed
junction between the old and new surfaces. The portion to be removed shall be
broken up in a manner that will not cause damage to the pavement outside the
limits of the trench. However, any pavement damaged by operations outside the
limits of the trench shall be replaced. All waste material resulting from the
excavation shall be removed immediately from the site of the work.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Backfill:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Materials: Materials for backfill will be of select nature. All
broken concrete, peat, decomposed vegetable matter and similar materials
obtained from excavation will be removed from the site prior to beginning of
backfilling. All backfill will be placed in layers not over eight inches (8")
loose measure in thickness. Compaction will be obtained by mechanical rollers,
mechanical tampers or similar means. Material for backfilling will have optimum
moisture to ensure compaction to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed
ground in which the trench was dug. Jetting or internal vibrating methods of
compacting sand fill or similar methods of compacting sand or similar granular
free draining materials will be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Density: The density (dry) of the backfill under pavements,
sidewalks, curbs or other structures will be not less than that existing prior
to excavation. The fill shall be restored and placed in a good condition which
will prevent settling.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Restoration Of Hard Surfaces:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General: All street surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways
or other hard surfaces falling in the line of the excavation which must be
removed in performance of the work shall be restored in kind by the excavator,
unless otherwise directed by the city, in accordance with the specifications
contained herein governing the various types of surfaces involved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Protection Of Paved Surfaces: In order to avoid unnecessary damage
to paved surfaces, track equipment shall use pavement pads when operating on or
crossing paved surfaces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Time: In traffic lanes of paved streets, the excavator shall provide
temporary gravel surfaces or cold mulch in good condition immediately after
backfill has been placed, and shall complete permanent repairs on the street,
sidewalk, curb, gutter, driveway and other surfaces, within five (5) days from
the date of completion of the backfill, except for periods:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â When permanent paving material is not available;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When weather conditions prevent permanent replacement;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â When an extension of time is granted by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Temporary Repair: If temporary repair has been made on the paved
street with gravel and a permanent repair cannot be made within the time
specified above due to any of the above mentioned conditions, then the
excavator shall be required to replace the gravel with cold mulch as soon as
possible.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Restoring Bituminous; Concrete Or Asphalt Street Surfaces:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Temporary Grade Surface: Where excavations are made in paved areas,
the surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel surface. The gravel shall
be placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches (6") below the bottom
of the bituminous or concrete surface. Normally, this will require nine inches
(9") of gravel for bituminous surfaces, twelve inches (12") of gravel for
concrete, and concrete base for asphalt wearing surfaces. The gravel shall be
placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled. The temporary gravel surface
shall be maintained by blading, sprinkling, rolling, or adding gravel to
maintain a safe, uniform surface satisfactory to the city until the final
surface is laid. Excess material shall be removed from the premises
immediately. Material for use on temporary gravel surfaces shall be obtained
from sound, tough, durable gravel or rock meeting the following requirements
for gradings:
Â 
Passing 1 inch sieve   100 percent
Passing 3/4 inch sieve 45 - 100 percent
No. 4 sieve            45 - 65 percent
Passing no. 10 sieve   30 - 50 percent
Passing no. 200 sieve  5 - 10 percent
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Bituminous Surface: The exposed edges of existing pavement shall be
primed with type MC-1 bituminous material. The type, grade and mixture of the
asphalt to be used for street surface replacement shall be approved by the
city. The thickness shall be equal to the adjacent surface thickness but not
less than three inches (3"). The complete surface shall not deviate more than
one-half inch (1/2") between old and new work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Policy:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A written warranty in a form approved by the city that if such
trench compaction subsides, sinks or otherwise fails for any reason, or the
pavement over the compacted trench cracks, during the life of said trench, that
the contractor, utility company or other entity will repair and recompact said
trench at no cost to the city according to the standards set forth in
subsection B of this section within thirty (30) days after receiving written
notice that such trench has failed, except that in an "emergency", which is
defined as the failure of any trench due to a natural or artificial condition
and which poses an imminent risk to persons or property, such contractor,
utility company or entity whose trench failed will, within twenty four (24)
hours after receiving notice from the city, undertake all reasonable steps to
protect persons or property from further damage, including, but not limited to,
erecting barricades, warning lights, lanterns, flares, or other devices to
alert the public to the potential hazard. Thereafter, such contractor, utility
company or entity shall commence repairs to the affected trench as soon as
practicable according to the standards set forth herein; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Any contractor, utility company or entity incapable of providing
evidence of a net worth in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) must,
in lieu thereof, also post a cash bond for the estimated and reasonable cost to
repair said trench as established by the city engineer. The city will retain
said cash bond for two (2) years following completion of the trench work. If,
after the expiration of two (2) years, the trench is still intact and has not
subsided, sunk or otherwise failed for any reason, the city will release such
bond after inspection by the city engineer or inspector.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Conflicts: Where the provisions of this section conflict with the
provisions of other sections, the provisions of this section shall take
precedence. (Ord. 4-12-2001, 4-4-2001; amd. 2014 Code)
7-3-5: PROTECTION OF PUBLIC:
Excavation operations shall be conducted in such a manner that a minimum amount
of interference or interruption of street traffic will result. Inconvenience to
residents and businesses fronting on public streets shall be minimized.
Suitable, adequate and sufficient barricades shall be available and used where
necessary to prevent accidents involving property or persons. Barricades must
be in place until all of the excavator's equipment is removed from site and
excavation has been backfilled and proper temporary gravel surface is in place.
From sunset to sunrise, all barricades and excisions must be clearly outlined
by acceptable warning lights, lanterns, flares and other devices. Police and
fire departments shall be notified at least twenty four (24) hours in advance
of any planned excavation requiring street closures or detour. (Ord. 4-12-2001,
4-4-2001)
7-3-6: RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES:
An excavator shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written
consent of the city and without advance notice to the owner of the utility. If
it becomes necessary to relocate an existing utility, it shall be done by its
owner unless the owner otherwise directs. No utility, whether owned by the city
or by a private enterprise, shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless
the cost of such work be borne by the permittee or an expressly written
agreement is made whereby the utility owner and the excavator make other
arrangements relating to such cost. The permittee shall support and protect by
timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which
may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and shall do everything
necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across the
work. In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be
damaged (and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices are
to be considered as part of a substructure), they shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them, but the utility owner shall be reimbursed for the
expense of such repairs by the permittee. It is the intent of this chapter that
the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to substructures, and any
resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such substructure damage and
such assumption of liability shall be deemed a contractual obligation which the
permittee accepts upon acceptance of an excavation permit. The city need not be
made a party to any action because of this chapter. The permittee shall inform
itself as to the existence and location of all underground utilities and
protect the same against damage. (Ord. 4-12-2001, 4-4-2001; amd. 2014 Code)
7-3-7: REVOCATION OR REFUSAL OF PERMIT:
All permits shall be subject to revocation and the city may refuse to issue a
permit for failure of the permittee or applicant to abide by the terms and
conditions of this chapter. (Ord. 4-12-2001, 4-4-2001)
7-3-8: EXCEPTION IN EMERGENCY:
Excavation permits will not be requested prior to excavation in case of
emergency endangering life or property, providing the city is notified as soon
as practicable and a permit is applied for upon the next regular working day
following the emergency. (Ord. 4-12-2001, 4-4-2001)
7-3-9: PENALTY:
Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a class B
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, subject to penalty as provided in
section
1-4-1 of this code, and then must meet all the requirements of this chapter.

in order to facilitate development of adjacent properties and as required by
exigent or emergency conditions, as set forth in this chapter. When granting
exemptions to this chapter, the city council may impose conditions determined
to ensure the rapid and complete restoration of the street and the surface
paving. A grant of an exemption to the moratorium imposed by this chapter by
the city council does not negate or limit a party's obligation to comply with
all other applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and rules for the
disturbance, cutting or trenching of a street. (Ord. 2011.02, 4-14-2011)
7-4-3: EXIGENT CONDITIONS:
Exigent conditions may exist when a project is proposed which would impact a

the city council. Prior to making an exigent encroachment, the party requesting
to do so must obtain all licenses and permits required by applicable laws,
regulations, ordinances and rules for disturbing, cutting or trenching the
street and pay all applicable fees. (Ord. 2011.02, 4-14-2011; amd. 2014 Code)
7-4-4: EMERGENCY DISTURBANCES:
Emergency disturbances, cuts and trenches may be made to streets without prior
permit if the disturbance, cut or trench is reasonably calculated to prevent
loss of life or damage to property which appears to be imminent if the action
is delayed by waiting to secure permits for such excavations or encroachments.
In such emergency situations, the person making the excavation or encroachment
must contact the city immediately and contact must be made with the city
building department within two (2) business days after the emergency in order
to secure an encroachment permit and any other permits required by applicable
law, regulation, ordinance or rule. Emergency situations and conditions do not
negate or limit a party's obligation to comply with, and abide by, applicable
laws, regulations, ordinances and rules, except for the requirement to obtain
proper permits before commencing excavation or encroachment. The party making
an emergency disturbance, cut or trench to a street will be liable for all
costs incurred by the city for returning the impacted street to its prior
condition. (Ord. 2011.02, 4-14-2011; amd. 2014 Code)

water system due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants into the
drinking water supply.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protection Required: No water service connection to any premises shall
be installed or maintained by the city, or any other water utility, unless the
water supply in the premises is protected as required herein.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Notification Of Public: Although failure of a consumer to be aware of
these provisions shall be no defense to violation hereof, the water department
shall use reasonable means to notify its consumers of the hazards of cross
connection and the need for annual inspection of backflow prevention
assemblies. Drinking water system surveys or inspections of the consumer's
water distribution system shall be conducted by individuals deemed qualified by

8-5-3: WRITTEN IMPACT FEE ANALYSIS:
Each IFA contains an executive summary as well as two types of analysis
referred to as the "Impact Fee Analysis" and the Proportionate Share Analysis
described more fully as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Executive Summary: A summary of the IFAs designed to be understood by a
lay person (the "Executive Summary") is included in the attached Exhibit "B"
and demonstrates the need for Impact Fees to be assessed on Development
Activity. The Executive Summary has been available for public inspection at
least ten (10) days prior to the adoption of this Ordinance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Impact Fee Analysis: The City has commissioned the IFFPs and IFAs which
identify the impacts upon public facilities required by anticipated development
activity and the anticipated impacts on system improvements required by
anticipated development activity to maintain the established level of service
for each public facility, demonstrate how such anticipated impacts are
reasonably related to the anticipated development activity, estimate the
proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system improvements that are
reasonably related to the development activity, and identify how the impact
fees are calculated. Copies of the IFFPs and IFAs, are attached as Exhibit "B"
which has been available for public inspection at least ten (10) days prior to
the adoption of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Proportionate Share Analysis: In connection with the IFFPs and IFAs,
the City has prepared a proportionate share analysis which analyzes whether or
not the proportionate share of the costs of public facilities is reasonably
related to the service demands and needs related to new development activity.
The proportionate share analysis identifies, as applicable:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The costs of each existing public facility that has excess capacity
to serve the anticipated development resulting from new development activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The cost of system improvements for each public facility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The manner of financing for each public facility (such as user
charges, special assessments, bonded indebtedness, general taxes or funded
grants) other than impact fees;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The relative extent to which development activity will contribute to
financing the excess capacity of and system improvements for each existing
public facility by such means as user charges, special assessments or payment
from the proceeds of general taxes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The relative extent to which development activity will contribute to
the cost of existing public facilities and system improvements in the future;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The extent to which development cctivity is entitled to a credit
against the impact fees because the development activity will dedicate system
improvements or public facilities that will offset the demand for system
improvements, inside or outside the proposed development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Any extraordinary costs in servicing the newly developed properties;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The time-price differential inherent in fair comparisons of amounts
paid at different times.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â A copy of the proportionate share analysis is included in the IFAs,
which is included in Exhibit "B" and has been available for public inspection
at least ten (10) days prior to the adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 2021.28,
12-15-2021)
8-5-4: IMPACT FEE FACILITIES PLAN:
The City has developed the IFFPs which identify the existing levels of service,
establish proposed levels of service, identify excess capacity to accommodate
future growth at the proposed levels of service, identify demands placed upon
existing public facilities by new development activity at the proposed levels
of service, and identify the means by which the City will meet those growth
demands. The City has chosen to use a planning horizon of ten years in
preparing the IFFPs. The City has considered all revenue sources to finance the
impacts on system improvements, including grants, bonds, inter-fund loans,
Impact Fees and anticipated dedication of system improvements. The City's plan
for financing system improvements establishes that impact fees are necessary to
maintain a proposed level of service that complies with subsection 11-36a-302
(1)(b) or 11-36a-302(1)(c) of the Act. The IFFPs have been prepared based on
reasonable growth assumptions for the service area, and analyze the general
demand characteristics of current and future users of the systems. Furthermore,
the IFFPs identify the impact on system improvements created by development
activity and estimate the proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system
improvements that are reasonably related to new development activity. Said
IFFPs are included in Exhibit "B" and are incorporated into this chapter by
this reference. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-5: CALCULATION AND ENACTMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
The City Council will, by this chapter, approve impact fees in accordance with
the IFFPs and IFAs. In calculating the impact fees, the City has based all
amounts on realistic estimates and the assumptions underlying those estimates
are disclosed in the IFAs, and the City has included the construction costs,
land acquisition costs, costs of improvements, fees for planning, surveying,
and engineering services provided for and directly related to the construction
of system improvements, and outstanding or future debt service charges if the
City might use impact fees as a revenue stream to pay principal and interest on
bonds or other obligations to finance the cost of system improvements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Notice And Hearing: In conjunction with the approval of this chapter,
the City held a public hearing on November 17, 2021, gave public notice of the
IFFPs and IFAs, said hearing and the City's intent to adopt this chapter at
least ten (10) days before the date of said hearing by posting notice in at
least three (3) public places within the City, publishing notice in newspapers
of general circulation in the City and on the Utah Public Notice Website, made
a copy of this Ordinance, the IFFPs, the IFAs and the Executive Summaries
available to the public on the City's website and at the City's offices, all in
conformity with the requirements of Utah Code Annotated 11-36a-502. After the
public hearing, the City Council adopted this Impact Fee Ordinance as presented
herein.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Contents Of The Ordinance: This chapter adopting or modifying the
impact fees contain such detail and elements as deemed appropriate by the City
Council, including designation of the service area within which the impact fees
are to be calculated and imposed. This chapter herein includes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A schedule of impact fees to be imposed, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The formula to be used by the City in calculating impact fees.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Adjustments: The standard impact fee may be adjusted at the time the
fee is assessed in response to unusual circumstances, to fairly allocate costs
associated with impacts created by a development activity or project, or due to
a request for a prompt and individualized impact fee review for the development
activity of the State of Utah or a school district or charter school and an
offset or credit for public facilities for which an impact fee has been or will
be collected. The standard impact fee may also be adjusted to ensure that
impact fees are imposed fairly for development activities attributable to low
income housing or other development activities with broad public purposes. The
impact fee assessed to a particular development may also be adjusted should the
developer supply sufficient written studies and data to the City showing a
discrepancy between the fee being assessed and the actual impact on the system
improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Previously Incurred Costs: To the extent that new growth and
development activity will be served by previously constructed improvements, the
impact fee may include public facility costs and outstanding bond costs related
to improvements previously incurred by the City. These costs may include all
projects included in the IFFPs which are under construction or completed but
have not been utilized to their capacity, as evidenced by outstanding debt
obligations. Any future debt obligations determined to be necessitated by
growth activity may also be included to offset the costs of future capital
projects. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-6: DEVELOPER CREDITS:
Development activity may be allowed a credit against Impact fees for any
dedication of land for a system improvement, any building and dedication of
some or all of a system improvement, any dedication of a public facility that
the City and the developer agree will reduce the need for a system improvement,
or a dedication of land for, improvement to or new construction of any system
improvement by the developer if the facilities are system improvements or are
dedicated to the public and offset the need for an identified system
improvement. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-7: IMPACT FEES ACCOUNTING AND EXPENDITURES:
The City will account for and hold Impact Fees as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Accounting And Holding: The City will establish a separate interest-
bearing ledger account for each type of public facility for which an impact fee
is collected, deposit all impact fees in the appropriate ledger account, retain
the interest earned on each account in the ledger account, and otherwise
conform to the accounting requirements provided in the Impact Fees Act. Impact
fees collected prior to the effective date of this chapter should also meet the
requirements of this section.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Reporting: At the end of each fiscal year, the City shall prepare a
report pursuant to Utah Code Ann. Â§ 11-36a-601. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-8: EXPENDITURE OF IMPACT FEES:
The City may expend Impact fees pursuant to Utah Code Ann. Â§11-36-602 only for
system improvements that are (i) identified in the IFFPs and (ii) for the
specific Public Facility type for which the fee was collected. Impact fees
collected pursuant to the requirements of this chapter are to be expended,
dedicated or encumbered for a permissible use within six (6) years of the
receipt of those funds by the City, unless the City identifies in writing an
extraordinary and compelling reason why the fees should be held longer than six
(6) years and an absolute date by which the fees will be expended. Impact fees
will be expended on a First-In First-Out ("FIFO") basis, with the first funds
received deemed to be the first funds expended. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-9: REFUNDS:
In accordance with Utah Code Annotated Â§ 11-36a-603, the City shall refund any
impact fees paid by a developer, plus interest actually earned, when (i) the
developer does not proceed with the development activity and files a written
request for a refund; (ii) the fees have not been spent or encumbered within
the "Time of Expenditure" as defined herein; and (iii) no impact has resulted.
An impact that would preclude a developer from a refund from the City may
include any impact reasonably identified by the City, including, but not
limited to, the City having sized facilities and/or paid for, installed and/or
caused the installation of facilities based in whole or in part upon the
developer's planned development activity even though that capacity may, at some
future time, be utilized by another development. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-10: OTHER IMPACT FEES:
To the extent allowed by law, the City Council may negotiate or otherwise
impose impact fees and other fees different from those currently charged. Those
charges may, at the discretion of the City Council, include but not be limited
to reductions or increases in impact fees, all or part of which may be
reimbursed to the developer who installed improvements that service the land to
be connected with the City's system. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-11: ADDITIONAL FEES AND COSTS:
The impact fees authorized hereby are separate from and in addition to user
fees and other charges lawfully imposed by the City and other fees and costs
that may not be included as itemized component parts of the impact fee
schedule. In charging any such fees as a condition of development approval, the
City recognizes that the fees must be a reasonable charge for the service
provided. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-12: FEES EFFECTIVE AT TIME OF PAYMENT:
Unless the City is otherwise bound by a contractual requirement, the impact
fees shall be determined from the fee schedule in effect at the time of payment
in accordance with the provisions of section
8-5-14, below. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)
8-5-13: IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL FEE OR REFUND AFTER DEVELOPMENT:
Should any developer undertake development activities such that the ultimate
density or other impact of the development activity is not revealed to the City
either through inadvertence, neglect, a change in plans, or any other cause
whatsoever, and/or the impact fee is not initially charged against all units or
the total density within the development, the City shall be entitled to recover
the total Impact Fee pursuant the IFFPs and IFAs from the developer or other
appropriate person covering the density for which an impact fee was not
previously paid. (Ord. 2021.28, 12-15-2021)

PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY: Thoroughfares which are dedicated for perpetual public
use and are administered by the governing entities in which they are located.
SUBDIVISION: The division of a tract, or lot or parcel of land into two (2) or
more lots, plots, sites or other divisions of land for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of sale or building development or redevelopment, and a
plat has therefore been recorded in the office of the county recorder under a
unique name to identify one subdivision from another. In property
identification context, "subdivision name" may also be used to identify other
conditional use or project names.
THOROUGHFARE: Any rights of way, under public or private ownership for public
use, designed for the travel of motorized vehicles to enter and exit through
passage and to include the ways used for internal circulation of traffic.
THOROUGHFARE NAME: The alphabetic name assigned, not including the street type
designator to identify both public and private thoroughfares, which are on the
citywide grid, and is one of the primary components of a legal situs address.
THOROUGHFARE NUMBER: The name of a thoroughfare designated with numerals
according to its numerical position on the citywide grid relative to the
baseline or meridian axis streets. Thoroughfare numbers never contain
alphanumeric characters (e.g., 2nd South Street). When a thoroughfare number is
designated, a directional corresponding to its orientation on the citywide grid
is also required (e.g., 200 South Street).
THOROUGHFARE TYPE: A standardized identification descriptor which corresponds
to physical and functional characteristics of a thoroughfare (i.e., "Avenue",
"Bay", "Boulevard", "Circle", "Court", "Cove", "Drive", "Expressway", "Lane",
"Parkway", "Place", "Road", "Row", "Street" and "Way").
UNIFORM PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM: The established regulations and
guidelines, as revised from time to time, which define specific procedure for
the design and designation of address numbers on all houses and buildings,
including occupancy units therein, as well as the design of names and numbers
for streets, both public and private, including standards for street
intersection markers (signs).
UNIT LOCATOR: The last component of a legal situs address which is an
alphabetical or numerical code used to identify a one to one correspondence
between a building and high density occupancy structures within the building,
such as suites, rooms, apartments and condominium units. (Ord. 2008.02, 3-13-
2008, eff. 3-13-2008; amd. 2014 Code)
9-2-5: NAMES OF STREETS DESIGNATED IN OFFICIAL STREET AND ADDRESS FILES:
All streets and thoroughfares of the city, whether public or private, shall be
known by the names by which they are so designated in the official street and
address files of the city, filed in the office of the planning commission, with
such additions, changes and corrections of the names as shall from time to time
be placed in the official files by ordinance. (Ord. 2008.02, 3-13-2008, eff. 3-
13-2008)
9-2-6: SYSTEM OF NUMBERING:
The planning commission, in numbering the houses and buildings upon the streets
and thoroughfares of the city, shall adhere to the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Initial Point Of Intersection: The initial point of intersection in the
citywide grid system shall be the junction of Toquer Boulevard (meridian
street) and Center Street (baseline street) in the city, and the numbering
shall extend thence east, west, north and south. Address numbers shall be even
on the north and west sides of the street and odd on the east and south sides
of the street. One hundred (100) numbers shall be assigned to each identified
grid block with the lowest number beginning at a point nearest the initial
point of intersection in the citywide grid system. Address numbers shall be
determined by the number grid in which the property is located. Address numbers
in central areas with no grid shall be assigned in relation to adjacent
addressing.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New Residential Subdivisions: In new residential subdivisions, each
standard sized lot shall be given a preassigned street number by the planning
commission upon final plat approval. Address numbers shall be assigned to large
lots relative to their capacity to be subdivided into two (2) or more minimum
sized lots for the minimum width allowed by the zoning district. In commercial
areas, addresses will be assigned as development plans for those lots are
approved, prior to building permits being issued.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Calculation Of Address Number: Address numbers shall be determined by
calculation. The distance from the center of the property to the last corner of
the citywide grid shall be measured to get a thoroughfare number. The
thoroughfare number is then added to the block number to get the address (i.e.,
if the block number is 1200 and the location number is 43, the address is 1243
or 1244, depending upon which side of the thoroughfare the building is placed.
In other words, the address is the percent of the total distance into the
block, plus the block number).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Series In Thoroughfare Intersections: When thoroughfare intersections
are within one hundred twenty feet (120') of a grid line, the number series
change shall be made at the intersection to be more logical to the public. When
a long block faces two (2) blocks divided by a street or thoroughfare, the
number series on the long block shall change at the intersecting street or
thoroughfare so that houses or buildings facing each other have compatible
addresses.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Diagonal, Curving Streets: Diagonal streets which run forty five
degrees (45Â°) or less from a north/south line will be numbered by the north/
south grid, and those more than forty five degrees (45Â°) from the north/south
line will be numbered by the east/west grid. Curving streets will be assigned
numbers based upon the grid of their greatest length. For instance, if the
beginning is more south than west of the end, then the north/south grid will be
used.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Loop Streets, Thoroughfares And Cul-De-Sac Streets: On loop streets and
thoroughfares and cul-de-sac streets, address numbering shall begin at the
entrance nearest the initial point of intersection within the citywide grid
system and increase to the opposite end as if the street were in a straight
line. Block number changes will be made every three hundred thirty feet (330'),
with odd and even number remaining on the same side of the street as they
began.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Apartments:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Apartment buildings on thoroughfares shall be assigned individual
addresses. Apartments clustered about a central parking area immediately facing
a public street shall also be assigned separate addresses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When apartments are arranged along a private street or thoroughfare,
addresses can be assigned from this private street or thoroughfare. A sign
showing the apartment complex name, with the street address below it, must be
posted at the entrance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Each apartment must be identified on the exterior entrance by number
or building letter and number for multiple buildings. The numbers shall be in
sequence (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.). Apartments in lettered buildings shall have the
building letter as part of each apartment number, such as B-210. When units are
on multiple floors, ground floor numbers shall be in the 100 series (101, 102,
103), second floor numbers shall be in the 200 series (201, 202, 203), etc. If
a common hallway is used for several apartments, the external hallway entrance
to each apartment shall contain a list of the apartments served. When
addressing townhouses and other buildings containing units separately owned,
each address shall be placed on the principal external entryway to the unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The official address for each apartment shall be the building
address, as described in subsection G3 of this section, followed by the
apartment number (for example, "223 Greenway Dr., Apt. 3"). Addresses for units
in apartment buildings not on a public thoroughfare shall include the public
thoroughfare address and the building number with the apartment designation.
The official address for each apartment will be the public thoroughfare address
followed by the building letter, a dash and the apartment number (for example,
"223 Greenway Dr., Apt. B-111").
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Mobile Home Parks:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When trailers are arranged along a private thoroughfare within
mobile home parks, each private thoroughfare within the mobile home park shall
be named and a sign, as required by this chapter, shall be erected on each
private street within the mobile home park.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Each mobile home on such a private thoroughfare shall then be
identified in numerical sequence as determined by calculation, as described in
this chapter. The number shall be placed in a conspicuous place on the part of
the trailer closest to the thoroughfare, and all mobile homes within the mobile
home park shall be marked in the same location of the trailer. Address numbers
shall be a minimum of three inches (3") high with block letters and shall be
visible from the street. All other provisions of this chapter on the
installation of identification numbers shall be applicable to mobile homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â It shall be the requirement of the mobile home park owners, who are
registered with the city, to make sure that each private street within the
mobile home park is properly named and such name shall be approved in advance
by the planning commission or its designated representative, and it is further
the responsibility of the mobile home park operator to make sure that each
mobile home is properly addressed and the number posted as set out in this
chapter.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Commercial Or Office Buildings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Commercial or office buildings on public thoroughfares or private
thoroughfares shall be assigned individual addresses. Commercial or office
buildings clustered about a central parking area immediately facing a public
thoroughfare shall also be assigned separate street addresses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When a commercial building or office building complex is arranged
along a private driveway or around a private parking area, the complex shall be
addressed off the public or private thoroughfare serving the complex.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Each suite or unit in a commercial or office building must be
identified on the exterior entrance by number or building letter and number for
multiple buildings. The numbers shall be in sequence (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
Suites or units in lettered buildings shall have the building letter as part of
each suite or unit number, such as B-203. When units are on multiple floors,
ground floor numbers shall be in the 100 series (101, 102, 103), second floor
numbers shall be in the 200 series (201, 202, 203), etc. If a common hallway is
used for several suites or units, the external hallway entrance to each
commercial or office building shall contain a list of the suites or units
served.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The official address for each commercial or office suite or unit
shall be the building address followed by the suite or unit number (for
example, "223 Greenway Dr., Suite 3"). Addresses for suites or units in
commercial or office buildings not on a public thoroughfare shall include the
public thoroughfare address and the building number with the suite or unit
designation. The official address for each suite or unit will be the public
thoroughfare address followed by the building letter, a dash and the suite or
unit number (for example, "223 Greenway Dr., Suite B-2").
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Content Of Identification: Each property identification number must
contain:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A frontage number component which is numerically sequenced and
assigned to a structure or parcel according to subsections A through H of this
section;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A direction component referencing the city grid quadrant and the
compass direction in which the frontage numbers run, abbreviated with the
single letter equivalent for its compass direction (N, E, S or W);
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A thoroughfare name component consisting of either an alphabetic
name or a number name, but not both;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Thoroughfare type component, which modifies the name to distinguish
specific locational, functional and physical characteristics of the
thoroughfare;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A unit, suite, apartment or mobile home locator component if
required by subsections G through I of this section. (Ord. 2008.02, 3-13-2008,

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â There are a number of activities related to the use, sale and
development of land that have been determined by federal and state law to be in
the public interest for local government to oversee and regulate in order to
bring about the safe, orderly creation and maintenance of communities. These
include such activities as subdividing land into lots for sale, building
structures, constructing roads, installing utilities, etc.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In order to effectively regulate these activities, communities are
empowered to establish review and permitting processes. This title contains the
review and permitting processes related to land development activities in the
city. In addition, other sections of this title that relate to land use, such

Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority may not entertain an appeal of a matter in
which the Appeal Authority, or any participating member, had first acted as the
Land Use Authority.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Appeals To The Appeal Authority:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â As a condition precedent to judicial review, each adversely affected
person may specifically challenge a Land Use Authority's decision, within
fifteen (15) days of the land use decision and pay the related fee as may be
set by the City Council, amended from time to time, and designated in the
City's uniform fee schedule.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority shall determine the correctness of a decision
of the Land Use Authority in its interpretation and application of a land use
ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Only those decisions in which a Land Use Authority has applied a
land use ordinance to a particular application, person or parcel may be
appealed to the Appeal Authority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the
action appealed was made shall be presented to the City Clerk with the
application for hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â For every appeal, the applicant shall present to the Appeal

Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority shall respect the due process rights of each of
the participants in providing them with proper notice, right to be heard at a
hearing and right to have legal counsel present and participate at said hearing
if he/she/it so desires.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â After the hearing, the Appeal Authority may give a preliminary
decision, but shall issue a written decision within sixty (60) days after the
hearing or after an applicant has submitted their appeal or variance request
for decision and waiving their right to hearing in writing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â If an appeal of a land use decision is lodged with the City, the
City Council may waive the requirements of subsection F1 of this section, and
allow the applicant to make their appeal directly to the 5th District Court, in
and for Washington County, State of Utah.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Variances: Any person or entity desiring a waiver or modification of
the requirements of a land use ordinance as applied to a parcel or property
that he owns, leases, or in which he holds some other beneficial interest may
apply to the Appeal Authority for a variance from the terms of the ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority may grant a variance only if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The literal enforcement of the ordinance would cause an
unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of the land use ordinances;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zoning district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zoning
district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and
will not be contrary to the public interest; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial
justice done.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance
would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection G1a of this section, the
Appeal Authority may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged
hardship:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The hardship is self-imposed or economic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In determining whether or not there are special circumstances
attached to the property under subsection G1b of this section, the Appeal
Authority may find that special circumstances exist only if the special
circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Relate to the hardship complained of; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in
the same zoning district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the
conditions justifying a variance have been met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Variances run with the land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority may not grant a use variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â In granting a variance, the Appeal Authority may impose additional
requirements on the applicant that will:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived
or modified.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Interpretation Of Land Use Ordinance: Any person alleging there was an
error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Land
Use Authority in the administration or interpretation of the land use ordinance
may request an interpretation and decision from the Appeal Authority in
accordance with this subsection H.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority will grant a waiver to the decisions of the
Land Use Authority only as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â If the decision or requirement by the Land Use Authority
conflicts with the intent or literal interpretation of the land use ordinances;
or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â If the decision or requirement by the Land Use Authority
conflicts with State or local laws.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In some instances, the Appeal Authority may not fully understand the
intent of an ordinance or requirement placed upon any person(s) by the Land Use
Authority. Under these circumstances the Appeal Authority may obtain a decision
from the City Council prior to making a final decision (if applicable).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If the Appeal Authority requires an interpretation from the City
Council, the Appeal Authority shall make a final decision within ten (10) days
after that interpretation is given.

entity adversely affected by any decision of the Appeal Authority may petition

Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the petition for review, the petitioner may only allege that
there was an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Land Use Authority in the administration or interpretation of the land
use ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The petition is barred unless it is filed within thirty (30) days
after the Appeal Authority's decision becomes effective, which three (3) days
after the written decision is issued by the Appeal Authority and mailed via
first class mail to the applicant at the address designated in the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority shall transmit to the reviewing court the
record of its proceedings including its minutes, findings, orders, and, if
available, a true and correct transcript of its proceedings. If the proceeding
was tape recorded, a transcript of that tape recording is a true and correct
transcript for purposes of this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review of the Appeal Authority's decision shall be done by the court
in the manner and upon the standards provided by law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The appellant has the burden of proving that the Appeal Authority
erred.

10-4-1: TITLE:
This chapter, when adopted, shall be referred to as the TOQUERVILLE CITY
AMENDED ANNEXATION POLICY PLAN. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-2: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
This amended annexation policy plan (the "plan") is written to provide
Toquerville City (the "city") with a growth plan that shall guide the
development and expansion of municipal boundaries through annexation in a
manner that is consistent with the city's general plan, the city's land
management code, and the laws of the state. The purpose underlying the plan is
to protect and enhance the private property rights of property owners within
the municipal boundaries and in the unincorporated areas surrounding the city.
(Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-3: CONTENT OF PLAN; REQUIREMENTS:
Under Utah Code Annotated section 10-2-401.5(3), this plan must include an
expansion area map, criteria that shall guide future annexation decisions, and
justification for excluding certain areas from the proposed expansion area.
Each of these requirements is discussed below:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Expansion Area Map: As part of the ongoing effort to plan and prepare
for responsible growth within the municipal boundaries of the city, the city
has identified territory adjacent to its present boundaries that may be
petitioned for annexation to the city in the future. The areas proposed for
possible future annexation may or may not be bordered by other municipalities.
Areas petitioned for annexation must fall within the areas designated for
future annexation in this amended annexation policy plan, as shown in the
future expansion area map attached as exhibit A to the ordinance codified
herein, and incorporated herein by this reference. All areas of possible future
annexation shall be delineated on the future expansion area map ("future
expansion areas").
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Guiding Criteria: Pursuant to Utah Code Annotated section 10-2-401.5,
the following criteria shall guide the city in deciding whether or not to grant
future annexation petitions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Character Of The Community: The current and future character of the
city, as identified in the city's general plan, is mixed residential,
agricultural, recreational and commercial. It is anticipated that light
industry and more business will begin to move into the area with the approval
and to the benefit of the city. Areas to be annexed shall be compatible with
the needs of the city and its residents. Applicants for annexations shall show
the city that annexation of their property will assist in the retention of the
city's current and anticipated character. Even if property proposed for
annexation is located within a future expansion area, there is no guarantee
that the annexation petition will be approved or accepted by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Need For Municipal Services In Developed And Undeveloped
Unincorporated Areas: The city favors annexation of developed and undeveloped
areas where there is a current need for municipal services or where there are
plans for future development that, when carried out, will create a need for
municipal services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Plans For Extension Of Municipal Services:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â When feasible, the city favors annexation where services can be
incorporated into the existing city utilities. The city also favors annexation
of property that may be developed to allow utility and transportation systems
to be incorporated into a comprehensive plan for the entire area, including any
master plans developed by the city as well as the city's general plan. The city
shall support the Ash Creek special service district in its efforts to supply
sewer services to the city and other areas within its service area. The city
does not favor the annexation of areas for which it does not have the
capability or intention of providing basic municipal services, such as
transportation, culinary and secondary water, wastewater (sewer) removal,
stormwater retention and removal, public safety services, parks and recreation
services, phone, audio and video services, electrical services, and natural gas
service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â In areas where municipal services are not presently extended,
service shall be extended on an as needed basis at the developer's expense. All
extensions of municipal services shall comply with all city ordinances and
policy criteria. An annexation agreement shall be prepared between the city and
future developers outlining specific requirements relating to water, sewer,
transportation, electricity, telecommunications, fiber optic, and other
specific improvements prior to annexation approval. Agreements will also be
made prior to annexing property that has already been developed and being
serviced by Ash Creek special service district and the Washington County water
conservancy district. An approved annexation petition shall allow developers of
the annexed property to connect to city facilities, provided all
infrastructures proposed to be connected meet city specifications and comply
with all applicable development and land use ordinances. When annexation is
approved, the newly annexed area shall receive the following available
services: fire protection; police protection; planning and zoning; maintenance
of dedicated city streets; and other municipal and utility services provided by
the city at the time of annexation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Financing Of Municipal Services: The manner in which infrastructure
additions are developed will have a bearing on how they are financed. The
increased valuation of property and the subsequent increase in property and
sales tax revenues will help increase contributions to the city general fund.
This increase will help defray the added cost of providing services to the
annexed areas. The costs of capital improvements, such as utilities, streets,
curb, gutter and sidewalks, storm drain systems, and other improvements as
shall be deemed necessary in the annexed area shall be borne by the developer
as development within the areas occurs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Estimate Of Tax Consequences To Residents Both Currently Within
Municipal Boundaries And In Expansion Area: All petitions for annexation shall
include an estimate of the tax consequences that the proposed annexation will
have on persons or entities that reside or are located within the city's
preannexation boundaries and on persons or entities who reside or are located
in the areas proposed to be annexed. The city shall not approve an annexation
if doing so will require an increase of the tax liability or impose double
taxation on any person or entity that resides or is located in the city's
preannexation boundaries, unless such person or entity also owns real property
or also is located in the area proposed to be annexed. As to persons or
entities that reside or are located in the areas proposed to be annexed, the
city may increase the tax liability or impose new tax liabilities on such
persons or entities: a) to defray the costs of providing such persons or
entities with municipal services; or b) pursuant to an agreement between such
persons or entities and the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Interests Of Affected Entities: The city is concerned about the
interests of "affected entities", as that term is defined in Utah Code
Annotated section 10-2-401, and shall ensure that applicants and its own staff
comply with notice requirements to said persons or entities. The city shall
consider all written comments from any such persons before approving any
annexation petition by ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Miscellaneous Considerations: The city, in considering the approval
or denial of an annexation petition, shall consider the following principals of
the municipal planning and urban/rural development:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Eliminating and/or not creating islands or peninsulas of
unincorporated territory;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Consolidating overlapping functions of government entities, such
as Ash Creek special service district and the Washington County water
conservancy district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Promoting efficient delivery of services; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Encouraging the equitable distribution of community resources and
obligations.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Justification For Excluding Areas Of Urban Development: There are areas
within one-half (1/2) mile of the city's current boundary that contain urban
development and that are excluded from the future expansion area. All of these
areas, however, are already incorporated into other municipalities and, for
that reason, have been excluded. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014; amd. 2014 Code)
10-4-4: COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL AND STATE LAW AND POLICY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Compliance With City Municipal Code And Land Management Code: It is the
policy of the city to require development in annexed areas to comply with city
standards and regulatory laws. This requirement includes the city's land
management code, construction and design standards for public utilities and
other uniform codes adopted by the city by ordinance (such as the international
building code and international fire code) as amended from time to time.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Compliance With State Annexation Law: Any annexation petition must
comply with the requirements of Utah Code Annotated section 10-2-403.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Contiguousness: Areas to be annexed must be contiguous to the corporate
limits of the city at the time of submission of an annexation petition. Areas
to be annexed shall not be located within the corporate limits of another
incorporated city or be a part of a previously filed annexation petition that
has not been denied, accepted or approved.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Sensitive Lands: It is the policy of the city to avoid development of
wetlands, hillsides, critical environmental habitat areas, expansive soils, or
any other environmental conditions that threaten the integrity of the city
infrastructure unless, in the annexation agreement, the developer can show how
he/she/it will mitigate these issues in conformance with the city ordinances,
this code and federal and state regulations.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Motives For Annexation: The city shall not annex property for the sole
purpose of acquiring revenues or retarding another municipality's ability to
annex the same property. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-5: PROCESSING AND REVIEW FEES:
The city recorder, upon receipt of an annexation petition that complies with
the requirements of Utah Code Annotated section 10-2-403, shall impose such
fees as established by the city council to recover the costs of processing such
petition. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-6: ZONING/DENSITY OF ANNEXED PROPERTY:
Upon successful completion of all annexation procedures set forth in section
10-4-2 of this chapter, and Utah Code Annotated section 10-2-401 et seq., the
annexed property shall possess the zoning designation of multiple use 20 (MU-
20). If the applicant for annexation desires to have a different zoning
designation instantly upon the city adoption of an ordinance granting the
requested annexation, they must follow the following procedure:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Identification Of Requested Zoning/Density: Applicants seeking a zoning
designation other than MU-20 must identify in its annexation petition the
target zoning designation he/she/it is seeking.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Compliance With Normal Procedures For Seeking Amendment To City Zone
District Map: Once an annexation petition has been accepted (thus triggering
all notice and contest periods, but before approval of an ordinance granting
annexation), the city shall follow all normal procedures required by chapter 8
of this title for the modification of the city zone district map. Although the
property to be annexed is not technically part of the incorporated area of the
city, said compliance shall include, but is not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Payment of all zone change application fees;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A public hearing and recommendation for approval or denial of
requested zoning designation by the planning commission; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A public hearing and finding by the city council that the requested
zoning designation complies with the standards set forth in subsection 10-8-3B
of this title, meets with the spirit of the city's general plan and the
policies set forth in this plan.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Findings Warranting Differing Zoning Designation: After conducting a
public hearing, but prior to adopting any ordinance granting an annexation, the
city council shall make a finding that the requested zoning designation other
than MU-20 is acceptable or unacceptable, or any new modification acceptable to
the city council. Applicants shall retain all rights to withdraw their
annexation petition if they are unwilling to stipulate to the city council's
findings as to zoning designation. If the city council finds in favor of
granting a zoning designation other than MU-20, it shall expressly designate in
its ordinance granting the annexation which zoning designation the property
shall possess upon incorporation. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-7: GENERAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING ANNEXATION:
The city, after public input and research, finds the following with regard to
annexation:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is not anticipated that an annexation will cause any adverse
consequences to the residents currently living within the city or living within
the area annexed, except that there may be temporary and/or slight reductions
in general service available to current residents as a result of expansion of
services into the newly annexed territory.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â It is anticipated that the residents in the newly annexed territory
will experience an increase in their Property Taxes due to the difference in
certified tax rates between the City and the County.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â It is further anticipated that as the City receives the Property Tax
revenue from the newly annexed territory, the level of services for the entire
community will be increased.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â It is further anticipated that property owners in the newly annexed
territory may experience reductions in fire and property insurance rates.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â As the area continues to grow and becomes more populated, additional
development planning may occur. Incorporation and consideration of these plans
and development in compliance with the City's General Plans, public
infrastructure master plans, the City's Land Management Code and the City's
construction and design standards for public improvements, will allow a
comprehensive system of infrastructure to serve future growth and development
in the annexed areas. (Ord. 2014.08, 12-11-2014)
10-4-8: ANNEXED PROPERTY:
An ordinance of Toquerville City, Utah ratifying and restating Toquerville City
ordinance #2015-1 and Toquerville City ordinance #2016-11 annexing certain
property to be known as the wind song annexation located north by north east of
Anderson Junction, and incorporating the same within the corporate boundaries
of Toquerville City pursuant to the provisions of title 10, chapter 4
(annexation) of the Toquerville City Code, as amended; setting the zoning
classification of said property in conformance with the recommendations of the
Toquerville City Planning Commission; adopting the annexation plat map of said
property; and providing for an effective date.

The Mayor, the Building Official and the Planning and Zoning Administrator are
designated as the persons to administer and enforce the provisions of this
title and all other land use regulations adopted by the City. The Mayor, when
deemed necessary, shall recommend legal action to enforce the provisions of
this title or other land use regulations. The failure of any persons to

2014 Code)
10-5-2: COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS PRIOR TO RECORDATION OF FINAL PLAT, SITE
PLAN OR THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Policy: In order to protect residents and property owners of the City
from dangerous and undesirable conditions that result from unfinished public
improvements and site work, such as erosion or flooding, as well as a lack of
fire protection and emergency response facilities and access and pedestrian
access, it is the policy of the City that no certificate of occupancy will be
issued by the City unless and until all public improvements and site work for
the property upon which the building or dwelling is located has been completed
or in instances where the installation of said public improvements and site
work would be pointless, the owner has agreed in a written recorded covenant
that runs with the land, that when the installation of said public improvements
and site work is appropriate and warranted (as determined by the City) that the
owner will participate financially and otherwise in the City's installation of
said public improvements and site work.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Procedure: For the construction of a building or dwelling, the owner
(or its developer) shall provide to the City the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Application: A building permit application designating the name and
contact information for the owner of the property, the developer (if
different), the contractor (and license number), the size and dimensions of the
building (in square feet), the names and contact information of all anticipated
subcontractors preforming a material sub-trade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Detailed Building Plans: A detailed set of building plans showing
all components of the building including foundation, framing, plumbing,
electrical, HVAC, roofing that have been engineered, reviewed and approved by a
licensed and bonded structural engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Detailed Site Plan: A detailed site plan showing the location and
nature of drainage work, grade changes, retaining walls, buildings, permanent
structures, utility connections, service lines and meters shall be submitted to
the City's Building Department prior to issuance of building permit. The site
plan shall be reviewed and approved by a licensed and bonded civil engineer and
surveyor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Fees (Impact And Connection): Payment of all impact and connection
fees as calculated by the City's staff in compliance with the City's uniform
fee schedule.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Other Information: All other information, reports, certificates,
proof of insurance or licensure as may be required by the City's Building
Department and chapter 6 of this title.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Construction According To Approved Plans: The City shall not issue a
certificate of occupancy for a building or dwelling unless all required public
improvements and site work have been constructed in accordance with the plans
approved by the City's Building Department, in its sole discretion, except as
specified in section
10-5-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 2017.14, 11-9-2017)
10-5-3: SECURITY FOR COMPLETION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Approval Conditions: In the event that public improvements and site
work are not completed, inspected and City approved by the time a building or
dwelling is completed and ready for occupancy, the City may issue a certificate
of occupancy; provided, that all of the following conditions are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The building or buildings, or portions thereof to be occupied have
been constructed in accordance with the approved plans for those buildings, and
are in full compliance with applicable Building and Safety Codes, and are
completed to the extent that only public improvements and site work remains
unfinished;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The City Building Department determines that occupancy of the
buildings, or portions thereof, prior to completion of required public
improvements and site work is safe, and that access for emergency vehicles is
adequate with the site improvements unfinished; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The owner/developer posts adequate security for the benefit of the
City and the public to ensure completion of the public improvements and site
work in full compliance with the approved building and site plans, the City's
standards and specifications for public improvements and all Building and
Safety Codes adopted by the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Form Of Security Arrangement: The security arrangement to be provided
to the City by the owner/developer in exchange for a deferral of the City's
requirement to install all necessary public improvements and site work prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a building or dwelling, may only
be one of the following types:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Cash On Deposit: A cashier's check or a money market certificate
made payable only to the City and deposited into one of the City's accounts
maintained with the State of Utah or a Federally insured financial institution.
The amount of the deposit shall be determined by the City and shall be equal to
one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the amount reasonably estimated by
the City Engineer as being necessary to complete all remaining public
improvements and site work shown on the approved building and site plans. In
the event that the owner/developer disputes the cost estimate of the City
Engineer, the owner/developer may prove lower construction cost by providing
binding contracts between the owner/developer and a licensed and insured
general contractor or subcontractor appropriate to perform the required work at
a stated, fixed price. These contracts must be supported by a full security
agreement, ensuring performance by the subcontractor or contractor. Bid
proposals are not satisfactory for this purpose. If the contracts submitted are
acceptable in form, the amount of security required shall be one hundred twenty
five percent (125%) of the total contract price of all such contracts
submitted, plus the estimated reasonable cost of performing any work not
covered by the contracts. Specifications in such contracts shall be
sufficiently clear to identify the work called for under the contract.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Security Escrow: A trust or escrow account maintained by: a) a State
or Federally chartered (and Federally insured) financial institution, b) a law
firm with a Utah IOLTA trust account, or c) an escrow company licensed in the
State of Utah, containing immediately available funds in the amount designated
in subsection B1 of this section. The trust or escrow account shall be subject
to a Cash on Deposit Control Agreement in a form acceptable to the City
Attorney which is executed by both the owner/developer, the City and the
financial institution, escrow company or law firm where the proceeds of the
account are being held in trust for the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Recorded Deferral Agreement: In lieu of any other type of security
arrangement, upon submittal of a deferral application, the City Council, upon
making a finding of unusual circumstances, such as the inability to determine
the proper grade and dimensions of necessary public improvements or the likely
construction of the public improvements and site work as part of a larger City
project or special assessment area ("SAA") project, may allow an owner or
developer to defer completion of required public improvements and site work
pursuant to written deferral agreement recorded in the official records on file
in the Office of the Recorder of Washington County, State of Utah. Said
deferral agreement must be signed by all owners of the affected property and at
a minimum shall require the owner to: a) covenant to pay for completion of the
public improvements and site work relating to their property at such time as
the City determines, in the City's sole discretion and in the manner the City
determines, including but not limited to, through a special assessment area
(SAA), and/or b) waive and release any objection to the creation of any SAA
that would fund the completion of the improvements. When recorded, the benefits
and the burdens of said deferral agreement shall attach to the entirety of the
property and shall be a covenant that runs with the land.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â General Terms Applicable To All Security Arrangements: The terms of any
security arrangement, whether expressly incorporated therein or not, shall
include, but is not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An incorporation by reference of the City approved building plans
and site plan for the building or dwelling and all data required by section
10-6-2 of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The covenant to complete the public improvements and site work
within a period of time not to exceed one year from the date the Certificate of
Occupancy is issued by the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In cash on deposit or security escrow situations, a stipulation that
the security proceeds may be reduced upon request of the owner/developer as the
public improvements and site work are installed. The amount of the reduction
shall be determined by the City. Such requests may be made only once every
thirty (30) days, and no reductions shall be authorized until such time as the
City Building Department or Public Works Department (as the case may be) has
inspected the public improvements and/or site work and found them to be in
compliance with City specifications and approved plans. All reductions shall be
granted only by the written authorization of the Mayor or his/her designee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In cash on deposit or security escrow situations, a covenant that if
the security proceeds are inadequate to pay the cost of the completion of the
public improvements and site work according to City specifications for whatever
reason, including previous reductions, then the owner/developer shall be
responsible for the deficiency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â In cash on deposit or security escrow situations, if, after giving
the owner/developer a written demand for payment pursuant to a deferral
agreement or control agreement and the expiration of thirty (30) days, funds
are not received by, or transferred to, the City within thirty (30) days of the
demand, then the City's costs of obtaining the demanded amount, including
attorney's fees and costs or outside attorney fees and court costs, shall be
deducted from the security proceeds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â An acknowledgement that the cost of completing public improvements
and site work shall include reimbursement to the City's Public Works Department
and/or City Engineer and all other City departments for the costs of
administration of the completion of the improvements, including inspection
costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â A covenant to hold the City harmless and defend it from any and all
liability that may arise as a result of the public which are installed until
such time as the City accepts the improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â A stipulation that the time period for the completion of the
required public improvements and site work may only be extended in the
following manner:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Upon approval of the City Council, the time period may be
extended an additional one year from the expiration date of the original
security agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Said approval shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney's
Office and in compliance with all provisions of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â All public improvements and site work required under this title and
the City's standards and specifications for public improvements shall be
designed and installed by an engineer, contractor or subcontractors licensed by
the State of Utah.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Payment Of Interest: Any interest accruing while cash is on deposit
with the City or on deposit with a 3rd party such as a financial institution,
escrow company or law firm, shall, unless expended for completion of public
improvements and site work required, inure to the benefit of the City and not
the owner/developer. Accordingly, the City shall not be required to pay
interest to an owner/developer on any funds deposited as part of a security
arrangement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Release Of Funds: The City shall relinquish and return funds held on
deposit with the City or under a security escrow with financial institution,
escrow company or law firm for the purpose of paying for public improvements
and site work once completed and accepted by the City. The City shall release
funds equal to the actual cost of performing the public improvements and site
work as the work progresses, minus ten percent (-10%). Upon satisfactory
completion of all required public improvements and site work, all funds shall
be immediately released to the owner/developer, except those funds required to
secure project during the one year warranty period.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Modification Of Plans: An owner/developer may request modifications to
plans covering public improvements and site work by submitting revised building
plans and site plans to the City Engineer for review and final action. If the
modification of the building plans and site plans increases the cost of
required site public improvements, additional security must be provided by the
owner/developer to cover the increased costs.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Phased Projects: Public improvements and site work applicable to each
phase of a phased project or development pursuant to chapter 19, article F of
this title shall be completed or security for completion provided as each phase
is constructed and either platted or occupied. Site improvements or other
phases of the project shall be completed or security offered as those phases
are completed. (Ord. 2017.14, 11-9-2017)
10-5-4: PENALTY:
Any person, firm or corporation, as principal, agent, employee or otherwise,
violating, causing or permitting violation of the provisions of this title
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, as per
1-4-1 of this Code. In addition, the City may bring an action to enjoin the
continuation of the violation. Each day a violation continues shall be
considered a separate violation and offense. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd.
2014 Code; Ord. 2024.06, 5-2-2024)

other entity bonded to ensure the accuracy of the title information.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Vicinity Map: A map showing the project location relative to the city.
The map may be at any legible scale, and may be an inset on another plan or
drawing (e.g., existing conditions plan). It should show the city boundaries,
major roads (e.g., Highway 17) and minor roads that serve the property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Development Report; Statement Of Intent:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The name and location of the property and applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the applicant is represented by an agent, a statement from the
applicant authorizing the agent to act;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The name and address of the person, firm or organization preparing
the application and a statement indicating the record owner's permission to
submit the application;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â An explanation of the purpose of the proposed action and proposed
land use, including building descriptions, variations in building setbacks,
parking, height or other requirements that are being sought;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A development schedule indicating the approximate date the
development or stages of the development with expected completion dates;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Assessment of the availability and capacity of public infrastructure
(utilities, roads) to serve the proposed use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Any special agreements, conveyances, restrictions or covenants,
which will govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the
development and any of its common areas.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Development Agreement: A document signed by the applicant prior to
approval of final plat or building permit that memorializes the obligations,
commitments and representations made by the proponent in review meetings, as
well as any conditions of approval. The development agreement may include or
substitute for a security agreement insofar as it contains commitments to site
improvements secured by a bond or other form of security. All minutes of public
review sessions are incorporated into the development agreement by reference.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Soil/Geology Report:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A detailed soil/geology report is required during the preliminary
consideration of all building permits and subdivision plats. It shall be based
upon adequate test borings, excavations and geologic evaluations prepared by a
geological/engineering firm specializing in soil mechanics and licensed by the
state. Excavations and/or borings shall be located on or near the proposed
building site. Reduced cost shall not be justification for more distant
convenient locations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Additional soil/geologic investigation may be required if the report
indicates the presence of conditions that, if not corrected or adequately
addressed through design, could lead to structural damage or premature
deterioration or subsidence of the building or damage to surrounding
improvements, whether public or private, or damage to surrounding lots. Such
conditions may include, but not be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Expansive soils.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â High water table.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Soluble mineral veins.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Slope instability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Buried slides.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Buried stream channels.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Fault zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The investigation shall include visual appraisal of adjacent lots
for surface geologic/topographic conditions, which could threaten the proposed
building site. The soil/geologic report shall also:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Recommend corrective action or building design specifications
intended to prevent potential dangers found in the investigation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â State whether the site is buildable or unbuildable because of any
potentially threatening conditions which are not economically or technically
correctable or avoidable by currently known building practices and codes. (One
such example would be the existence of an active or inactive deeply buried
landslide.)
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Covenants, Conditions And Restrictions: Covenants, conditions and
restrictions (CCRs) shall be required for all subdivisions. CCRs shall include
by reference the landscaping requirements outlined in this title and the
minimum design guidelines and standards as adopted by the city council by
resolution and may also include other conditions or restrictions as determined
by the subdivider. Two (2) copies of the CCRs shall be submitted with the final
plat.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Security Agreement: Prior to approval of final plat or occupancy
permit, as required under chapter 5, "Enforcement", of this title, the
applicant shall enter into a security agreement that memorializes the terms and
type of security (such as a bond, letter of credit or escrow account) to
guarantee the timely completion of site improvements that are the obligation of
the applicant.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Verification Of State Registration: Proof of Utah department of
commerce, division of real estate registration and full compliance with the
provisions of Utah Code Annotated section 57-11-1 et seq., as amended, the Utah
land sales practices act.

compliance with Utah Code Annotated section 57-11-7.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Descriptions Of Key Plan/Drawing Contents (Section
10-6-1, Table 3 Of This Chapter):
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Site Boundaries With Dimensions: Show on all plans the property
boundaries, accurately depicted on a sheet at least twenty four inches by
thirty six inches (24" x 36") with bearings and distances based on a recorded
plat. Include a copy of the recorded plat with other submittals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Boundaries Of Protection Areas: Show official boundaries of wetlands
(as per U.S. army corps of engineers), floodplains (100-year, as per U.S. FEMA
maps, or engineering calculations), and spring and well protection areas (as
determined by the city engineer).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Existing And Proposed Topography: Show contours at not more than two
foot (2') intervals for areas of less than ten percent (10%) slope and not more
than five foot (5') intervals for areas over ten percent (10%) slope. Such
contours shall be based on county data when available. The closest city survey
monument shall be used and its location/elevation noted. Clearly designate the
following slope categories:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Zero to ten percent (10%) slopes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Eleven (11) to twenty five percent (25%) slopes;

10-15A-7: DESIGN GUIDELINES:
The city council may, upon written recommendation of the historic commission,
prescribe, adopt and enforce rules and guidelines to administer and carry out
the intent of this article:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Objectives: The design guidelines which follow are set forth as a guide
for those engaged in development and/or rehabilitation of properties in the
historic district. They are specified to ensure the creation of an environment,
blending the existing and new developments into a harmoniously functioning
area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Considerations: Buildings within the historic district should be
considered as integral parts of the overall design and developed with
appropriate consideration for both proposed and existing buildings with respect
to height, mass, siting, location, materials, orientation, signs, lighting and
use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Signs: All signs within the historic district shall be part of an
overall design scheme and shall conform to the sign standards contained in
section
10-15A-8 of this article.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Underground Utility Lines: All utility lines shall be installed
underground whenever feasible.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Rehabilitation Guidelines: Rehabilitation of significant historic
buildings shall comply with the guidelines set forth herein and, in addition,
all applicable statutes, codes and ordinances, as amended from time to time,
relating to the use, maintenance, construction and occupancy of the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Standards: All improvements shall be generally in accord with the
general and specific standards for historic preservation as prepared by the
historic commission and in harmony with the architectural character of the
neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â New Additions: Whenever possible, new additions or adaptive reuse to
structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or changes
were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would not be impaired.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Parking, Access: Off street parking, loading facilities and
pedestrian access shall be designed so as not to create conflicting movement.
All other areas, other than driveways, parking areas, walks and terraces, shall
be appropriately landscaped and provided with appropriate trees and shrubbery.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Ancillary Structures: Ancillary structures, such as garages, storage
sheds and the like, where practical, shall be improved in a manner suggested by
the historic commission to meet code requirements and be aesthetically
pleasing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Restoration: Restoration of all exterior facades, including the side
and rear facade, shall be in keeping with the objectives herein. Roofline,
windows and exterior facing materials shall all be considered. Adjoining
buildings in separate or the same ownership shall be rehabilitated so as to
carry out a unified concept.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Materials: Materials, techniques and colors must conform to and
harmonize with original materials and techniques. To this end, the emphasis
should be, where practical, on correct period sash, doors, cornices, wall
materials and signs and the removal of present day anachronisms, such as
defacing or out of scale contemporary features. The general requirements shall
apply particularly to visible surfaces on the exterior. New work adjoining old
must be carefully blended to minimize separation, unless, in the opinion of
qualified architectural experts, it is better to make the adjoining areas
obvious and thereby emphasize the qualities of the original work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Repairing Details: When repairing or replacing masonry details,
decorations or parapet walls, care should be taken to prevent an obvious and
unsightly patch. Materials, joints, etc., should match the original as closely
as possible in composition, color and texture.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Fake Details: Fake historic details, decorations and other additions
should be avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Reanchoring: Sagging details, decorations, cornices, string courses,
lintels, arches, pilasters and parapet walls should be firmly reanchored.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Deteriorated Details: Deteriorated building details should be
repaired rather than replaced. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the original material in composition, design, color and
texture.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Paint: Heavy or numerous coats of paint, or paint in wrong color
that obscures architectural decoration and detail should be removed before
repainting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Hardware: Hardware and lighting fixtures, where practical, shall be
selected with care to conform to authentic work of the period, and to match
remaining originals where such exist.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Compatible Design: If the original or significant detail no longer
exists or is too deteriorated to save, it is recommended that a contemporary
design be undertaken which is compatible with the rest of the building in
scale, design, materials, color and texture.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Materials:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Original building wall material should not be covered with any
form of inappropriate siding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Masonry facing shall be cleaned and painted as necessary.
Sandblasting is prohibited unless approved by the historic commission. All
repainting, when necessary, shall be done by specification as set forth in
brief 2, U.S. department of the interior.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Recommended materials for rehabilitation of masonry buildings
include traditional bond pattern, such as running bond, not stack bond. Clay
facing tile may be used if the face size of the tile is that of standard brick
and if the bond pattern is typical of contributing buildings in the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The use of imitation stone veneer or brick using stucco, plastic
or plywood/fiber panels is not acceptable, unless documented through historic
or pictorial evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Asphalt or wood shingled awnings and diagonal sided panels are
not acceptable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Vinyl or aluminum panels imitating clapboard or wood siding are
not acceptable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Glazing shall be clear, nonreflective and untinted, though the
use of double glazed insulating glass or materials such as acrylic or high
impact polycarbonate panels is permissible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Wall surfaces that have not been painted should remain unpainted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Color:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Color for all rehabilitation work should blend with the existing
palette. If any new brick is used, it should be similar in texture and color to
that of the original brick. Stucco for exterior walls should be similar in tone
to muted pastels typical of historic pioneer stucco buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â White or off white may be used on decorative elements, such as
lintels, sills and cornices. Bright colors are not appropriate for major
architectural elements, such as building walls. However, when used sparingly in
fine lines, such as on the wood trim of a storefront, a brighter color than
that of the building face can enhance a particular color scheme.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Metallic finishes generally are not acceptable, except when used
in such treatments as painted gold or bronze toned lettering on storefront
glass.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Colors for wood or for metal windows, doors and storefronts
should accent the color used for exterior walls. Too many colors should be
avoided. A simple color scheme of a few colors is generally preferable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Mechanical Equipment:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Radio, television, telephone and/or telecommunication equipment,
such as antennas of satellite dishes and ancillary systems, cables, junction
boxes and the like, shall be placed behind or within suitable visual barriers
in such a way so as not to be visible from the street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Heating and air conditioning equipment, including cooling units,
blowers, exhaust fans, ducts and/or ancillary systems, support units, brackets,
wiring, junction boxes and the like, shall be properly screened or installed
behind or within suitable visual barriers.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New Construction: The guidelines in this subsection are to be used by
those planning new construction within the historic district boundaries. Their
purpose is to reinforce and enhance the historic architectural character of the
neighborhood by encouraging compatible new construction:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Considerations: The historic commission will consider design
concepts other than those recommended in these guidelines though approval of
alternative approaches is not guaranteed. However, in order for a design to be
considered for exceptional review, it must not include the use of elements that
are designated as inappropriate in the guidelines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Siting: The ground floor of a new structure should relate to the
pedestrian's human scale and continue to display the siting of neighborhood
structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Scale:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â One of the many criteria that must be considered when designing
new buildings is the scale of the new building and its relationship to the
scale of the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â It is important that the elements within the building's facade
also be appropriately scaled. The scale of those elements should recall those
of neighboring structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Width Of Building: The apparent widths of the front facades of new
buildings should correspond to typical widths of the buildings on the same
block. A long facade should be broken into separate elements to suggest facade
widths or bays similar to those of neighboring buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Windows: Original windows in older buildings are predominantly the
wood double hung type. A sash pattern of one over one, that is, one undivided
framed pane above a similar pane, is the most common type. In new construction,
one over one type is recommended. However, the pattern of a one over one window
may be achieved by the use of fixed glass, with three (3) conditions: a) that
the window frame replicates the proportions of a typical double hung window
sash; b) that no unpainted clear aluminum is used for the frame; c) that the
window frame is of similar cross sectional size to that of the double hung
windows typical of the neighborhood. Other configurations will be evaluated for
streetscape compatibility on a case by case basis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Ornamentation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The ornamental details used in new construction should be
compatible and in scale with those used in the historic district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When used, cornices, roof types, gables, dormers, turrets,
corbelled parapets, string courses, lintels, arches, pilasters and column
styles which are sympathetic with adjacent buildings will have a unifying
effect and will be considered appropriate. Duplication, where noted, is not
necessary and is to be avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Color: Color schemes will be considered in the design review in
terms of their appropriateness as part of the building facade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Develop a color scheme for the entire building that coordinates
all facade elements. Choose a base color that will link the entire building
together, including signs, ornamentation, awnings and entrances if applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Muted colors are preferred for background colors of most
buildings. A darker background color will allow use of lighter colors for trim
where the highlights will show up better.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Use bright colors for accents only, such as signs, ornamentation
and entrances. In most cases, only one or two (2) accent colors should be used
in addition to the base color.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Finish wood surfaces. The rustic bare wood look is not part of
the heritage of the historic district. Painted surfaces are most appropriate.
Stains will be accepted in combination with materials that give a wall a
finished appearance. Rustic finishes will not be approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Leave natural masonry surfaces unpainted where feasible. For
other parts of the building that do require painting, select colors that will
complement those of the natural materials. If an existing building is already
painted, consider applying new colors that simulate the original brick look.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Select neutral or muted colors for roofs. Brown and gray were the
dominant colors in the past because of the materials used. Wood shingles and
sheet metal traditions remain today and should be respected. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-
18-2012)
10-15A-8: SIGN REGULATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permitted Signs: Permitted signs include low profile monument type
signs (1 per parcel of property or complex), provided they are wood carved,
sandblasted or engraved metal and do not exceed four feet (4') in height and
are not more than sixteen (16) square feet in area for individual business, or
twenty four (24) square feet for multiple businesses. Uplighting is permitted
with four feet (4') of sign. All other signs must comply with subsection 10-22-
7A8 of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prohibited Signs:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Roof signs, or any sign projecting above the roofline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Off premises signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Flashing signs, including any sign or device in which the artificial
light is not maintained stationary and constant in intensity or color at all
times when in use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Signs made of cardboard, paper, canvas or similar impermanent
material.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Bubble shaped awnings and awnings with a shiny or wet look.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Other prohibited signs identified in the City sign ordinance.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Additional Provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Painted signs should be in subdued earth tone colors only. Day-glo
or fluorescent signs are not permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Electric signs, including neon, are permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The lettering style should be simple and in keeping with the
architectural character of the neighborhood. The amount of information on a
sign should be kept to a minimum. A variation in lettering styles is
permissible, but should be kept to a minimum.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All permanent signs shall be integrated into the architectural
design of the building on which they are placed and into the overall sign
layout of the project in character and quality. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd.
2014 Code)
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Request For Permit Or Appeal: Requests for a permit to place a sign in
the Historic District must be submitted to the Historic Commission for their
approval. The applicant for a permit may make an appeal of such decision to the
Appeal Authority. The decision of the Appeal Authority will be final. (Ord.
2018.07, 12-13-2018)
10-15A-9: DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS NOT DESIGNATED AS LANDMARK SITES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application; Considerations: When an application is made for a
demolition permit affecting a historic building which is not designated as a
landmark site, the Historic Commission shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Review the condition of the building to determine the impact of the
demolition to the neighborhood and the technical feasibility for preserving the
structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Inform the property owner of economic incentives available to
rehabilitate historic resources;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Encourage the property owner not to demolish the building until an
attempt can be made to locate suitable tenants to make the building
economically viable, or find a purchaser who is willing to acquire and
rehabilitate the structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review proposed new construction within the neighborhood;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The application shall also describe the reason for demolition and
any development proposed for the demolition site, including renderings of the
proposed new structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Requirements For Approval: Demolition permits for historic buildings
not designated a landmark site shall not be approved until the Historic
Commission has had a reasonable time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, to review
the proposed new construction, and make recommendations regarding compliance
with the Historic District design standards. Granting of the permit shall be
determined after review of Historic Commission recommendations by the planning
commission and recommendations to the City Council. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-15A-10: REVIEW AND PERMIT PROCEDURE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Review Of Regulations: The developer is to secure a copy of this
article to review the regulations regarding development in the Historic
District.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Consideration By Historic Commission: When a request for a building
permit is made to the City based upon an exterior design proposal, the Historic
Commission shall review, at a minimum, the site plan, exterior design of the
buildings, architectural treatment, landscaping, design of signs and other
items related to design objectives, to determine whether proposed construction
substantially complies with Historic District design standards and make a
report to the Planning Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Exterior Design Proposal Review: The Historic Commission shall review
the exterior design proposals for significant historic buildings within the
district. Exterior proposals shall include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any rehabilitation, reconstruction or addition to the exterior of a
significant historic building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any demolition or relocation of a significant historic building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any new construction within the Historic District, except for minor
additions to existing nonhistoric buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Any sign proposed to be placed or modified with the Historic
District.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Planning Commission Approval Required: All exterior design proposals
shall be subject to Planning Commission approval after recommendation from the
Historic Commission. No building permit shall be issued in the Historic
District without this approval.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Continuing Review: The Historic Commission and City staff shall
exercise continuing review of a project as it progresses from conceptual stage
through construction and completion to ensure compliance with the Historic
District design standards and Planning Commission approvals. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-
18-2012)
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Denial; Request For Exemption, Appeal: In the event of a denial of a
permit by the Planning Commission, an applicant may request an exemption as
provided in subsection G of this section, or may appeal to the Appeal Authority
for approval. On appeal to the Appeal Authority, its decision shall be final.
(Ord. 2018.07, 12-13-2018)
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Exemption: A property owner may be exempted from the restrictions
imposed by this article on significant historic buildings by applying for an
exemption. The applicant shall state the reasons why: 1) the building is no
longer suitable for the present purposes; and 2) the applicant cannot earn a
reasonable return from use or rental of the building if altered, reconstructed
or demolished with the limitations and guidelines adopted under this article.
Determination of whether a building is appropriate for exclusion from the
application of this article shall be made by the Planning Commission upon
recommendation by the Historic Commission. If an applicant desires to appeal
denial of an exemption or the Historic Commission desires to appeal the
granting of an exemption, the applicant or Historic Commission may request
consideration by the City Council, and its decision, after public hearing,
shall be final. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)

10-15C-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A master planned development overlay zone is intended to provide an
alternative to the conventional zoning and land development approaches to
encourage the most creative and innovative development of land. This overlay
zone may allow the standards of this article to be applied to all areas of the
city. It is the intent of this article to assure that the character of the
underlying zones and surrounding districts is maintained in harmony with the
city general plan and to satisfy the requirements of applicable design
guidelines and design standards and specifications for construction.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â It is further the intent of this article to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Promote economical and efficient use of the land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Promote the clustering of dwelling units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Enhance and blend development with the unique natural character of
the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Promote creative architecture that blends with the character of the
land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Provide a harmonious variety of housing types.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Encourage a higher level of project amenities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Preserve the unique scenic qualities of open space. (Ord. 2012.04,
1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2021.09, 6-16-2021)
10-15C-2: INTERPRETATION:
By its nature and purpose, the master planned development overlay zone is
intended to provide flexible land development approaches and regulations.
Insofar as the application of the regulations and concepts contained herein
conflict with the strict construction requirements and provisions of this
article and/or other provisions of this title, or other land use ordinances,
the provisions of the regulations provided under this article shall control.
For example, the application of clustering, in the setback and building
separation provisions in this article, may conflict with the setback and
building separation provisions of the underlying zone as specified in this
title. However, uses, including both permitted and conditional uses, specified
for each zoning district in this title shall not be modified by the application
of the regulations in this article. It is not the intent of the MPDO to replace
the simple, conventional, or phased subdivisions as described in section 10-19.
The MPDO is intended for subdivision with such size, geographic challenges or
complexity that could not be facilitated in a subdivision specified in section
10-19. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2021.09, 6-16-2021)
10-15C-3: COORDINATION WITH OTHER LAND USE DOCUMENTS:
This article, together with chapter 19 of this title, the city general plan,
this title and the zoning map, and applicable city design guidelines, shall
guide the use and development of all land within the corporate boundaries of
the city. However, in order to accomplish the purpose and intent of this
article, conflicts and regulations provided in other city ordinances as they
apply to land use and development, shall be construed in such a way as to allow
the more flexible approach of the master planned development overlay zone.
(Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2021.09, 6-16-2021)
10-15C-4: VESTED RIGHTS:
There shall be no vested right to bonus incentives or other flexible design
treatments, including clustering, merely by virtue of filing an application
under this article. The planning commission and city council have discretion to
approve or deny any amenities proposed for the purposes of calculating density
based on the desirability of the proposed amenity and its consistency with
overall purposes and intent of this article and uses in design of the applicant
project and surrounding properties. Application under this article shall be
treated as an application for a subdivision approval under chapter 19, article
D of this title, for purposes of vesting the application of this title,
regulations and standards to any given application. At any time in the review
process under this article, a developer may elect to opt out and have the
application reviewed as a traditional subdivision application under chapter 19,
article D of this title. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2021.09, 6-16-
2021)
10-15C-5: REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conformance With General Plan: The land uses and design of the proposed
MPDO shall be consistent with the city general plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum Qualifications:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A master planned development overlay zone shall be required for
developments in excess of a minor partition of a parcel one hundred (100) acres
in size or greater, characterized by slopes in excess of fifteen percent (15%).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â On parcels less than one hundred (100) acres, an MPDO may be
authorized if one or more of the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Unusual physical features of the property or the surrounding area
prohibit development under the standard provisions of this title while
preserving a physical or terrain feature, or view corridor of importance to the
neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The property cannot be feasibly developed under the standard
provisions of this title, particularly in the case of small undeveloped parcels
surrounded or partially surrounded by developed property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The development under the MPDO regulations is more creative,
unique and desirable to the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The property/parcel proposed for development is under unified
title with one unified description.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Uses In Master Planned Development Overlay Zone:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any use or combination of uses may be allowed in an MPDO, provided
such uses are consistent with the city general plan and underlying zone
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Mixed uses, including limited neighborhood commercial and multi-
family residential, may be allowed within one project. However, the development
shall be a harmonious variety of building types within one project and in
keeping with the objectives of this article.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Development Standards: The MPDO shall be designed and developed in a
manner consistent to chapter 19, articles D and E of this title, the design
standards and specifications for construction, capital facilities plan and
general design guidelines and approved by the planning commission.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Lot Sizes: The minimum lot and siting requirements of the zoning
district in which the MPDO lies shall not dictate the strict guidelines for
development within the MPDO, but shall serve to inform the developer of the
importance of developing a project that will be in harmony with the character
of the surrounding neighborhood. An MPDO shall not be subject to the lot width
and lot area requirements of the underlying zone. The lot width and size will
be shown on the approved site plan as approved by the planning commission.
Notwithstanding the preceding, if a perimeter of a proposed MPDO is adjacent to
an established residential area or approved plat that is zoned R-1-20 or
larger, the MPDO conceptual and final plan shall indicate perimeter lots with
residential density no less than R-1-20 zoning density unless the applicant can
provide evidence that this would make it impossible to develop the ERUâ€™s
established in their base density. If the applicant desires density bonuses
thru the MPDO process, the applicant should designate, at a minimum, a buffer
of adjacent lots of at least the size requirements of the R-1-20 zone or
alternative transition buffers such as parks or open space.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Single Housing Type Not Inconsistent With Intent: An MPDO which only
involves one type of housing, such as all detached or all attached units, shall
not be inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this article and
shall not be the sole basis for denial.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Architectural Style, Appearance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â While there should be some flexibility for individuality, homes
within a development should be of similar character and style to promote
harmony within the project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The exterior color and materials of all buildings, structures, walls
and fences shall comply with general design guidelines and approved by the
planning commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Architectural style of buildings shall not solely be a basis for
denial of the plan. However, the overall appearance and compatibility of
individual buildings to other site elements or to surrounding development will
be primary consideration during the MPDO review.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Street Utilities, Services And Public Facilities: The uniqueness of
each proposal for an MPDO may allow specifications and standards for streets,
utilities and services to be subject to minor modifications. The plans and
specifications and profiles of all streets, utilities and services shall be
reviewed by the city staff and the city engineer prior to final approval.
Approval of infrastructure plans is required before final approval for an MPDO
may be granted.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Open Space, Parks, Park Strips, Medians, Trails And Others:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of open space is to provide areas within
developed parcels of land that are restricted from development and reserved for
uses such as parks, trails, floodway areas, landscaping and topographic
features worthy of protection. Open space does not include streets, driveways,
parking areas or setback areas. It is the intent of open space requirements to
promote a more clustered development land use and encourage the preservation of
undeveloped land for a healthier environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â General Requirements: The following general requirements pertaining
to open space shall be incorporated into the development design and implemented
by the developer in compliance with city design standards and specifications
and other applicable city design guidelines:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where parks, trails and other open space are mastered, planned by
the city, proposed by the developer, or required on a parcel or parcels, the
developer shall incorporate said open space into the design concept plan for
the project and submit the concept plan with suggested improvements, funding
and maintenance mechanisms for approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Trails, parkways, and common areas shall be dedicated to the city
or retained as private property, at the discretion of the city. On all trails,
parkways and other common area retained as private, the developer shall grant
an easement to the city and other agencies for access or maintenance on and
over the area. Such easements shall not necessarily give the general public
access.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â All open space not specifically dedicated to the city, or
accepted for ownership or maintenance by the city, shall be perpetually owned
by and maintained by the owners or their agents through a special taxing
district or homeowners' association with the power to collect fees for
maintenance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Open space shall be clearly designated on the preliminary and
final development plans as to the use and improvements, and may include the

simultaneously with the excavation of the mineral resource or may be reclaimed
in phases as approved by the planning commission and city council. Excavation
shall be planned so as to progressively develop the proposed final landforms by
grading and stockpiling overburden materials in areas designated for future
landforms according to the approved reclamation plan. Such areas are to be
seeded and planted immediately after final reclamation grading is completed or
within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and planting
shall be completed within one year of completion of the phased extraction under
the approved plan, unless a subdivision preliminary plan has been approved
which includes an alternative landscaping plan and timetable which is approved
by the planning commission and city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â If extraction or reclamation is proposed to be phased, no
extraction shall begin in subsequent phases until extraction is completed in
any prior phase and appropriate reclamation security has been posted for any
such subsequent phase.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Any approved phased extraction and reclamation shall be
incorporated into the extraction/excavation permit and shall be subject to
review each year. Failure to comply with reclamation timetables and conditions
may result in suspension of the extraction/excavation conditional use permit
pending completion of such remediation conditions as may be imposed by the
planning commission based on annual review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Topographic map. This shall reflect the phases of reclamation and
the final site reclamation, including the approximate final finished grade of
the site and all slopes. The map will be prepared on a scale of one inch equals
two hundred feet (1" = 200'), with a maximum contour interval of two feet (2').
This map should represent the site and all property within five hundred feet
(500') of the project boundary.

and processing activities, all buildings, equipment and utilities used in the
administration and management of the operations shall be removed. This removal
shall be completed within the first ninety (90) days following the completion
of mining operations.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Plan Modification: Plan modifications may be submitted any time during
the reclamation process. The modifications must be submitted to the planning
commission with adequate documentation supporting the request. If the planning
commission approves the modification, then the amended reclamation plan will
govern the final process. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)

the written authorization signed by the mayor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â If the security proceeds become inadequate to pay the actual cost of
the completion of the reclamation/improvements according to city specifications
for whatever reason, including previous reductions, then the owner/developer
and/or permittee shall be responsible for the deficiency and no further permits
of any type shall be issued until the reclamation/improvements are completed or
a new security agreement has been approved and executed to ensure completion of
the remaining reclamation/improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â If, upon written demand of the city after expiration of the security
time period, the security proceeds are not transferred to the city within
thirty (30) days of the demand, then the city costs of obtaining the proceeds,
including the city attorney fees and costs or any outside attorney fees and
court costs paid by applicant may be deducted from the security proceeds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the security proceeds after the expiration of the
reclamation time period, the costs of completion shall include reimbursement to
the city for the costs of administration of the completion of the improvements,
including inspection costs, and other applicable costs and fees, including
attorney fees incurred by the city in the enforcement of the security agreement
and reclamation plan.

CHAPTER 16
SENSITIVE LANDS
SECTION:
10-16-1: Introduction
10-16-2: Statement And Applicability
10-16-3: Purpose
10-16-1: INTRODUCTION:
Toquerville is located in a unique area of Utah where sagebrush and black brush
of the cooler Great Basin Desert (ecosystem) merge with yuccas and cactus of
the hot Mojave Desert (ecosystem) and pinions and junipers of the high Colorado
Plateau (ecosystem). This rare collision of three (3) ecosystems results in a
delicate biological area called an ecotone. Plants and animals common to the
Mojave Desert ecosystem can be seen in the same location with those of the
Great Basin Desert ecosystem and the Colorado Plateau ecosystem. The area is
biologically rich with a large variety of plants and animals. In addition,
several species, such as the shivwits milkvetch and the sandpaper bush are
found here in this ecotone and nowhere else in the world. Over millions of
years the cracking, dropping and thrusting of the earth's surface created a
structural diversity of hills, ledges, soil types, sandstone outcroppings and
lava boulders in southern Utah. The water activity of Ash Creek, LaVerkin Creek
and other tributaries and washes carved and enriched the area leaving it with
stunning views and surroundings.
The lands of Toquerville vary in biological sensitivity, ecological diversity
and resiliency. In order to be accountable and properly manage and protect
these differences, the sensitive lands ordinance (SLO) has been set up to
oversee development and promote public health and safety. For example, natural
area open space (NAOS) may be one of the appropriate development tools utilized
to ensure specific environmental features, including native vegetation, washes,
ridgelines, peaks and viewscapes are protected. This chapter is not intended to
deny reasonable use of the land, but rather guide its use in ways that are
sustainable while recognizing the unique opportunities and responsibilities
this setting provides. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-16-2: STATEMENT AND APPLICABILITY:
The sensitive lands ordinance (SLO) is an overlay district. The underlying
zoning districts that define the allowed uses and development standards for
each property still exist (residential, commercial, etc.) and are modified by
the specific provisions included with this chapter. Where there is a conflict
between the regulations of this chapter and an underlying district, this
chapter will take precedence. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-16-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the sensitive lands regulations is to identify and protect
environmentally sensitive lands in the city and to promote the public safety
and welfare by providing appropriate and reasonable controls for the
development of such lands. The objectives to be achieved include the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Protect people and property from hazardous conditions characteristic of
sensitive land and their development. Such hazards include rockfalls, rolling
boulders, other unstable slopes, flooding, flood related mudslides, sinking,
erosion and sedimentation.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Protect and preserve significant natural and visual resources. Such
resources include, but are not limited to, major boulder and lava outcroppings,
large boulders, major ridges and peaks, prime wildlife habitat and corridors,
unique vegetation specimens, significant washes and significant riparian
habitats.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Protect renewable and nonrenewable resources, such as water quality,
air quality, soils and natural vegetation from incompatible land uses.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minimize the public costs of providing public services and facilities
in sensitive land areas, such as streets, water, sewer, emergency services,
sanitation services, parks and recreation. Costs associated with the design and
development of infrastructure in environmentally sensitive areas can be higher
than costs in other areas of the city due to the unique and fragile nature of
such lands.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Conserve the character of the natural landscape. Guide the location and
distribution of meaningful on lot and common tract open space and protect
sensitive features to sustain the unique desert character found in sensitive
land areas.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Recognize and conserve the economic, educational, recreational,
historic, archaeological and other cultural assets of the environment that
provide amenities and services for residents and visitors.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Assure that decisions regarding development in sensitive areas are
based on complete and accurate information about the environmental conditions,
including drainage features and probable development impacts.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Encourage innovative planning, design and construction techniques for
development in sensitive areas to minimize visual and site impacts of
development.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Retain the visual character of the natural landscape to the greatest
extent feasible by regulating building mass, location, colors and materials;
grading location, design and treatment; and landscaping design, materials and
restoration of cuts and fills.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Maintain significant open spaces which provide view corridors and land
use buffers, protect landmarks, large boulders, lava rock and sandstone
outcroppings, predominant lava rubble fields, and prime wash habitats by
preserving these features in their natural state to maintain the city's unique
desert ecotone setting.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Protect sensitive lands, while also recognizing the legitimate
expectations of property owners and city's general plan. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-

greater than 30%. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2020.15, 7-16-2020)
10-16A-6: SLOPE AND SLOPE AREAS DETERMINED:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Applicability: Slope shall be determined on an individual development
parcel basis as an average percent natural slope for purposes of density
limitations. Except as permitted by subsection
10-16A-5.C. of this Title, all property with a slope greater than thirty
percent (30%) shall be excluded from the calculation of the development parcel
area for purposes of determining density limitations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Procedure: The location of the natural ten percent (10%), sixteen
percent (16%), twenty four percent (24%) and thirty percent (30%) slopes for
the purposes of this article shall be determined using the following procedure:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Preparation Of Contour Maps: Current contour maps shall be prepared
and certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor showing contours
at intervals no greater than five feet (5') (the "contour map") drawn at one
inch equals two hundred feet (1" = 200') scale maximum.

the applicant by the city engineer to verify the accuracy of the contour lines
shown on the contour map. The contour map shall identify profile lines, which
shall be used for performing the field survey. Profile lines shall be
perpendicular to contour lines and in no case occur at intervals greater than
one hundred fifty feet (150') apart or seventy five feet (75') from a property
line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Determination Of Slope Areas For Density Calculations: Using the
contour maps, slopes shall be calculated in intervals no greater than forty
feet (40') along profile lines. Points identified as slopes of ten percent
(10%), sixteen percent (16%), twenty four percent (24%) and thirty percent
(30%) shall be located on the contour map and connected by a continuous line.
That area bounded by said lines and intersecting property lines shall be used
for determining dwelling unit density. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord.
2020.15, 7-16-2020)
10-16A-7: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permit Required: All major development on slopes in excess of ten
percent (10%) or within a geologic hazard area shall require a hillside
development permit granted by the city council prior to any excavation or
construction activity. The hillside review board shall first review all
proposed major development for compliance with this and other city ordinances
and standards, including appendix J of the international building code, and
make a recommendation to the planning commission and city council for approval,
conditional approval or denial of the proposed development. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-
18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Included Major Development: Major development shall include subdivision
platting, including townhomes and condominiums, multi-family residential
projects, commercial, industrial buildings or excavation which involves a
vertical cut greater than four feet (4') or involves excavating a surface area
larger than one acre.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minor Excavation: Minor excavation involves vertical cuts of four feet
(4') or less and also disturbs less than one acre of surface area.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Exceptions: Permit approval under this section shall not be required
for projects which have received an excavation permit, or for preliminary plats
which have been approved by the city council prior to the adoption date hereof,
and permitting as required under the prior chapter shall continue to have
application. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-16A-8: APPLICATION REPORTS:
Any applicant for a major development, as defined in subsection 10-16A-7B of
this article, on slopes greater than ten percent (10%) within either the
hillside development overlay zone or within a geologic hazard area shall be

Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A schedule shall be included showing when each stage of the project
will be completed, including the estimated starting and completion dates.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Drainage Control Plan And Report: A drainage control plan and report
prepared by a licensed professional civil engineer registered in the state
shall be submitted with each application. The design of the drainage control
system shall be based upon the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All drainage systems shall be separate and independent from the
sanitary sewer system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Drainage and flood control shall be designed in conformance with the
city plan and approved by the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Property development shall not cause a natural drainage channel to
be filled in, obstructed or diverted. When modification to a natural drainage
channel is proposed within the development, such changes will be addressed in
the drainage study and shown on the improvement plans, and the developer may be
required to dedicate right of way or record drainage easements for structures
and/or improvements needed to carry storm runoff in the event approval is given
for the proposed modifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The point of location where the natural drainage channel enters and
leaves the property may not be changed without approval of the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â All of the drainage basin upstream of the development shall be
considered to be fully developed in conformance with the city's current land
use general plan. Effects on the downstream property owners relative to
increased flood potential and nuisance water shall also be considered in the
design, including acquisition of easements or agreements where necessary, or
construction or modification of improvements where needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The developer shall provide the necessary means to assure drainage
within the property being developed by making use of existing facilities or
natural washes and constructing master planned improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â In general, it shall be required that each new development handle
its stormwater runoff in such manner that no net increase in storm runoff above
the natural state will occur on the downstream properties. In other words, the
preproject flows must not be exceeded by the postproject flows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Streets are significant and important in urban drainage and full use
shall be made of streets for storm runoff up to reasonable limits, recognizing
that the primary purpose of streets is for traffic. Reasonable limits of the
use of streets for transportation of storm runoff shall be governed by the
below listed design criteria:
Â 
Street Classification          Maximum Encroachment
Hillside access/hillside local No curb overtopping. Flow may spread to crown.
Local road                     No curb overtopping. Flow spread must leave at
                               least 1 lane free of water.
                               No curb overtopping. Flow spread must leave 1
Minor collector                lane free of water in each direction (total, 2
                               lanes free of water).
Â 
When the above encroachment is exceeded, an independent stormwater system shall
be designed and constructed based on a 10-year storm.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The stormwater from a 100-year frequency storm shall be adequately
conveyed either within the limits of the street right of way or in storm drain
easements without creating flood hazards to dwellings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â When an underground pipe system is required, it shall be designed
to carry a 10-year storm. Major hydraulic structures shall be designed to carry
a 25-year storm. The minimum storm drain size shall be ten inches (10").
Â Â Â Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Unless specifically permitted, retention basins on hillsides shall
not be allowed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Detention shall be allowed where it is compatible with all required
reports. Detention basins shall be used for the purpose of eliminating the
effects of the peak runoff of storms and releasing water flow at the
preproject, or approved rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Cross gutter drains on streets shall be avoided wherever possible.
They shall not be allowed on collector and higher order streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Drainage plans must be consistent with all other reports, i.e.,
geotechnical, soils, landscaping, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â When springs or other groundwater sources are found on the
developer's property, the construction of an underground pipe system to
eliminate the nuisance of this water will be required. Minimum pipe size shall
be ten inches (10"). Overland flow will not be allowed for water that is
continuously present.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â All buildings shall be constructed outside the limits of and
eighteen inches (18") above the 100-year flood stage, except on drainages
subject to FEMA.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â Necessary measures shall be taken to prevent erosion and scour at
all points throughout the development. It shall be mitigated at all points of
discharge and at the face of any cut or fill slope throughout the development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â During grading or construction on any property (including off site
construction), the developer shall control both water used for construction and
storm runoff in such a manner as to not affect any adjoining properties, nor
add silt or debris to any existing storm drain, wash, channel or roadway.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Drainage Plan: The drainage plan shall be approved by the city engineer
prior to final plat approval and issuance of a building permit.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Drainage Report (Study): The drainage report shall be approved by the
city engineer prior to final plat approval and issuance of building permits.
The report shall be prepared in conformance with guidelines provided by the
city engineer.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Geology And Soils Report: Geologic hazard areas, including, but not
limited to, unstable soil, groundwater or springs, mining shafts, tunnels or
natural holes or caves, cliffs and other features which might pose a hazard to
residents now or at any time in the future will require investigation and a
report prepared by a licensed professional engineer trained and experienced in
the practice of geotechnical engineering, and shall contain at least the
following information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Slope stability analysis; conclusions and recommendations concerning
the effects of material removal, introduction of water, ground shaking, and
erosion on slope stability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Foundation investigation; conclusions and recommendations concerning
the effects of soil conditions on foundation and structural stability,
including bearing capacity, sheer strength and shrink/swell potential of soils.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The location and yield of springs and seeps which shall be shown on
the site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Structural features, including any geological limitations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Existence of surface hazards, including potential for rockfalls and
toppling failures to cliffs, slopes and overhangs above the subject property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of geologic
conditions on the proposed development, together with recommendations
identifying the means proposed to minimize any hazard to life or property, or
adverse impact on the natural environment. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Landscape And Vegetation Plan: Prior to final plat or site plan
approval of a project, a landscape plan, prepared by a licensed landscape
contractor or a landscape architect, in conjunction with the overall site plan,
must be submitted for approval. The plan shall outline areas being excavated
and filled and describe in detail how the developer will restore or replant
these areas. The plan shall specify types of retention being used, together
with sprinkler plans and water usage methods suitable to the soil of the
project.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Other Information: Other reports, plans and information as may be
deemed necessary by the hillside review board or city engineer may be requested
as a condition of the application procedures. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd.
2014 Code)
10-16A-9: STREET DESIGN:
The following standards apply to public and private streets:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street Grades: All street grades shall be a maximum of twelve percent
(12%). However, when conditions can be made more desirable by exceeding twelve
percent (12%) and produce less disturbance to the existing terrain, along with
improvement in safety features, the city engineer may allow grades to fifteen
percent (15%) based on the merits of each case.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Intersections: Where at all possible, all intersections shall be ninety
degree (90Â°) angles. In the event an acute angle intersection is required, it
can be mitigated by realigning to achieve a ninety degree (90Â°) intersection
using a fifty foot (50') section prior to the PC of the curve or a landing area
design in which a vehicle is brought ninety degrees (90Â°) to the intersecting
road. (See exhibit C attached to ordinance 2012.04, for example.) Acute angle
intersections will only be allowed at T-intersections.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Intersection Spacing: Intersections should be spaced far enough apart
so that the traffic stopped to make left turns at one intersection does not
interfere with traffic movements at the adjacent intersections. On low volume
streets, such as access road to subcollectors or subcollectors to
subcollectors, the minimum distance should be one hundred twenty five feet
(125'); for the subcollectors to collectors, the minimum distance should be two
hundred fifty feet (250'). (See exhibit C attached to ordinance 2012.04, for
example.)
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Design Speed: The design of geometric features, such as horizontal and
vertical alignment, will depend on the design speed selected for each street.
The design speed is primarily determined by the street function and
classification and is the maximum speed for safe and comfortable operation of a
vehicle. Other than a major collector, all streets in hillside areas are
classified as low speed streets (35 miles per hour or less). The use of design
speeds other than those listed must be approved by the city engineer, who may
decide that the speed provided in this subsection be reduced to that which is
reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and
potential hazards.
Â

Â Â Â Hillside local         251     251
Â Â Â Hillside access        251     251
Â 
Note:
Â Â Â Â Â Â  1. Â Â Â Variance of design speeds may be granted by the city engineer to
no greater than 5 miles per hour or less when conditions warrant. Variances
will not be granted for short segments of roads, but for entire contiguous
stretches so that consistency and driver expectancy are maintained.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Clear Sight Distance At Intersections: At intersections (see exhibit C
attached to ordinance 2012.04), adequate, clear sight distance should be
provided to permit drivers entering the higher order street to see approaching
traffic from a long enough distance to allow them to decide when to enter the
higher order street, turn onto the street and accelerate in advance of
approaching traffic. Clear sight distance should be in accordance with the
following table:
Â 
Posted Speed Of   Minimum Y1 Desired Y1

Â 
Â Â Â Note:
Â Â Â Â Â Â  1. Â Â Â See exhibit C attached to ordinance 2012.04.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Vertical Curves And Intersection Relationship: The vertical alignment
of residential streets should ensure that drivers can safely negotiate hills in
adverse weather and that sight distances are adequate for safety. The
requirements for vertical curve design shall be in accordance with latest
editions of AASHTO "Geometric Design Of Highways And Streets". See table below
for listing of pertinent design criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â MINIMUM LENGTH OF VERTICAL CURVES
Â

35           40              50
Â 
L = KA (for minimum sight distance on a vertical curve).
L = Length of vertical curve for proper sight distance.
A = Algebraic difference in grade.
Vertical alignment with the intersection is also of special nature, and design
alternatives may be required. As a guideline, the approach area where vehicles
stop while waiting to enter an intersection shall not exceed four (4) to five
percent (5%) from the gutter line of the street being intersected for a
distance of fifty feet (50'), though a range of fifty feet (50') to one hundred
feet (100') is more desirable. This applies to all intersections, except those
intersections where both intersecting streets are minor collectors. The landing
area for a minor collector shall be designed for a grade of two (2) to three
percent (3%) for a distance of one hundred feet (100').
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Safe Stopping Sight Distance: The minimum sight distance to be provided
before a stop is required shall comply with the requirements set forth in the
table below:

financial guarantee shall be provided in an amount sufficient to ensure
necessary soil stabilization, including grading, planting and maintenance, in
the event the developer fails to complete the hillside restoration in
accordance with the approved plan within one year from the issuance of the
permit; provided, that the Planning Commission may grant such time extension as
may be necessary to allow completion of the restoration work in the event
significant progress toward completion of the project is underway.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Amount: The performance bond or letter of credit shall cover the cost,
as estimated by the City Engineer, to restore the hillside to an acceptable
level of appearance and stability. In case of a dispute over what constitutes
an acceptable level of restoration, the decision of the Planning Commission
shall be determinative. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-16A-12: APPEALS:

must pass a fire inspection. The Fire inspection shall be scheduled with the
Hurricane Valley Fire District and be performed within forty-five (45) days of
submitting a complete application. Zoning Administrator may extend the deadline
to complete the fire inspection based on inspector availability. Failure to do
so will result in the denial of the Nightly Rental License application and the
license will become available to the next applicant on the waiting list.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â All structures on the property that are used for nightly rental
purposes must have a Certificate of Occupancy. An application will not be
considered compelte without a Certificate of Occupancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Notification: Applicant must pay for and provide notification to
neighboring property owners within three hundred feet (300') from all exterior
boundaries of the lot on which the nightly rental is to be located. This notice
shall indicate, and the Cityâ€™s Planning Commission shall conduct, a public
hearing on the application. To comply with this requirement the applicant must
submit self-addressed, stamped envelopes for the required notification along
with a printed list of the lot owners in the designated notification area.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nightly Rental License Application Review Process: A complete Nightly
Rental License application will be reviewed by City staff at the next regularly
scheduled City staff meeting. City staff shall review the application and
forward their recommendation to the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission will hear the application at their next regularly scheduled meeting
where adequate notice is appropriate and conduct a public hearing on the same.
After said public hearing the Planning Commission will forward their
recommendation to the City Council for a final determination on the Nightly
Rental License application. The City Council may deny, approve or approve with
special conditions the Nightly Rental License application.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â One Structure: Each nightly rental must occur within and under one roof
of a dwelling and not in a structure that is temporary. Accessory structures
can create multi-family zoning and shall not be used as nightly rentals. More
specifically, a detached casita, garage, workshop, mother-in-law building, etc.
cannot be used exclusively as a nightly rental without the simultaneous use of
part or all of the dwelling as well.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Parking: A minimum of four (4) nine feet by 18 feet (9' x 18') parking
spaces are required. Two of those spaces must be available exclusively for
nightly rental use. There shall be no overnight on-street parking by guests or
residents.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Maximum Guests: The maximum number of occupants per dwelling being used
for nightly rental shall be the lesser of ten (10) (including the owner and

manager/emergency contact shall respond to complaints and/or concerns within
thirty (30) minutes of any phone call or other notification and be on site
within one (1) hour if necessary. Failure of the owner or property manager to
respond may result in a violation and possible fines to the business license
holder and property owner.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Nightly Rental Ownership Limitation: Neither a natural person applicant
nor a principal of a business entity applying for a Nightly Rental License
shall have an ownership interest in more than one (1) dwelling wherein nightly
rentals occur within the City. One person residing in the same dwelling shall
not have ownership interest in more than one (1) dwelling wherein nightly
rentals occur within the City.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Limit on Total number of Nightly Rental Licenses:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The maximum number of nightly rental business licenses issued will
be set at five percent (5%) of the total number of â€œEligible Culinary
Connectionsâ€ within Toquerville City limits. For purposes of this Subsection,
the term â€œEligible Culinary Connectionsâ€ is defined as all residential culinary
connections within the City except for those residential culinary connections
located within a development in an MPDO Zone where the developer has elected to
allow a Nightly Rental Development in their commercial planning areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The total number of Nightly Rental Licenses available shall be
continually updated as the number of new culinary connections increase.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Once the maximum number of Nightly Rental Licenses have been issued,
any new application that meets all of the application requirements shall be
placed on a waiting list in order of the date of receipt. The waiting list
shall be capped at ten (10) applications. No fees will be due until a license
becomes available. When a license becomes available, the first applicant on the
waiting list shall be notified of the license availability. From the date of
notification, the applicant shall have fifteen (15) days to resubmit a complete
application and pay the required application fee. The applicant must complete
the licensing process within sixty (60) days thereafter. If the applicant fails
to resubmit a complete application within fifteen (15) days, or fails to
complete the licensing process within sixty (60) days, the application will be
deemed expired. The next applicant will then be notified of the license
availability and shall then follow the same procedure.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Minimum Distance: Properties used for nightly rentals shall have a
minimum separation of five hundred feet (500'). This will be measured in a
straight line from the closest point of one nightly rental Dwelling to the
closest point of the other.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Dwelling Modifications: Any modifications to the appearance and size of
a Dwelling to accommodate and facilitate a nightly rental should be in keeping
with the residential character of the neighborhood within which the Dwelling is
located.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Penalties: Upon finding a violation under this Chapter and Section, the
following penalties and requirements shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â First Violation: Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00).

Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Review: Upon the second or subsequent violation of this Section,
there shall be a mandatory review conducted before the Cityâ€™s Planning
Commission, who shall have the ability and right to revoke the Nightly Rental
License in its sole and absolute discretion. Revocation of a Nightly Rental
License, for any reason shall result in a minimum twelve (12) month waiting
period before any new application. Revocation shall run with the land. Upon
revocation, there is no guarantee of any future issuance of a Nightly Rental
License and all applications will be processed under the then current
ordinances. Failure to pay the fine within thirty (30) days of its issuance
shall constitute grounds for automatic revocation of the ownerâ€™s Nightly Rental
License.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Enforcement: In addition to the fines set forth in this subsection,
all violations of this chapter and section may constitute a misdemeanor as per
1-4-1 of the Toquerville City Code and may be enforced in compliance with
Chapter 5 of this Title.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Revocation of License: The Nightly Rental License may be revoked at any
time, upon notice and a hearing conducted by the Planning Commission, should

ARTICLE B. TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION:
10-19B-1: Scope
10-19B-2: Simple Subdivision
10-19B-3: Conventional Subdivision
10-19B-4: Phased Subdivisions
10-19B-1: SCOPE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivisions of land shall be divided, subdivided, reconfigured,
developed or redeveloped in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, and
other applicable provisions of this Title, the state land sales practices act,
the City General Plan, and all other applicable City resolutions and ordinances
and Utah Code Annotated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Specific procedures for each type of subdivision are outlined in
Articles of this Chapter as noted in this Article. General subdivision
procedures are outlined in Article C of this Chapter. General design
regulations are outlined in Article D of this Chapter. Procedures for simple
subdivisions, lot and parcel splits, master planned developments and phased
subdivisions have additional requirements and/or relaxed requirements as
outlined in this Chapter. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2024.22, 11-20-
2024)
10-19B-2: SIMPLE SUBDIVISION:
The intent of this simple subdivision process is to take advantage of the Utah
State Code exemption to allow for a subdivision with no more than three (3) or
fewer lots to be processed in a shorter time frame as a simple subdivision.
This code outlines a separate process for a simple subdivision with three (3)
or fewer lots. In this process, an applicant may elect to divide property
through a metes and bounds record of survey. See Article E of this Chapter for
the approval process and required improvements. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd.
Ord. 2024.22, 11-20-2024)
10-19B-3: CONVENTIONAL SUBDIVISION:
The purpose and intent of the conventional subdivision procedure is to allow
the division of land in all zones in a standard and more traditional
configuration of lots. While creative and innovative land development is
encouraged, the conventional subdivision may be best suited for smaller acreage
subdivisions and/or tract developments. See Article C of this Chapter for
approval process and Article D of this Chapter for required improvements. (Ord.
2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord. 2024.22, 11-20-2024)
10-19B-4: PHASED SUBDIVISIONS:
Conventional and master planned developments may be phased subdivisions if the
project is proposed to be completed in designated phases. The purpose of the
phased subdivision procedure is to provide general development parameters for
subdivision phases in the phased subdivision master plan prior to the detailed
and comprehensive requirements of the preliminary plat and final plat. The
developer and/or owner shall enter into a development agreement (see section
10-19C-5) that outlines the duties, responsibilities, obligations, commitments
and promises of the City and the owner and developer. See Article C of this
Chapter for the approval process, Article D of this Chapter for required
improvements, and Chapter 21 of this Title, general design standards, for
additional standards and requirements. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord.
2024.22, 11-20-2024)

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The Preliminary Administrative Land Use Authority shall deny the
application if the applicant is unwilling to make the required corrections or
provide the required information.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In instances where a developer abandons or otherwise fails to take
timely actions to address corrections or complete a project, the application
approval shall lapse.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A Preliminary Plat application expires if it is not approved by
the City within six (6) months from the time its application is submitted and

expiration of the Preliminary Plat application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A preliminary subdivision plat approval shall remain valid for
six (6) months from the date of approval. If a final subdivision plat is not
applied for within six (6) months of the date of the preliminary approval, the
preliminary plat shall be void, unless a one-time extension of six (6) months

protection, safety, and any other issues related.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Any Water Conveyance Facility shall have at least twenty (20)
calendar days to respond. While the City may provide comments to the applicant
before this twenty (20) day window is complete, the Final Administrative Land

Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Within the review window in Subsection 5, the City shall complete a
review of the Final Plat, Subdivision Improvement Plans, and submittal contents
and provide a response to the applicant. The City shall determine whether the
application meets all requirements or requires corrective action and shall
notify the applicant in a written response.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â If the application is found to require corrections, the City must

modifications or additions. The required corrections are sent to the applicant
to prepare a resubmittal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The City may require additional information relating to an
applicant's plans to ensure compliance with municipal ordinances and approved
standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â If the applicant is found to meet all codes, standards, and
specifications, the application is forwarded to the Final Administrative Land
Use Authority for review and approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â If corrections are required, the applicant shall provide a
resubmittal. The resubmittal shall include a written explanation in response to
each of the municipality's review comments, identifying and explaining the

Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The City shall check the resubmittal to ensure that the applicant
has responded to each item logged in the index of requested modifications or
additions. If the response does not address each item, the City shall return
the submittal to the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â If the resubmittal is complete, the City shall accept the
application for a second review cycle. The time frame to complete the review
depends on how quickly the applicant responded to the corrections in full and
whether the applicant made any material changes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the applicant responds within forty (40) business days,
the City has forty (40) business days to complete the second review cycle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the applicant responds after forty (40) business days, the
City has sixty (60) business days to complete the second review cycle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the applicant made a material change that merits a new
review, the review shall restart at the first review cycle as it relates to the
new material.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â If the City neglects to include a required change or correction in
the initial review process, the modification or correction can only be imposed
on subsequent reviews if necessary to protect public health and safety or to

applicant. This shall be provided to the applicant up until the fourth review
cycle, at which point the application shall be forwarded to the Final
Administrative Land Use Authority for review with a recommendation that the
application does not meet all codes, standards, and specifications. The
applicant may appeal this determination as outlined in Utah Code 10-9a-604.2
(8), as amended.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â If, on the fourth and final review, the City fails to respond

owner, and within ten (10) business days after the day on which the request is

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: The streetscape buffer is intended to provide an area of
landscaped open space along all public streets which form the perimeter of the
subdivision where front yards of homes do not front the street and on all
public streets within the subdivision where front yards of homes do not front
the street. The intent is to provide the general public using the public
streets with a more open view of the scenic vistas prominent in the community
and a less congested experience as they travel along the public streets within
the community. It is further the intent to provide a common and consistent
appearance of all public streets within the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Maintenance By Homeowners' Association: Streetscape landscaping shall
be maintained by a homeowners' association. The developer shall note on the

streets less than sixty feet (60') wide.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Uneven, creative streetscape buffer areas with varied setbacks and
wall heights are preferred.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Stepped and staggered buffer walls may be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Serpentine sidewalks, which are encouraged, may be located within
the buffer area.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Design Approval Required: All landscaping, fencing and sidewalks shall
be approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. Ord.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: Fencing may be used to provide privacy to property owners,
buffer conflicting uses or to provide a architectural/design element to a
development project. Fencing is encouraged to be as low profile and open as
possible to protect scenic vistas from public streets and discourage separation
from the community. The materials, location, height and all elements of fencing
shall comply with the design guidelines.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â General Requirements: Any permanent fencing shall be incorporated into
the development design and implemented by the developer in compliance with any
other applicable ordinances and meet the following general requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All fencing designed and installed by the developer shall be

the intent of this process to allow a developer and the City to master plan
large scale, multiphased developments and proceed with the development
approval, as well as the actual construction on a phased basis over a period of
years. After approval of the phased subdivision master plan, a preliminary plan
and final plat, as required in Article C of this Chapter, must be approved
prior to development of the subdivision. Required improvements are outlined in
Article D of this Chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All details, obligations and requirements of the phased subdivision
master plan shall be contained in a development agreement. The development
agreement shall include all obligations of the developer/owner and conceptual
development approvals for future phases. All subdivision requirements and
development standards shall be imposed as part of detailed reviews and
approvals of the subdivision preliminary plan and final plat. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-

10-20-1: PURPOSE:
Although each zoning district is primarily intended for a predominant type of
use (i.e., dwelling units in Residential Districts), there are a number of uses
which the City Council has identified that may be appropriate in a particular
district if conditions are met that mitigate potential adverse impacts of the
proposed use. For example, as a condition of approval, the traffic that would
be generated by a proposed use may be offset by improvements to an adjacent
intersection to increase its traffic capacity. The conditional use review is
intended to provide additional information necessary to assure compatibility
and harmonious relationships between proposed uses, surrounding properties and
the City at large. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-20-2: APPROVAL REQUIRED:
Conditional use approval is required for the conditional uses in each zone.
Conditional use approval may be revoked upon failure to comply with all
conditions attached to the original approval of the conditional use as set
forth in a conditional use permit. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-20-3: REVIEW PROCESS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application: An application for approval of a conditional use shall be
filed with the Planning Department on a form provided by the City, and must

application. Members of the public may submit written comments to be part of
the public hearing record or may present oral comments at the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â With receipt of input from appropriate City departments or
officials, and input from any public hearing, the Planning Commission shall
review the project and make a preliminary determination regarding the
conditional use application and any conditions of approval. The Planning
Commission will forward to the City Council a recommendation to grant, to grant
with conditions or to deny the conditional use application.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â City Council Action: After receiving the Planning Commission
recommendation regarding a conditional use application, the City Council will
consider the conditional use application and the recommendations of the
Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The City Council
may grant, grant with conditions or deny any application for a conditional use
permit. (Ord. 2019.03, 5-9-2019)

10-21A-1: INTRODUCTION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Commercial developments will occupy dominant locations within
Toquerville and serve essential community commerce needs at different levels,
from neighborhood to region-wide. The design of commercial spaces reflects the
communityâ€™s character. The care and attention paid to the design of commercial
projects exhibits the Cityâ€™s pride in itself and contributes to its socio-
economic vitality.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The following guidelines provide design concepts and direction for all
commercial projects, encourage high quality and innovative design solutions and
recognize the importance of storefront visibility as well as parking and
circulation design to the success of commercial enterprises. The guidelines
that implement the Design Principles set forth are intended to foster
developments which would be in keeping with the overall character of
Toquerville.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Site-specific standards shall take precedence when in conflict with the
guidelines. Where such standards are silent, these guidelines will serve as a
supplement. Toquerville City Ordinance Title 9 Building Regulations and Title
10 Land Use Regulations should be consulted for specific regulations governing
land use and zoning development standards.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â These Design Standards apply to Neighborhood Commercial Districts,
Highway Commercial, Planned Commercial Zones as defined in Chapter 12 of this
Title and Commercial Planning Areas within a Master Planned Development Overlay
(MPDO) Development as defined in Article C, Chapter 15 of this Title.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All new commercial development shall be reviewed by the City Staff for
compliance with these Design Standards. (Ord. 2020.16, 9-10-2020; amd. Ord.

topographical areas such as ridgelines, unique hillside features and creeks is
prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Innovative grading concepts such as contour grading, that
incorporate use of variable slopes and meandering tops and toes of slopes
techniques are encouraged. Smooth, gradual transitions between manufactured and
natural slopes are recommended.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Use of retaining walls shall be minimized. Where use of retaining
walls cannot be avoided, they shall be screened to the maximum extent possible
and use of plantable retaining walls systems should be employed as part of the
design solution.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Compatibility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Project design shall complement the surrounding built environment in

                        The unit used to quantify the amount of light energy
LUMEN:                  produced by a lamp at the lamp. Lumen output of most
                        lamps is listed on the packaging.
                        A complete lighting unit, consisting of a lamp or
                        lamps, together with the parts designed to distribute
LUMINAIRE:              the light, to position and protect the lamps and to
                        connect the lamps to the power. When used, includes
                        ballasts and photocells. Commonly referred to as
                        "fixture".
                        At a point and in a given direction, the luminous
                        intensity in the given direction produced by an element
                        of the surface surrounding the point divided by the
                        area of the projection of the element on a plane
LUMINANCE:              perpendicular to the given direction. Units: Candelas
                        per unit area. The luminance is the perceived
                        brightness that we see the visual effect of the
                        luminance, reflected, emitted or transmitted from a
                        surface.
               The condition that occurs after two hundred (200) hours of lamp use
MAINTAINED     prior to a point where luminaire cleaning is necessary. Measurements
ILLUMINANCE:   are taken at ground level with sensor parallel to the ground for
               horizontal luminance and measured at five feet (5â€™) above ground with
               sensor perpendicular to the ground for vertical luminance.
               The effect of a part or parts of a luminaire that provides a barrier
OPAQUE:        above and in some cases around the lamp, that does not allow any light
               to pass through.
PARTIALLY      The luminaire incorporates a translucent barrier, the "partial shield"
SHIELDED:      around the lamp that allows some light to pass through the barrier of
               the fixture's walls while concealing the lamp from the viewer.

ZONING         The Toquerville City planning and zoning administrator.
ADMINISTRATOR:
               When a light is built into a structure or portion of a structure such
RECESSED:      that the light is fully cut off and no part of the light extends or
               protrudes beyond the underside of a structure or portion of a
               structure.
               When the light emitted from the fixture is projected below a horizontal
               plane running through the lowest point of the fixture where light is
SHIELDED:      emitted. The bulb is not visible with a shielded light fixture, and no
               light is emitted from the sides of the fixture. Also considered a full
               cutoff fixture.
               The overhead glow from light emitted sideways and upward. Sky glow is
SKY GLOW:      caused by the reflection and scattering of light by dust, water vapor
               and other particles suspended in the atmosphere.
TEMPORARY      Lighting that is intended to be used for a special event for seven (7)
LIGHTING:      days or less, and temporary construction lighting.
               The effect of a part or parts of a luminaire that provides a barrier
TRANSLUCENT:   around the lamp that allows some light to pass through the barrier in a
               diffused manner, such that the lamp cannot be clearly distinguished.
UNSHIELDED:    The luminaires only incorporate clear glass, which permits all light to
               escape.
Â 
UPLIGHTING: Fully shielded lighting that is directed in such a manner as to
            shine light rays above the horizontal plane.

prescribed by this chapter. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
10-25-8: EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU):
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Established: There is established for the purposes of calculating the
stormwater user fees the equivalent residential unit (ERU) as a method of
measurement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Defined: The ERU is the average of the total square footage of the
impervious surface areas of developed single-family residential property with
the city, as approved by the city council.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Setting ERU: The ERU shall be set by the city council in the fee
schedule as adopted by the city council.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Source Of ERU: The city council shall have the discretion to determine
the source of the data from which the ERU is established, taking into
consideration the general acceptance and use of such source on the part of
other stormwater systems, and the reliability and general accuracy of the
source, including, but not limited to, the property tax assessor's rolls, site
examination, mapping information, aerial photographs and other reliable
information.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Evaluation Of ERU: The ERU shall be evaluated by the stormwater utility
as necessary, but the ERU shall be evaluated at least every five (5) years.
(Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-25-9: PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORMWATER USER FEES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Property Classifications: For the purposes of determining the
stormwater user fee, all properties in the city are classified into one of the
following categories:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Single-family residential property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other developed property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Vacant/undeveloped property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Agricultural property; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Exempt property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Single-Family Residential Fee: The city council finds that the
intensity of development of most parcels of real property in the city
classified as single-family residential is similar and that it would be
excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square
footage of the impervious surface of each parcel. Therefore, all single-family
residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat stormwater user fee,
equal to the ERU base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the
impervious surface area of the improvements, except as provided herein. Single-
family residential property in which the impervious surface exceeds twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet, including any detached accessory structures,
shall be charged the same as the fee for other developed property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Other Developed Property Fee: The fee for other developed property
(i.e., nonsingle-family residential) in the city shall be the base rate
multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious
area (square feet) of the property by one ERU. The minimum stormwater user fee
for other developed property shall equal the base rate for single-family
residential property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Vacant/Undeveloped Property Fee: The fee for vacant/undeveloped
property shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the property contains less than one thousand eight hundred
(1,800) square feet of impervious surface, then no stormwater user fee shall be
charged;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the property contains one thousand eight hundred (1,800) square
feet or more of impervious surface, then the property shall be charged based on
the amount of impervious surface as other developed property, with the minimum
charge being the single-family residential fee.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Agricultural Property: The fee for agricultural property shall be as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the property contains impervious surface in an amount equal to or
less than the average ERU, then the minimum stormwater user fee for such
property shall be the base rate for a single-family residential property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the property contains impervious surface in an amount greater
than the average ERU, then the property shall be charged in the same manner as
other developed property.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Exempt Property: There shall be no stormwater user fee for exempt
property or as otherwise provided by state law. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-25-10: BASE RATE:
The city council shall, in the fee schedule as adopted, establish the base rate
for the ERU. The base rate shall be calculated to ensure adequate revenues to
fund the costs of stormwater management and to provide for the operation,
maintenance and capital improvements of the stormwater system in the city.
(Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
10-25-11: PROPERTY OWNERS TO PAY CHARGES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The owner of each property shall be obligated to pay the stormwater
user fee as provided in this chapter; provided, however, that if no water or
sewer service is being provided at the property to the owner as a customer of
record and such service is being provided to a customer of record other than
the owner, it shall be presumed that the owner and such customer of record have
agreed that the customer of record shall be obligated to pay such stormwater
user fee. If the customer of record other than the owner refuses to pay the
stormwater user fee, the owner of each parcel shall be obligated to pay the
"stormwater user fee", as defined in section
10-25-3 of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nonresidential multi-tenant properties shall be billed according to the
placement of utility meters, i.e., if the property contains individual unit
meters, then billing for the stormwater user fee shall be billed to individual
units based on the unit's pro rata percentage of impervious surface. If the
multi-tenant property contains a master meter, then the stormwater user fee for
the entire impervious surface area shall be billed to the customer of record
for such master meter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Each unit of a multi-tenant residential building shall be billed a
minimum charge, the same being the single-family residential fee, to the
customer of record for the unit. If an individual unit is not individually
billed for any water or sewer service and is master metered, then the customer
of record for the master meter shall be billed as other developed property
based on the total impervious surface area. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-25-12: BILLING PROCEDURES AND PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Rate And Collection Schedule: The stormwater user fee shall be billed
and collected monthly with the monthly utility services bill for those
properties within the corporate limits. The stormwater user fee for those
properties utilizing city utilities is part of a consolidated statement for
utility customers, which is generally paid by a single payment to the city. All
bills for the stormwater user fee shall become due and payable in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the city.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Delinquent Bills: The stormwater user fee shall be considered
delinquent if not received by the city by the due date stated in the utility
statement and subsequent late fees shall be imposed as set forth in the fee
schedule adopted by the city. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Penalty For Late Payment; Failure To Pay: Stormwater user fees shall be
subject to a late fee established by the city council. The city shall be
entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in collecting delinquent stormwater
user fees. The city may discontinue utility service to any stormwater user who
fails or refuses to pay the stormwater user fees and may refuse to accept
payment of the utility bill from any user without receiving at the same time,
payment of the stormwater user fee charges owed by such user and further may
refuse to reestablish service until all such fees have been paid in full. (Ord.
2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
10-25-13: APPEAL OF FEES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person who disagrees with the calculation of the stormwater user
fee, as provided in this chapter, may appeal such fee determination to the city
council within ten (10) days after the date the payment is due. Any appeal not
filed within the time permitted by this section shall be deemed waived.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All appeals shall be filed in writing and addressed to the mayor and
shall state the grounds for the appeal and the amount of stormwater user fee
the appellant asserts is appropriate.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The appeal shall provide such information and documentation supporting
the basis of the appeal.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The city council shall review the appeal and determine whether the
challenged determination is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
Appeals related to the stormwater user fee shall be decided based on
substantiated evidence with a sound engineering and factual basis. All appeal
determinations shall be applied utilizing a strict interpretation of this
chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The decision of the city council shall be final and conclusive.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â If a refund is due, the mayor shall authorize the refund which will be
provided as a credit against the customer's stormwater user fee billings until
such credit is exhausted. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)

not be subsequently used without meeting the requirements of this chapter. No
preexisting system shall be altered in any manner that would increase the
degree of nonconformity with the requirements of this chapter and no
alterations shall be made to a nonconforming preexisting system during its life
which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value. If such system is
destroyed or damaged to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its fair
market value at the time of destruction or damage, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with this chapter. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-26-3: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the following
meanings, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
SHADOW FLICKER: Alternating changes in light intensity caused by the moving
blade of a wind energy system casting shadows on an object, such as a window.
TOTAL EXTENDED HEIGHT: The distance measured from ground level to the tip of
the blade, extended at its highest point of travel.
TOWER: The supporting structure on which the turbine is mounted.
TURBINE: That portion of the wind system that is used to capture the energy of
the wind and transform it into electrical or mechanical energy. The turbine
includes a rotor (blades) and nacelle (generator), and on many wind systems a
tail.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, LARGE: A wind energy conversion system consisting of one or
more wind turbines and towers, with associated control or conversion
electronics, which will be used for on site and/or off site consumption of
power with a rated capacity in excess of one hundred (100) kW.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, SMALL: A wind energy conversion system consisting of one or
more wind turbines, a tower or other support structure, and associated control
or conversion electronics with a rated capacity appropriate to the on site
electric usage of the end use and which will be used primarily to reduce on
site consumption of utility power. A small wind energy system may have a rated
capacity of up to one hundred (100) kW.
WIND MONITORING TOWER AND EQUIPMENT - METEOROLOGICAL (MET) TOWER: A tower that
houses or supports wind measuring equipment, such as an anemometer, for the
purpose of measuring and monitoring wind velocity, duration, intensity,
regularity, air temperature and pressure, etc. MET towers are typically
permitted only on a temporary basis (2 to 5 years) to help determine the
viability of a wind energy system project; although more permanent MET towers
may also be considered.
WIND TURBINE, HORIZONTAL - AXIS (HAWT): A wind turbine designed to have the
axis of rotation aligned with the direction of the wind, such as with the
common propeller type models. These turbines have a rotor revolving about a
horizontal axis. They look like a small airplane with a large propeller and no
wings, and are the most common variety.
WIND TURBINE, VERTICAL - AXIS (VAWT): A wind turbine designed to have the axis
of rotation perpendicular to the wind direction. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
10-26-4: SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permitted Locations And Number: A small wind energy system that
complies with the provisions of this section is permitted only as described in
this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum Lot Size: A horizontal axis small wind energy system may only
be erected on a lot that is capable of meeting the setback requirements of this
section. A vertical axis small wind energy system, whether mounted vertically
or horizontally, may be erected on a lot that is capable of meeting the setback
requirements of this section. The fall zone limits the lot size requirement so
the tower will not cross the property line of the property in which it is
erected in the event the tower falls or collapses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Design Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pole Or Tower Design: The design of the small wind energy system may
include a monopole/freestanding design, or a guywired tower, whether mounted on
the ground or on a building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Total Extended Height: The total extended height of the small wind
energy system shall not exceed thirty five feet (35'). Otherwise, exceptions to
the height limitations are subject to approval by the land use authority as a
conditional use permit pursuant to chapter 20 of this title. Sufficient
clearance to lower and raise the tower and turbine is to be provided and
maintained.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Safety:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The minimum height of the lowest extent of a turbine blade/rotor
shall be twenty feet (20') above the ground, if on a horizontal axis turbine.
There is no minimum rotor height for a vertical axis turbine, provided the
blades/rotor must be located or isolated (e.g., fenced) such that they are not
easily accessible to anyone but maintenance personnel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â No tower shall have an external climbing apparatus within twelve
feet (12') of the ground. All access doors or accessways to towers and
electrical equipment shall be locked when not in use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Appropriate warning signage/marking is to be placed on towers,
guywires and electrical equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â All small wind energy systems must have a manufacturer's maximum
RPM (revolutions per minute) rating of less than five hundred (500).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Small wind turbines that are operating erratically shall be shut
down and/or lowered to the ground. Examples of erratic operation include, but
are not limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Unusual noises such as those indicating failure of bearings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Unusual vibrations such as those indicating that the rotor is
out of balance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Falling or loosely hanging parts, such as tail vanes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Setbacks:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â In determining the required separation of a small wind energy
system from the uses listed, all applicable setbacks are to be followed. Where
multiple setbacks are applicable, the most restrictive applies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â For safety purposes, a small wind energy system shall be set back
from the nearest property line, public road right of way, tanks containing
combustible/flammable liquids, and aboveground communication or electrical
lines not less than 1.1 times its total extended height if located on a
freestanding tower or pole, or if mounted on a building, the distance of the
likely fall zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Additional setbacks from neighboring residences and residentially
zoned lots are set forth in subsection C5 of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Noise Limitations And Additional Setbacks: To reduce noise impacts
to neighboring residential properties, no small wind energy system or
combination of small wind energy systems shall produce noise that exceeds fifty
(50) dBA, as measured at the property line of any neighboring residentially
zoned lot not owned by the small wind energy system developer. (Note: Public
road right of way counts toward the setback.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Separation Of Multiple Systems: If more than one small wind
energy system is proposed and the setback from a neighboring residence or
residential property line is applicable, professional documentation (e.g., a
noise study) shall be submitted indicating that the above noise limitations
will be met. A situation with multiple small wind energy systems must consider
the effects of combined noise levels (may add up to 3 dB) and the appropriate
sound propagation calculations (whether line source properties apply to the
situation).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Single Systems: To establish the minimum setback necessary to
comply with the above noise limitations in situations of single wind energy
systems, the applicant shall provide from a reliable source the noise emission
level (a.k.a., noise rating) of the system, as measured at a specified distance
from the rotor or tower and at a given wind speed (e.g., 52 decibels at 100
feet from the tower, 30 miles per hour wind). Any noise rating must be based on
at least a ten (10) m/s (22.3 miles per hour) wind speed to qualify for use. If
the proposed setback is at least as far as the distance used for the noise
rating, and the noise rating is less than the above noise limits, then no
further calculations are necessary. Otherwise, the following calculations can
be utilized to determine if the proposed setback is sufficient to comply with
the above noise limits:
Step 1: Calculate the difference in decibels (dB) that would occur at the
neighboring residential property line and/or residence, as applicable, versus
the noise level at the distance used for the noise rating statement.
Equation: dB difference = 20 x logic, of (distance A / distance B)
Where "distance A" is the distance from the system used to establish the noise
rating, and "distance B" is the proposed distance between the wind energy
system and the neighboring residential property line and/or residence. Logic
stands for logarithm to the base-10. (Note: Simplified calculators are
available on the internet. The above equation is based on the general rule that
sound in the clearly audible frequency range will reduce 6 dB for every
doubling of distance from the source, assuming a single source of sound.)
Step 2: The result of the above equation is a negative number, which represents
the reduction in decibels from distance A to distance B. Subtract the absolute
value (positive equivalent) of that number from the noise rating of the system
and compare the answer to the applicable maximum allowable noise level (50
dBA). If the result is less than the maximum allowable noise level, the
proposed location is acceptable, provided all other applicable setbacks are
met.
In situations where a noise rating is not available on a specific model, the
city may either require a noise study to be performed by a qualified
professional, or make a conservative estimate based on a wind energy system of
similar characteristics (blade type and size, RPM speed, rated output, rotor
diameter, startup speed, etc.) plus a safety factor of three (3) dB to
establish the required setback.
Compliance with the setbacks established through the above equation shall be
deemed sufficient to comply with the noise limitations of this subsection for
permitting and enforcement purposes; provided, failure of the system to operate
at or below the rated noise emission level due to worn, damaged or broken
parts, shall constitute noncompliance and the system shall be shut down until
repairs are made to bring the system back into compliance. High wind
occurrences may result in noise levels above that calculated, as the noise
ratings are based on high, but not extreme wind speeds. Noise resulting from
such high wind occurrences does not constitute noncompliance with this section.
(Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
If the noise rating is based on one hundred feet (100') from the source, the
following table may be used for quick reference. If the noise rating is based
on fifty feet (50') from the source, simply subtract six (6) dB from the noise
rating and follow the row across to find the setback equivalents. If the noise
rating is based on some other distance, use the equation above. (Note: The
following table is not applicable to situations with multiple small wind energy
systems or to large wind energy systems.)

Â Â Â (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Visual Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Small wind energy systems are to be finished and maintained as
manufactured.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â No small wind energy system shall be lighted unless required by
the federal aviation administration (FAA). When lighting is required by the
FAA, it shall be the red, intermittent, glowing style, rather than the white,
strobe style, unless disclosed and justified through the application review
process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â No advertising signs of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be
permitted on any small wind energy system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The design of any accessory buildings or related structures
shall, to the extent reasonably possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend the facility into the natural setting
and existing environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The property owner shall reasonably attempt to site the system at
a location that minimizes the potential for shadow flicker impacts to their own
and neighboring residences.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Electrical Interconnections: All electrical interconnection or
distribution lines shall be underground and comply with all applicable codes
and public utility requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Signal Interference: Efforts shall be made to site small wind energy
systems to reduce the likelihood of blocking or reflecting television and other
communication signals. If signal interference occurs, both the small wind
energy system owner and individual receiving interference shall make reasonable
efforts to resolve the problem. No small wind energy system shall cause
permanent and material interference with television or other communication
signals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Overspeed Controls: Every small wind energy system is to be equipped
with an automatic overspeed control, braking system or feathering system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Small wind turbines must have some positive means of shutdown.
Examples of acceptable means for shutting the turbine down include, but are not
limited to, dynamic braking (usually accomplished by shorting the alternator
phases together); mechanical brakes that slow and then lock the rotor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Small wind turbines must have some means of controlling the
rotational speed of the turbine rotor in high winds. Examples of acceptable
means of control include, but are not limited to, furling mechanically forced
yawing, and blade pitch control. VAWT type small wind turbines, which cannot
use the above controls, must still incorporate some other means, such as
braking.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Fire Protection: All small wind energy systems are to be provided
with a defensible space for fire protection, in accordance with the city
building codes.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Permit Applications: A building permit is required for a small wind
energy system. The application is to include the following information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Site Plan: A site plan, drawn to scale, showing the location of the
proposed small wind energy system; the locations of all existing buildings and
structures, dimensioned to the property lines; the location of any septic
system, well, utility line or easement, access easement, or any tank containing
flammable materials on the property; the area required for raising and lowering
the tower; the defensible space area required by the international building
code; and the applicable setbacks for the small wind energy system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Noise Compliance Documentation: Provide the information necessary to
demonstrate that the applicable noise requirements of subsection C5 of this
section will be met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Standard Drawings: Engineered plans and calculations shall be
required to obtain a building permit for a small wind energy system. Plans and
calculations shall be stamped, dated and signed in accordance with state codes,
ordinances and laws governing such actions, by an engineer licensed and in good
standing with the state. Plans and calculations must verify that the structure
is designed and capable of withstanding the conditions of the site, including,
but not limited to, wind load, snow load, seismic conditions, and soil
conditions, as required by the building department. Soils testing by a
qualified soils engineer that is licensed by, and in good standing with, the
state may be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Specifications: Specific information on the type, model, size, rotor
material, rated power output, rated rotor speed, overspeed safety features and
survival wind speed, as well as the name and address of the manufacturer, is to
be provided. These items are typically included in a specification sheet
available from the manufacturer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Electrical Components: A line drawing of the electrical components
of the system in sufficient detail to establish that the installation conforms
to all applicable electrical codes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Net Metering Agreement: If the system will be connected to the
electricity grid, the applicant must provide documentation with the building
permit that the required net metering agreement is being considered by the
utility company (e.g., work order number status). The fully executed net
metering agreement must be provided to the building inspector prior to
operation of a system that will be connected to the grid. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-
2012)
10-26-5: LARGE WIND ENERGY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The following standards shall apply to all large wind energy systems: (Ord.
2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permitted: A large wind energy system may be permitted as described in
this title. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Design Standards: A large wind energy system shall comply with the
design standards set forth below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pole Or Tower Design: The design of the large wind energy system
shall be of monopole or freestanding design with no guywired towers. No open
lattice style towers are permitted, unless they are entirely clad with a
suitable cover, such as an architectural fabric, and engineered to consider the
additional forces related to the covering.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Minimum Blade Height: The minimum height of the lowest extent of a
turbine blade shall be thirty feet (30') above the ground and fifteen feet
(15') above any structure or obstacle within the fall zone of the tower.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Safety/Access:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â No tower shall have an exterior climbing apparatus within twelve
feet (12') of the ground. All access doors or accessways to towers and
electrical equipment shall be locked.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Appropriate warning signage shall be placed on towers, electrical
equipment and wind energy system entrances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Setbacks: In determining the required separation of a large wind
energy system from the uses listed, all applicable setbacks are to be followed.
Where multiple setbacks are applicable, the most restrictive applies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Project Boundary Lines: A commercial wind energy system tower
shall be set back from all project boundary lines, existing publicly maintained
roads, tanks containing combustible/flammable liquids and aboveground
communication or electrical lines, not less than 1.21 times its total extended
height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Other Uses: No large wind energy system shall be located within
one-half (1/2) mile of a park, church, hospital, school, playground or
residentially zoned lot not owned or leased by the wind energy developer.
Additional separation may be required to sufficiently mitigate noise and shadow
flicker resulting from the commercial wind energy system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Spacing: Large wind energy system towers shall be spaced on
center no closer than 1.1 times the total extended height.
Additional setbacks from neighboring residences and residentially zoned lots
are set forth in subsections B5 and B7e of this section for noise and shadow
flicker. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Noise:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Except when a professional noise study is submitted that properly
demonstrates that the noise thresholds specified below will not be exceeded
with a lesser setback, all large wind energy turbines shall be located a
minimum of 1.21 miles from all existing inhabitable structures (residences,
places of work, etc.) and residentially zoned lots that are not owned or leased
by the wind energy developer. Provided, in situations of mountainous topography
where the sound could be reflected/channeled toward a residential area, or when
the proposed wind turbines are rated more than 3.0 MW, the land use authority
may determine that a noise study is warranted to ensure sufficient setbacks to
meet the following noise thresholds. With the exception of such an instance,
compliance with the 1.21 miles setback shall be deemed sufficient to be in
compliance with the noise restrictions for large wind energy systems and a
noise study is not needed. A noise study, when required, shall be peer reviewed
by an independent qualified party, with the associated costs borne by the
developer. If a reduced setback is authorized, failure to operate within the
noise limits specified constitutes a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2012.04,
1-18-2012; amd. 2014 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Thresholds for noise studies. No large wind energy system shall
produce sound at any time, as measured at any neighboring residentially zoned
lot or one hundred feet (100') from any existing inhabitable building that is
not owned or leased by the wind energy developer that exceeds the lesser of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Thirty five (35) dBA (LAeq);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Five (5) dB above the preexisting (L90), nighttime background
noise level of the area (measured in contiguous 10 minute intervals), whether
measured as dBA (LAeq) or dBC (LCeq);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Fifty five (55) dBC (LCeq) if measured in a rural environment
(outside a tier I, II or III area);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Sixty (60) dBC (LCeq) if measured in a suburban environment
(within a tier I, II or III area);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Provided, a five (5) dB penalty shall be applied for
amplitude modulation, meaning the maximum sound threshold is five (5) dB less
than the amount specified in subsection B5b(1) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â All procedures relating to sound measurement are to comply with
standard professional practices, such as ANSI 12.9, part 3, and be conducted by
qualified acoustical consultants. To avoid errors in the estimates and to
properly account for worst case scenarios of sound generation, the calculations
must include the five (5) dBA penalty/addition for amplitude modulation (the
spike above the average noise level as a blade passes the tower, which is a 5
dBA spike when the blades from 2 or more turbines are synchronized), the
addition of three (3) dB for coherent reflection (additional sound reflecting
off the ground) and consideration of the additional sound created by turbulent
inflow (atmospheric turbulence due to wind shear, etc.).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Setback And Noise Waivers: Voluntary waivers or reductions of the
setback and noise limits established by subsections B4a, B4b and B5 of this
section, may be accepted from those neighboring property owners that otherwise
would be within a setback required by one or more of these sections. The
agreement must specifically state the city setback and/or noise standards being
waived or reduced, the extent of the waiver, and be in the form of a legally
binding contract or easement between the landowner (including assignees in
interest) and the wind energy developer, effective for the life of the project.
Notwithstanding any such voluntary agreement between the landowner and the wind
energy developer, the agreement shall only be effective and reflected in the
city's authorization of the project when it has been reviewed and determined
acceptable to the city. The city shall consider the likely impacts and
consequences of the waiver or reduction of the setback and/or noise limit,
based on the specific circumstances of the situation, in determining whether to
grant the request. Any voluntary waiver or reduction agreement must be
submitted with the conditional use permit application and if authorized by the
city, must be filed with the city recorder upon issuance of the conditional use
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Visual Appearance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Large wind energy systems shall be finished and maintained in
color and material as manufactured.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â No large wind energy system shall be lighted unless required by
the federal aviation administration (FAA). When lighting is required by the
FAA, it shall be the red, intermittent, glowing style, rather than the white,
strobe style, unless disclosed and justified through the application review
process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â No advertising signs of any kind or nature shall be permitted on
any large wind energy system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Accessory buildings or related structures shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, use materials, colors and textures that will blend the
facility into the existing environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Large wind energy systems must be located such that they will not
result in any significant amount of shadow flicker on a major public roadway,
or on any inhabitable structures or residentially zoned lots not owned or
leased by the wind project developer/lessor, unless an easement to do so is
obtained from the affected property owner and presented with the application. A
shadow flicker analysis is required with the application if there are any
inhabitable structures or residentially zoned lots not owned or leased by the
wind energy developer, or major public roadways, within 1.21 miles of the
turbine.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Appropriate landscaping or screening materials may be required to
shield screen accessory structures from major roads and adjacent residences.
Lighting of accessory structures and substations shall be limited to the
minimum necessary and full cutoff lighting (e.g., dark sky compliant) may be
required for accessory structures when determined necessary to mitigate visual
impacts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Electrical Interconnections: All electrical interconnection and
distribution lines within the project boundary shall be underground, unless
determined otherwise by the planning commission because of severe environmental
constraints (e.g., wetlands, cliffs, hard bedrock), and except for power lines
within a substation. All electrical interconnections and distribution
components must comply with all applicable codes and public utility
requirements. Transmission lines (33.5 kV lines and above) coming to or leaving
the project may be overhead.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Signal Interference: Efforts shall be made to site large wind energy
systems to reduce the likelihood of blocking or reflecting television and other
communication signals. If signal interference occurs, both the commercial wind
energy system owner and the individual receiving interference shall make
reasonable efforts to resolve the problem. No commercial wind energy system
shall cause permanent and material interference with television, cellular or
other communication signals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Fire Protection: All wind energy systems shall have a defensible
space for fire protection in accordance with the city building codes. (Ord.
2012.04, 1-18-2012)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Permit Applications:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An application for a conditional use permit to establish a
commercial wind energy system shall include a complete description of the
project and documentation to sufficiently demonstrate that the requirements set
forth in subsection B of this section will be met. Supporting documentation for
addressing the review criteria of subsection D of this section is also to be
provided. The land use authority may require any information reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this section. (Ord. 2012.04, 1-18-2012;
amd. 2014 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â It is preferred that any related conditional use permit applications
for substations or transmission lines be considered in conjunction with the
conditional use permit application for the large wind energy system; however,
if the details of those improvements are not available at the time of
application for the large wind energy system, they may be considered later,
through subsequent conditional use permit review. At a minimum, the intended
route for connecting to the power grid and the alternative locations of any
substation shall be disclosed with the application for the large wind energy
system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Due to the complexity of large scale large wind energy projects, the
city may require a development agreement or other appropriate instrument to
address taxing, land use, property assessment and other issues related to the
project. For example, the city is interested in preventing large tax shifts
that may otherwise be incurred by city residents each year the centrally
assessed wind energy project is depreciated; therefore, cooperation to
establish an agreement for payment in lieu of taxes (PILT), or other acceptable
solutions, may be necessary. A development agreement or substitute agreement
may be required as a condition of the permit, and must be approved by the city
council prior to commencing construction.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Conditional Use Permit: Following the provisions of chapter 20 of this
title, additional or more thorough consideration shall be given to the
following as the city determines whether the project needs to be approved,
denied or conditionally approved:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Project rationale, including estimated construction schedule,
project life, phasing, and likely buyers or markets for the generated energy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Siting considerations, such as avoiding areas/locations with a high
potential for biological conflict, such as wilderness study areas, areas of
critical environmental concern, city and state parks, historic trails, special
management areas or important wildlife habitat; avoiding visual corridors that
are designated by the city after analyzing the applicant's wind energy system
proposal and considering public hearing comments; avoiding areas of erodible
slopes and soils, where concerns for water quality, landslide, severe erosion
or high stormwater runoff potential have been identified; and, avoiding known
sensitive historical, cultural or archeological resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Site and development plans, which locate and describe the project
boundaries, all existing and proposed structures, setbacks, access routes,
proposed road improvements, existing inhabitable structures and residentially
zoned lots within 1.21 miles of the project, existing utilities, pipelines,
transmission lines, proposed utility lines/structures, existing topography,
existing and proposed drainageways, proposed grading, natural vegetation
removal, revegetation actions, dust and erosion control, any floodplains or
wetlands, and other relevant items identified by city staff or planning
commission. All maps and visual representations need to be drawn at an
appropriate scale.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Analysis of local economic benefits, describing estimated project
cost, generated property taxes and local sales taxes, percent of construction
dollars to be spent locally, and the number of local construction and permanent
jobs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Visual impacts, appearance and scenic viewsheds. Potential visual
impacts include, but are not limited to, wind towers, rotors, aboveground
electrical lines, accessory structures, access roads, utility trenches and
installations, and alteration of vegetation. The applicant must provide a
viewshed analysis of the project, including visual simulations of the wind
energy systems and any significant planned structures or improvements, such as
new roads on a hillside or substations. The number of visual simulations shall
be sufficient to provide adequate analysis of the visual impacts of the
proposal, which shall be from no less than four (4) vantage points that
together provide a view from all sides of the project. More visually sensitive
proposals may require analysis from significantly more vantage points, such as
different distances and sensitive locations. The planning commission may also
require a zone of theoretical visibility/zone of visual impact (ZVI) analysis,
which is a three hundred sixty degree (360Â°) computer analysis to map the lands

TITLE 11
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
SECTION:
11-1-1: Statutory Authorization
11-1-2: Findings Of Fact
11-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
11-1-4: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
11-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009; amd. 2014 Code)
11-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses are created, in part, by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-
2009)
11-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Protect human life and health;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this title uses the following methods:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
CHAPTER 2
DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
11-2-1: General Definitions
11-2-1: GENERAL DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
title its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition;
and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH or VO zone on the city's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within the city which
is subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given
year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map
(FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for
publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO,
A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor or, in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and b) adequately anchored
so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of
up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99,
AO, AH, B, C, X and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM, or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date.
"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of the city on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the city.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as

with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of interior; or
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Built on a single chassis;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this title when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this title. Any request for a variance from any provision of this title may
only be approved in compliance with Utah Code Annotated title 10, chapter 9a,
and the requirements of section 60.6 of the national flood insurance program
regulations (as amended).
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10),
(d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time
as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)

3-26-2009)
11-3-6: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this title, all provisions shall be:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Considered as minimum requirements;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Liberally construed in favor of the city; and
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-3-7: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this title is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This title does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This title shall
not create liability on the part of the city or any official or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this title or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)

The city council shall hereby appoint a floodplain administrator to administer
and implement the provisions of this title and other appropriate sections of 44
CFR (national flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to floodplain
management. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009; amd. 2014 Code)
11-4-2: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to
the provisions of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site,
including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this title.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and any
coordinating agency within the county and the state, prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
federal emergency management agency.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
section
11-3-2 of this title, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
chapter 5 of this title.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the city's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the city.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the national
flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE or AH, on the city's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'); provided,
that the city first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision). (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-4-3: PERMIT PROCEDURES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,

criteria of subsection 11-5-2B of this title;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection 11-4-2A of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this title and the
following relevant factors:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-4-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Appeal Authority shall be the "Appeal Board" established by the
City and shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this title. (Ord. 2018.07, 12-13-2018)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this title.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may
appeal such decision to the District Court in and for the County.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 11-4-3B of this
chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
title, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this title.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Prerequisites for granting variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Showing a good and sufficient cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A showing of compliance with all requirements set forth in Utah
Code Annotated section 10-9a-702.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use; provided, that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The criteria outlined in subsections A through J of this section are
met; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)

flooding;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-5-2: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
11-3-2 of this title, subsection
11-4-2H of this title, or subsection
11-5-3C of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in
subsection
11-4-3A3 of this title, is satisfied.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Manufactured Homes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on
the city's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM on sites: a) outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision; b) in a new manufactured home park
or subdivision; c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-
30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this
subsection be elevated so that either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Meet the permit requirements of subsection
11-4-3A of this title, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in subsection D of this section. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-5-3: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections
11-1-2,
11-1-3 and
11-1-4 of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
11-3-3 and
11-4-3 of this title and the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5)
acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section
11-3-2 or subsection 11-4-2H of this title.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-5-4: AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
11-3-2 of this title, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the city's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection 11-4-3A3 of this title, are satisfied.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-5-5: FLOODWAYS:
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
11-3-2 of this title, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the national
flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations; provided, that the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and
floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009)
11-5-6: PENALTY:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this title and
other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this title by
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a class C misdemeanor, subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 2009.03, 3-26-2009; amd. 2014 Code)
