approved by the mayor. The initial fee, until changed by resolution, is as set
forth in schedule A, which is on file in the office of the records officer.

electronic services and products together with a reasonable portion of the
costs associated with formatting or interfacing the information for particular
users.
   C.   Exceptions:
      1.   The city may fulfill a record request without charge when it
determines that:
         a.   Releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a
person;
         b.   The individual requesting the record is the subject of the
record, or a person identified in Utah Code Annotated section 63-2-202(1) or
(2); or
         c.   The requester's legal rights are directly implicated by the
information in the record, and the requester is impecunious.

         a.   Reviewing a record to determine whether it is subject to
disclosure;

   D.   Prepayment; Conditions: The city requires payment of past fees and
future estimated fees before beginning to process a request if fees are
expected to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), or if the requester has not paid
fees from previous requests. Any prepaid amount in excess of fees due shall be
returned to the requester.
   E.   Other Fees Established: This section does not alter, repeal or reduce
fees established by other ordinances, statutes or legislative acts. (Ord. 2006-
31, 10-4-2006)
1-9-7: RETENTION OF RECORDS:
   A.   Standards: Retention of the records of the city shall be as set forth
in the model retention schedules maintained by the state archivist for each
specific type of material that is classified as a record under this chapter and
state law. The city shall also establish and report to the state archives
retention schedules for any objects that the city determines are not defined as
a "record" under section
1-9-3 of this chapter, and Utah Code Annotated section 63-2-103, but that have
historical or evidentiary value, when such objects are discovered or
identified.
   B.   Ownership Of Records; Custody:
      1.   Except as provided in subsection B2 of this section, all records
created or maintained by the city are the property of the state and shall not
be mutilated, destroyed or otherwise damaged or disposed of, in whole or in
part, except as provided for in state law.
      2.   Records which constitute a valuable intellectual property shall be
the property of the city.
      3.   The state archives may, upon request from the city, take custody of
any record series of the city. If the city no longer wishes to maintain custody
of a record which must be retained under the state's retention schedules, the
city shall transfer it to the state archives for safekeeping and management.
   C.   Intentional Damage Unlawful: It is unlawful for the city to
intentionally mutilate, destroy or otherwise damage or dispose of a record
series knowing that such mutilation, destruction or damage is in contravention
of the state's retention schedules. (Ord. 2006-31, 10-4-2006)
1-9-8: ACCESS REQUESTS; PROCEDURE:
   A.   Information Required: A person making a request for a record shall
furnish the city with a written request containing his name, mailing address,
daytime telephone number, if available, and a description of the record
requested that identifies the record with reasonable specificity. Before a
person receives a record, the lawful fees set forth in this chapter shall be
paid. If the record is private, controlled or protected, the city shall obtain
evidence of the requester's identity before releasing the record. A person may
request that the record provided be certified. Subpoenas and other methods of
discovery under the state or federal statutes or rules of civil procedure are
not written requests under this section.
   B.   Ordered Disclosures:
      1.   In judicial or administrative proceedings in which an individual is
requesting discovery of records classified private, controlled or protected
under this chapter, or otherwise restricted from access by other statutes, the
court or an administrative law judge shall follow the procedure in subsection K
of this section before ordering disclosure. Until the court or an
administrative law judge orders disclosure, these records are privileged from
discovery.
      2.   If the court or administrative order requires disclosure, the terms
of the order may limit the requester's further use and disclosure of the record
in accordance with subsection K of this section, in order to protect the
privacy interests recognized in this chapter.
      3.   This section does not otherwise limit a person's right to obtain
records through the procedures set forth in this chapter, unless the court or
an administrative law judge includes such a limitation in its order.
   C.   Time Limits: Unless the city determines that there are circumstances
constituting "extraordinary circumstances" 1 , as soon as reasonably possible,
but no later than ten (10) business days after receiving a written request, or
five (5) business days after receiving a written request if the requester
demonstrates that expedited response to the record request benefits the public
rather than the person, the city shall respond to the request by:
      1.   Approving the request and providing the record;
      2.   Denying the request;
      3.   Notifying the requester that it does not maintain the record and
providing, if known, the name and address of where the record can be found; or
      4.   Notifying the requester that because of one of the extraordinary
circumstances listed in subsection D1 of this section, it cannot immediately
approve or deny the request.
   D.   Extraordinary Circumstances:
      1.   Specified: The following circumstances constitute "extraordinary
circumstances" that allow the city to delay approval or denial of a records
request by an additional period of time as specified in subsection D3 of this
section:
         a.   Another governmental entity is using the record, in which case
the city shall promptly request the governmental entity currently in possession
to return the record;
         b.   Another governmental entity is using the record as part of an
audit and returning the record before the completion of the audit would impair
the conduct of the audit;
         c.   The request is for a voluminous quantity of records;
         d.   The city is currently processing a large number of records
requests;
         e.   The request requires the city to review a large number of records
to locate the records requested;
         f.   The decision to release a record involves legal issues that
require the city to seek legal counsel for the analysis of statutes, rules,
ordinances, regulations or case law;
         g.   Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect
from information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires
extensive editing; or
         h.   Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect
from information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires
computer programming.
      2.   Notice: The records officer shall provide the requester with written
notice of the extraordinary circumstance or circumstances which do not allow
the city to provide records in the time specified in subsection C of this
section and shall specify the earliest time and date when the record will be
available.
      3.   Extended Time Limits: If one of the extraordinary circumstances
listed in subsection D1 of this section precludes approval or denial within the
time specified in subsection C of this section, the following time limits apply
to the extraordinary circumstances:
         a.   For claims under subsection D1a of this section, the city shall
produce the record within ten (10) business days of the request for the return
from the governmental entity holding the record, unless returning the record
would impair the holder's work;
         b.   For claims under subsection D1b of this section, the city shall
notify the requester when the record is available for inspection and copying;
         c.   For claims under subsections D1c, D1d and D1e of this section,
the city shall:
            (1)   Disclose the records that it has located which the requester
is entitled to inspect;
            (2)   Provide the requester with an estimate of the amount of time
it will take to finish the work required to respond to the request; and
            (3)   Complete the work and disclose the records the requester is
entitled to inspect as soon as reasonably possible;
         d.   For delays under subsection D1f of this section, the city shall
either approve or deny the request within fifteen (15) business days after the
response time specified for the original request has expired;
         e.   For delays under subsection D1g of this section, the city shall
fulfill the request within twenty (20) business days after the response time
specified for in the original request has expired; or
         f.   For delays under subsection D1h of this section, the city shall
complete its programming and disclose the requested records as soon as
reasonably possible.
   E.   Appeals: If the city claims extraordinary circumstances and specifies
the date when the records will be available and, if the requester believes the
extraordinary circumstances do not exist or that the time specified is
unreasonable, the requester may appeal the city's claim of extraordinary
circumstances in accordance with section
1-9-18 of this chapter within thirty (30) days after notification of a claim of
extraordinary circumstances by the city, despite the lack of a "determination"
or its equivalent.
   F.   Limited City Resources: The time limits to respond to a request where
extraordinary circumstances are involved are so set as to provide the requested
records within a reasonable time, while at the same time recognizing the city's
limited resources to respond to such a request.
   G.   Failure To Provide Within Time Requested: If the city fails to provide
the requested records or issues a denial within the specified time period of
either subsection C or D3 of this section, that failure is considered the
equivalent of a determination denying access to the records, unless the city
and the requester have agreed in writing to an extension of the time period.
The city may not use the physical form, electronic or otherwise, in which a
record is stored to deny, or unreasonably hinder the rights of persons to
inspect and receive copies of the record under this chapter.
   H.   Duplicative Requests: Nothing in this chapter requires the city to
fulfill a person's records request if the request unreasonably duplicates prior
records requests from that person.
   I.   Voluminous Records: If a person requests copies of more than fifty (50)
pages of records, and if the records are contained in files that do not contain
records that are exempt from disclosure, the city may:
      1.   Provide the requester with the facilities for copying the requested
records and require the requester make the copies himself; or
      2.   Allow the requester to provide his own copying facilities and
personnel to make the copies at the city offices and waive the fees for copying
the records.
   J.   Intellectual Property Rights:
      1.   If the city owns an intellectual property right and offers the
intellectual property right for sale or license, the city may control by
ordinance or policy the duplication and distribution of the material based on
the terms the city considers to be in the public interest;
      2.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the
rights or protections granted to the city under federal copyright or patent law
as a result of its ownership of the intellectual property right.
   K.   Court Ordered Disclosure: The city shall disclose a record pursuant to
the terms of the court order signed by a judge from a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided, that:
      1.   The record deals with a matter in controversy over which the court
has jurisdiction;
      2.   The court has considered the merits of the request for access to the
record;
      3.   The court has considered and, where appropriate, limited the
requester's use and further disclosure of the record in order to protect
privacy interests in the case of private or controlled records, business
confidentiality interest in the case of records protected under Utah Code
Annotated sections 63-2-304(1) and (2), and privacy interests or the public
interest in the case of other protected records;
      4.   To the extent the record is properly classified private, controlled
or protected, the interest favoring access, considering limitations thereon,
outweighs the interest favoring restrictions of access; and
      5.   Where access is restricted by a rule, statute or regulation referred
to in subsection 1-9-5B2b of this chapter, the court has authority independent
of this chapter to order disclosure.
   L.   Research Purposes:
      1.   The city may disclose or authorize disclosure of private or
controlled records for research purposes if the city:
         a.   Determines that the research purpose cannot reasonably be
accomplished without use of disclosure of the information to the researcher in
individually identifiable form;
         b.   Determines that the proposed research is bona fide, and that the
value of the research outweighs the infringement upon personal privacy;
         c.   Requires the researcher to assure the integrity, confidentiality
and security of the records and requires the removal or destruction of the
individual identifiers associated with the records as soon as the purpose of
the research project has been accomplished;
         d.   Prohibits the researcher from disclosing the record in
individually identifiable form, except as provided in subsection L2 of this
section, or from using the record for purposes other than the research approved
by the city; and
         e.   Secures from the researcher a written statement of his
understanding of and agreement to the conditions of this subsection and his
understanding that violation of the terms of this subsection may subject him to
criminal prosecution under Utah Code Annotated section 63-2-801.
      2.   A researcher may disclose a record in individually identifiable form
if the record is disclosed for the purpose of auditing or evaluating the
research program and no subsequent use or disclosure of the record in
individually identifiable form will be made by the auditor or evaluator, except
as provided by this subsection.
      3.   The city may require indemnification as a condition of permitting
research under this subsection.
   M.   Disclosure To Another Governmental Entity: The city may disclose a
record classified private, controlled or protected to another governmental
entity, city, another state, the United States, or a foreign government only as
provided by Utah Code Annotated section 63-2-206.

   B.   Classification: The city may classify a particular record, record
series or information within a record at any time, but is not required to
classify a particular record, record series or information until access of the
record is requested. The city may redesignate a record series or reclassify a
record or record series, or information within a record at any time. If more
than one provision of this chapter could govern the classification of a record,
the city shall classify the record by considering the nature of the interest
intended to be protected and specificity of the competing provisions. Nothing
in subsection 1-9-11B or sections
1-9-12 and
1-9-13 of this chapter require the city to classify a record as private,
controlled or confidential.
   C.   Business Confidentiality:
      1.   Any person who provides a governmental entity a record that he
believes should be protected under subsections 1-9-13A1 and A2 of this chapter
shall provide with the record a written claim of business confidentiality and a
concise statement of reasons supporting the claim of business confidentiality.
      2.   The claimant shall be notified by the governmental entity if the
record claimed to be protected under subsections 1-9-13A1 and A2 of this
chapter is classified public or if the governmental entity determines that the
record should be released after balancing interests under subsections 1-9-11C3,
1-9-13C and 1-9-18D5 of this chapter.
      3.   Except as provided by court order, the governmental entity may not
disclose records claimed to be protected under subsections 1-9-13A1 and A2 of
this chapter, but which it determines should be classified public until the
period in which to bring an appeal expires or the end of the appeal process,
including judicial appeal. This subsection does not apply where the claimant,
after notice, has waived the claim by not appealing or intervening before the
city council.

section does not constitute misappropriation under Utah Code Annotated section
13-24-2(2).

protection of persons or property, public or private, are not subject to this

information as defined in 45 CFR, part 164, standards for privacy of

1-9-19: CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT; NO APPLICABLE EXEMPTION:
   A.   Court Order: A court may, on appeal or in a declaratory or other
action, order the confidential treatment of records for which no exemption from

interests favoring access.
   B.   City Request Access; Attorney Fees: If the city requests a court to

disclosure could reasonably apply to the record in question; and
      2.   The court denies confidential treatment under this section.
   C.   Exception: This section does not apply to records that are specifically
required to be public under section
1-9-10 of this chapter or Utah Code Annotated section 63-2-301, or by other
LaVerkin ordinances or Utah statutes, except as provided in subsection D of
this section.
   D.   Limited Access:
      1.   Access to drafts and empirical data in drafts may be limited under
this section, but the court may consider, in its evaluation of interests
favoring restriction of access, only those interests that relate to the
underlying information, and not to the deliberative nature of the record.
      2.   Access to original data in a computer program may be limited under
this section, but the court may consider, in its evaluation of interest
favoring restriction of access, only those interests that relate to the
underlying information, and not to the status of that data as part of a

prohibited, is guilty of a class B misdemeanor and subject to penalty as
provided in section
1-4-1 of this title.
      2.   It is a defense to prosecution under subsection A1 of this section

expose a violation of law involving government corruption, abuse of office or
misappropriation of public funds or property.
      3.   It is a defense to prosecution under subsection A1 of this section
that the record could have been released to the recipient if it had been

1-4-1 of this title. (Ord. 2006-31, 10-4-2006)
CHAPTER 10
CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUES
SECTION:
1-10-1: Policy Considerations
1-10-2: Definitions
1-10-3: Application Of Takings Principles
1-10-4: Judicial Remedies Of City
1-10-5: Guidelines Advisory
1-10-6: Review Of Decision
1-10-7: Action Upon Review
1-10-1: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
There is an underlying policy in the city, strongly favoring the careful
consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to
the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty
and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same
time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property
must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction
of property consistent with the federal constitution and Utah constitution.
Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for
the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking.
These provisions assist the city council in considering decisions that may
involve constitutional takings. This chapter is further intended and shall be
construed to provide objective and fair review of claims by citizens that a
specific government action should require payment of just compensation while
preserving the ability of the city to lawfully regulate real property and
fulfill its other duties and functions. (Ord. 95-10, 9-6-1995)
1-10-2: DEFINITIONS:
CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING: Actions by the city of LaVerkin involving the physical
taking, regulatory taking or exaction of private real property that might
require compensation to a private real property owner because of:
   A.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United
States;
   B.   Article 1, section 22 of the Utah constitution;
   C.   Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private
real property by a government entity.
EXACTION OF REAL PROPERTY: A condition of permit approval affecting real
property. Exactions include, by way of example and not of limitation,
dedications of property or easements.
PHYSICAL TAKING: Actions by the city of LaVerkin involving the physical
invasion of a private person's real property. Physical invasion includes, but
may not be limited to: a) direct appropriation; and b) physical ouster of
possession, except where such physical invasion or ouster is permitted to abate
nuisances and dangerous structures.
REGULATORY TAKING: Regulatory actions of the city of LaVerkin which deprive the
private landowner of all economically beneficial use, where the use sought for
the property is not already proscribed by federal law, state law, local law or
this state's common law of property and nuisance 1 .
REVIEWING BODY: The city council, unless the city council is the maker of the
decision giving rise to the constitutional taking claim, in which case the
reviewing body shall consist of the city manager, public works director and
city clerk/recorder ("administration committee"). With respect to the
administration committee, a quorum shall consist of two (2) members and any
action approved by said administration committee shall be approved by at least
two (2) members. With respect to the city council, quorum and voting
requirements shall be governed by Utah Code Annotated sections 10-3-401 et seq.
and 10-3-501 et seq. (Ord. 95-10, 9-6-1995; amd. 1998 Code)
 
Notes
  1. Where the private landowner has not suffered a complete loss of all
  economic value of this land, "such an owner might not be able to claim the
  benefit of [a categorical regulatory taking], but, ... '[t]he economic impact
  of the regulation on the claimant and ... the extent to which the regulation
  has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations' are keenly
  relevant to takings analysis." Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 120
  L. Ed. 2d 798, 815, fn. 8 (U.S. Supreme Court 1992 (quoting Penn Central
  Transportation Co. v. New York Town, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978). Where distinct
1 investment backed expectations are involved, the takings issue will be
  decided on a case by case basis. It may be that in one case a private
  landowner with a 95 percent loss will get no compensation and that in another
  case a landowner with a 95 percent loss will be compensated. Takings cases
  are full of such disparities and "all or nothing" situations. This footnote
  is intended for and provided to assist officers, employees, boards,
  commissions, and the city council in making determinations which may involve
  a constitutional taking and for the reviewing body when hearing an appeal on
  a constitutional taking claim. Id.
1-10-3: APPLICATION OF TAKINGS PRINCIPLES:
   A.   Physical Taking: Action by the city involving the ouster from or the
physical invasion of real property is not a physical taking, where such ouster
or physical invasion is permitted to abate nuisances and dangerous structures.
   B.   Regulatory Taking:
      1.   Action by the city involving regulation of real property which
results in the diminution in value of the property (but which does not deprive
the landowner of all economic use) is not a regulatory taking where the land
use regulation substantially advances a legitimate interest 1 .
      2.   Action by the city involving regulation of real property which
results in the deprivation of all economically beneficial use of the property
is not a regulatory taking where the use sought for the property is already
proscribed by federal law, state law, local law or this state's common law of
property and nuisance. The "total taking" inquiry will ordinarily entail
analysis of:
         a.   The degree of harm to public lands and resources or adjacent
private property, posed by the claimant's proposed activities;
         b.   The social value of the claimant's activities and their
suitability to the locality in question;
         c.   The relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided
through measures taken by the claimant and the government alike; and
         d.   Whether a particular use has been engaged in by similarly
situated landowners.
   C.   Constitutional Taking: Action by the city involving the exaction of
private real property is not a constitutional taking if the exaction:
      1.   Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
      2.   Is objectively demonstrated by the city to be roughly proportionate
and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both in nature and
extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate government
interest.
For example, it has been held that there is: a) a nexus (substantial
connection) where an ordinance requires a portion of a residential development
be dedicated as a public park; b) which dedication serves the legitimate
government interest of preserving the health and welfare of the citizens, and
beautifying the community; c) provided, that the park requirement, on an
individualized property basis, is roughly proportionate and reasonably related
to the government interest to be served. Simply put, a large park for a small
residential development would not meet the rough proportionality test. (Ord.
95-10, 9-6-1995)
 
Notes
1 1. See footnote for the definition of "regulatory taking" in section
  1-10-2 of this chapter.
1-10-4: JUDICIAL REMEDIES OF CITY:
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, nothing shall limit the
ability of the city to seek immediate judicial relief and intervention for any
constitutional taking initiated by the city including, but not limited to,
eminent domain proceedings under Utah Code Annotated section 78-34-1 et seq.
(Ord. 95-10, 9-6-1995)
1-10-5: GUIDELINES ADVISORY:
The guidelines adopted and decisions rendered pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter are advisory, and shall not be construed to expand or limit the
scope of the city's liability for a constitutional taking. In addition to
following, the guidelines set forth in section
1-10-3 of this chapter when reviewing a claim for a constitutional taking, all
officers, employees, boards, commissions and the city council shall consider
the guidelines set forth in
1-10-3 of this chapter when taking any action that might result in a
constitutional taking of real property. (Ord. 95-10, 9-6-1995)
1-10-6: REVIEW OF DECISION:
Any owner of private real property who claims there has been a constitutional
taking of their private real property shall request a review of a final
decision of any officer, employee, board, commission or city council. The
following are specific procedures established for such a review:
   A.   Final Determination Required: The person requesting a review must have
obtained a final and authoritative determination, internally, within the city,
relative to the decision from which they are requesting review.
   B.   Request For Review: Within thirty (30) days from the date of the final
decision that gave rise to the concern that a constitutional taking has
occurred, the person requesting the review shall file in writing, in the office
of the city clerk/recorder, a request for review of that decision. A copy shall
also be filed with the city attorney. If included in the written request, the
appeal may be bifurcated into an appeal on the constitutional takings claim, to
be followed within twenty one (21) days by a hearing on the value of the
property right taken, if necessary. If the appeal is bifurcated, the required
items set forth in subsections D10 through D14 of this section, unless
specifically required by the reviewing body, will not be required of the
applicant at the hearing on the constitutional takings claim, but will be
required seven (7) days in advance of any hearing on the value of the property
right taken.
   C.   Review Time Set: The reviewing body shall, within five (5) working
days, set a time to review the decision that gave rise to the constitutional
takings claim.
   D.   Required Information; Materials: In addition to the written request for
review, the applicant must submit, seven (7) days prior to the date of the
review, the following:
      1.   Name of the applicant requesting review;
      2.   Name and business address of current owner of the property, form of
ownership, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not for profit
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other, and if owned by a
corporation, partnership or joint venture, name and address of all principal
shareholders or partners;
      3.   A detailed description of the grounds for the claim that there has
been a constitutional taking;
      4.   A detailed description of the property purportedly taken;
      5.   Nature of the protectable interest claimed to be affected, such as,
but not limited to, fee simple ownership, leasehold interest, etc.;
      6.   All information concerning current mortgages or other loans secured
by the property, including name of the mortgagee or lender, current interest
rate, remaining loan balance and term of the loan and other significant
provisions, including, but not limited to, right of purchasers to assume the
loan;
      7.   All studies commissioned by the petitioner or agents of the
petitioner within the previous three (3) years concerning feasibility of
development or utilization of the property;
      8.   For income producing property, itemized income and expense
statements from the property for the previous three (3) years;
      9.   The reviewing body may request additional information reasonably
necessary, in their opinion, to assist them in reviewing the constitutional
taking issue;
      10.   Evidence and documentation as to the value of the property taken,
including the date and cost at the date the property was acquired. This should
include any evidence of the value of that same property before and after the
alleged constitutional taking, the name of the party from whom purchased,
including the relationship, if any, between the person requesting a review and
the party from whom the property was acquired;
      11.   Terms (including sale price) of any previous purchase or sale of a
full or partial interest in the property in the three (3) years prior to the

3-6A-2: PURPOSE:
   A.   Interests:
      1.   Residents of the city have an inalienable interest in their personal
safety, well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability
to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief,
political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in
commerce.
      2.   The city has a substantial interest in protecting the well being,
tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the
ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property.
      3.   The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from
fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal
activity.
   B.   Balance: There must be a balance between these substantial interests of
the city and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this article on
the rights of those who are regulated.
   C.   Promotion Of Interests: Based on the collective experiences of city
officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and
property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens
regarding door to door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement
officers and those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as
well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional
protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door to door
solicitation, the city adopts this article to promote the city's substantial
interests in:
      1.   Respecting citizens' decisions regarding privacy in their
residences;
      2.   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
      3.   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
      4.   Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation
regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
   D.   Findings: The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set
forth in this article are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city
interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of
those regulated. (Ord. 2007-32, 12-5-2007, eff. 3-1-2008)

uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for door to door
solicitation in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the
business, shall be required to have such solicitors obtain a certificate,
unless otherwise exempt from registration.
   C.   Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered
solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or
registration from the city, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed
place of business in the city.
   D.   Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other
requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any
license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise
required to have or maintain. (Ord. 2007-32, 12-5-2007, eff. 3-1-2008)

elderly persons in a family type arrangement.
A residential facility shall not include:
   A.   Any facility which is operated as a business (provided, that such
facility may not be considered to be operated as a business solely because a
fee is charged for food or for actual and necessary costs of operation and
maintenance of the facility).

3-7-3: SPECIAL GUIDELINES:
In order to determine which types of CLFs will work best in which zones,
certain properties of proposed enterprises must be considered.
   A.   For the purpose of this chapter, a "small" CLF is one in which eight
(8) or fewer "residents" are housed.
   B.   For the purpose of this chapter, a "large" CLF is one in which more
than eight (8) residents are housed.
   C.   For the purposes of this chapter, an "open" residence is one where
inhabitants come and go as they please, where movements of occupants and their
visitors are unrestricted by formal program rules or by external law. An "open"
facility is one in which residents have unrestricted interaction with the
community. Such facilities encourage integration of residents in a neighborhood
atmosphere and in commercial areas, connect and enhance surrounding commerce
spaces.
   D.   For the purposes of this chapter, a "closed" residence is one where
inhabitants are strictly monitored, where movements of occupants may be limited
by formal program rules and/or external law. A "closed" facility does not
necessarily provide unrestricted interaction with the community. Such
facilities do not encourage unsupervised integration into the neighborhood.
   E.   For the purposes of this chapter, a "permanent" residence or CLF means
any building or portion thereof where individuals are actually residing at a
given point in time and intend to remain. It is not a place of temporary
sojourn or transient visit.
   F.   For the purposes of this chapter, a "temporary" CLF or residence means
any building or portion thereof intended to house occupants on a temporary
basis. (Ord. 2005-13, 4-20-2005)
3-7-4: STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirements:
      1.   A CLF shall comply with all standards, provisions and rules of the
applicable sections of Utah administrative code. A CLF is subject to the
LaVerkin City zoning requirements, the standards contained herein, and the
exemptions below.
      2.   A CLF shall comply with all building, safety, and health regulations
applicable to similar structures. As part of this requirement the following
site development standards and parking standards shall be applicable: (Ord.
2005-13, 4-20-2005)
         a.   Each CLF in a residential zone shall be subject to minimum site
development standards applicable to a one-family dwelling or other similar
dwelling in the zone in which the CLF is located. (Ord. 2009-06, 4-15-2009)
         b.   The minimum number of parking spaces required for a CLF in
residential zones shall be the same as those for a similar dwelling located in
the same zoning district in which the CLF is located.
         c.   A CLF in a residential zone shall not have any structural or
landscaping alterations that would change the residential character of the
structure or the surrounding area.
      3.   Any conversion, remodel or alteration of buildings or new
construction of a CLF shall require that the development standards of LaVerkin
City zoning ordinance and the LaVerkin City general plan are met.
      4.   Any conversion of existing buildings or uses to a CLF, or any new
construction of a CLF shall provide at least thirty percent (30%) of the area
as open green space or playground, sufficient parking to service the number of
vehicles likely to be used by the maximum allowed number of residents, and
adequate off street parking spaces for the staff and visitors of the CLF as
determined by the city council. The city council may reduce the parking
requirement as part of the conditional use permit or license approval upon a
finding that less parking will meet the needs of the public and the proposed
program.
      5.   The number of residents in a CLF shall not increase above eight (8)
unless a conditional use permit is recommended by the planning and zoning
commission and is approved by the city council.
      6.   The planning and zoning commission and city council shall consider
the general plan, protection of neighborhood character, permitted uses in
underlying zones, and the aesthetics of any proposed building in making its
recommendations and/or approval to any CLF.
      7.   In review of any application for reasonable accommodation, the city
council shall consider whether the use proposed will fill a demonstrated
community need and shall analyze the anticipated impact of the proposal on
surrounding, existing or intended uses, including the result with any written
findings made. Consideration and analysis may include, but are not limited to:
field trips to the site, commissioned studies, expert opinions, etc. Before
granting any application for reasonable accommodation, the city council shall
find:
         a.   That the applicant is eligible for reasonable accommodation
because the facility will house a meaningful proportion of the legally
disabled;
         b.   That the accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of
life of the disabled by ameliorating the effects of their disabilities;
         c.   That the accommodation will impose no undue financial or
administrative hardship on the city;
         d.   That the accommodation proposed is necessary to provide an equal
opportunity for housing to the disabled;
         e.   That the accommodation will not adversely impact the harmony or
intended character of the zone;
         f.   That the proposed accommodation will not adversely impact
legislative goals of the rule being relaxed, including those designed to
protect the aquifer and comply with the guidelines of the city's contract with
the Washington County water conservancy district.
      8.   All recipients of facility services shall reside on site.
      9.   Any CLF which is a business shall maintain active, current business
entity status with the Utah department of commerce and current business
licensure from LaVerkin City.
      10.   Prior to the occupancy of any CLF requiring state licensure or
certification, the person or entity to be licensed or certified shall:
         a.   Provide a copy of such license or certification to the city,
         b.   Certify to the city that no person will reside or remain in the
facility whose tenancy would likely constitute a direct threat to the health or
safety of other individuals, or result in substantial physical damage to the
property of others.
   B.   Large CLFs:
      1.   All CLFs housing more than eight (8) persons shall require a
conditional use permit. For purposes of state licensure, a CLF may receive
preliminary approval of the permit from the city council. However, final
approval is contingent upon receipt and review of documentation of compliance
with all federal, state, and local regulations and requirements, by the city
council. Preliminary approval is offered as a convenience and is in no way
assurance of final granting of the permit if all requirements are not met.
      2.   The application for a conditional use permit shall include
sufficiently detailed site plans, building plans or remodeling plans, and all
other information necessary to determine compliance with building, fire and
health regulations and standards applicable to similar dwellings. Any
alterations must be reviewed and recommended for approval by the city planning
and zoning commission and shall be approved by the city council before a
conditional use permit is approved.
      3.   The LaVerkin City planning and zoning commission may recommend and
council may approve a conditional use permit to operate a CLF they deem to be
in harmony with the zone, the surrounding uses, and the general plan; and in
the best interests of the health, safety and welfare of the city, within the
limits of this code, Utah Code Annotated, and Utah administrative code.
Commission and council shall consider in their decisions any anticipated
impacts of traffic, noise, disruption, added infrastructure, or saturation in
the location proposed.
      4.   A business plan and a community impact study shall be provided by
the applicant as part of the application for the conditional use permit at
applicant's expense, and shall be conducted by an appropriately qualified firm
or individual within any guideline passed by resolution of the city (if any).
The findings shall include results of a ground water protection study, and
shall specifically describe and evaluate the programs provided and the impact
of the CLF on:
         a.   Local schools,
         b.   The city's economy and economic resources,
         c.   The tax revenue of the city,
         d.   The city's infrastructure including water hookup, sewer, septic
and floodplain concerns,
         e.   Public safety and law enforcement,
         f.   Traffic,
         g.   Aesthetics,
         h.   Tourism,
         i.   Neighboring properties and businesses,
         j.   The impact on property values, if any, and
         k.   The impact of any other uses within or proposed within the same
building to be used as a CLF.
      5.   The number of residents in a CLF shall not increase above the number
allowed in the conditional use permit unless an amendment to the permit is
recommended by the planning and zoning commission and approved by the city
council. Any request for amendment to any CLF conditional use permit shall be

operating without a current and valid business license from the city, issued
pursuant to the rules, regulations, and procedures of chapter 1 of this title
and this chapter.

grandfathered under prior law) are and constitute transient facilities, subject
to government regulation, the licensing requirements of chapter 1 of this
title, and the transient room tax imposed pursuant to chapter 8 of this title.
However, there are substantial differences between the character of BnB and VR
facilities and other types of transient facilities, and the degree of
regulation necessary to protect against harm to occupants of BnBs and VRs and
adjoining properties. Therefore BnBs and VRs:
      1.   Shall be operated and maintained in general conformity with:
         a.   The spirit and intent of this chapter.
         b.   The intent of the city council that such uses be operated and
maintained in such a manner as to be compatible with and not adversely affect
neighboring permitted uses within the community.
      2.   Shall be operated and maintained, and otherwise governed, by the
terms, conditions, and provisions of sections
3-11-2 and
3-11-10 of this chapter (except that daily inspections shall not be required),
this section, and the remedial and penalty provisions of section
3-11-13 of this chapter.
   B.   Management: Each BnB facility must maintain an office on the premises
in the charge and under the immediate supervision of a manager or attendant at
all times. Such office shall remain continuously open and staffed whenever
there are guests registered or present and whenever the facility is open to
receive guests.
   C.   Disclosure Of Available Rooms:
      1.   Each BnB and vacation rental (hereinafter "VR") facility shall
disclose to the business license officer the current number of rooms available
and/or held out for public accommodation, or, in the case of VRs, the total
number of people the dwelling can safely accommodate (which number shall first
be determined by the city building official, in accordance with the applicable

facility.
   D.   Display Of License: A current, valid business license shall be posted
in a conspicuous place in each BnB and VR facility.

occupied by a greater number of persons than that which: 1) it is designed or
furnished to accommodate and 2) is permitted under the applicable building and
building related codes adopted by the city (see title 9, chapter 1 of this
code). The requirements of said codes differ for facility occupancies of ten
(10) or fewer persons, and for occupancies of greater than ten (10) persons.
   F.   Responsibility For Minors: No BnB or VR facility unit shall be rented,
leased, or registered to any person under the age of eighteen (18) years. Each

or VR facility premises at all times while there are minors occupying such
unit.
   G.   Length Of Stay: No person shall occupy or contract to occupy any unit
or combination of units at any one BnB or VR facility for longer than twenty

facility premises for longer than twenty nine (29) consecutive days.
   H.   Sanitary Facilities:
      1.   Each BnB or VR facility unit held out for public accommodation must
comply with the minimum rules established by the Utah department of health.
      2.   It shall be unlawful to rent, lease, or otherwise hold out for
public accommodation any transient lodging facility unit which does not have:
         a.   A complete operable bathroom, including flush toilet, sink, and
bath or shower in working order; and
         b.   For each guest, an adequate daily supply of at least the
following sanitary supplies: hot and cold running water, soap, towels, toilet
paper, and clean linen.
      3.   Each BnB and VR facility shall be cleaned after the departure of
each guest and before the arrival of any subsequent guest.

these regulations, will be performed at the time of business license review.
Additional inspections may be performed with twenty four (24) hour notice to
the license holder if deemed necessary by the city; provided that, no prior
notice is required in situations where emergency conditions exist or the city
has a good faith belief that the safety of the occupants is in danger and/or
the occupancy load of the facility is being exceeded.
   J.   Contact Information; Contact Person(s):
      1.   License holders and owners of BnB and VR facilities shall, at all
times that they are operational, provide and maintain with the city up to date
and current personal contact information regarding such holder, owner, operator

person(s)").
      2.   Such contact person(s) shall: a) be a resident of Washington County;
b) be able to provide information on current occupants to police and/or
emergency personnel as needed; and c) respond to complaints and concerns within
one hour of any phone call. Failure to respond is a violation hereof and may
result in fines to the business license holder and property owner.
   K.   BnB And VR Facilities In Residential Zones:
      1.   Restrictions imposed by this subsection are in recognition of the
premise that BnBs and VRs provide lodging for a transient population that may
or may not honor neighborhood mores or exhibit neighborly consideration to the
same extent as permanent residents. No new VR facility may be created or
operated, and no existing VR facility may be expanded, in residential zones:
these rules and regulations apply to those VR facilities licensed and
operational before they were no longer permitted in residential zones.
      2.   A business license for a BnB or VR in a residential zone shall only
be approved and issued, or renewed, by the city if:
         a.   The BnB or VR dwelling unit is located in an existing single-
family dwelling.
         b.   The owner of the BnB or VR facility provides address labels and
stamped envelopes for all other residential property owners within three
hundred feet (300') of the facility, so that the city may provide to those
owners: 1) a copy of the regulations set forth in this subsection, 2) the
contact information for the facility owner, and 3) the responsible party
contact number for concerns.
      3.   The BnB or VR facility and property shall be maintained to the
following minimum standards:
         a.   Structures shall be properly maintained, painted and kept in good
repair, and grounds and landscaped areas shall be properly maintained and
watered, in order that the use does not detract from the general appearance of
the neighborhood; and
         b.   Required parking areas and access to parking areas shall be
maintained and available for use at all times. Parking for this use shall be
contained on the site, and shall not be allowed on the public rights of way.
Parking may not impact more than forty percent (40%) of a front yard.
      4.   The use of a dwelling as a BnB or VR shall not change the appearance
of the dwelling or property for residential purposes.
      5.   Outdoor pools, hot tubs or spas shall not be used between the hours
of eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. and six o'clock (6:00) A.M.
      6.   The owner or operator of the BnB or VR facility shall ensure that
occupants thereof do not:
         a.   Create noises that by reason of time, nature, intensity or
duration are out of character with noises customarily heard in the surrounding
residential neighborhood.
         b.   Disturb the peace of surrounding residential property residents.
         c.   Interfere with the privacy of or trespass onto surrounding
residential properties.
         d.   Allow pets to do anything listed in subsections K6a through K6c

posted in a prominent location in or on the BnB or VR facility.
   L.   Application Of This Section: The requirements of this section shall be
in effect throughout the time a BnB or VR business license is in effect on the
property, notwithstanding that such property may be occupied by the owner or
nonpaying guests of the owner. The City finds that, given the practical
difficulty of determining whether or not the occupants are paying guests,
enforcement of the requirements shall be based on whether the property is
licensed as a BnB or VR at the relevant time.
   M.   Violations; Remedies: Owners, operators, and license holders of BnBs
and VRs, and owners of the property whereupon such BnBs and VRs are situated,
who violate the provisions of this section (herein known as "violators") are
subject to the remedies and penalties set forth in section
3-11-13 of this chapter, provided that: (Ord. 2015-05, 7-1-2015)
      1.   Violation of any subsection of this section shall constitute a
separate violation for each day it occurs or continues. Operation of a BnB or
VR facility without a current LaVerkin City business license is considered a
violation; and each day of operation shall be considered a separate offense.
Evidence of operation shall not require verification of the presence of guests,
but may be determined by any manner not proscribed by State or Federal law.
(Ord. 2018-01, 1-3-2018)
      2.   Violators shall be issued written citations containing a description
of the nature of the violation and the amount of fine levied in accordance with
the fee schedule for an infraction, provided that, such fine shall not be less
than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
      3.   The business license for a BnB or VR facility may be revoked,
suspended, or denied renewal if three (3) citations are issued within any
twelve (12) month period. (Ord. 2015-05, 7-1-2015; amd. Ord. 2022-10, 9-21-

In addition to a possible denial, suspension, revocation or refusal by the City
to renew a business license as outlined in section
3-1-13 of this title, any licensee who shall operate a transient lodging
facility in violation of this chapter (and/or any person designated by the
licensee as the manager or person in charge of daily operation of said
facility, who shall permit or allow said facility to operate in violation of
this chapter) shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be punished for each
offense by a fine as provided in title 1, chapter 4 of this Code. (Ord. 2013-
09, 7-17-2013; amd. Ord. 2015-05, 7-1-2015)

safety concerns of the resort's patrons and staff. That caretaker may be the
manager or representative thereof; and he or she (and his or her household, if
any) may reside within the resort, as well as a limited number of employees and
their households, subject to the provisions of subsection 10-6G2-2-5B4 of this
Code.
   C.   Violations; Remedies: Owners, operators, and license holders of RV
resorts and/or other transient lodging facilities allowed or otherwise provided
for herein, who violate the provisions of this section (herein known as
"violators"), are subject to the remedies and penalties set forth in section
3-11-13 of this chapter, provided that:
      1.   Violation of any subsection of this section shall constitute a
separate violation for each day it occurs or continues. Operation of the RV
resort and/or other transient lodging facility without a current and valid
LaVerkin City business license is considered a violation; and each day of
operation shall be considered a separate offense. Evidence of operation shall
not require verification of the presence of guests, but may be determined by
the existence of advertisements, of any kind, offering the property for rent or
other remuneration.
      2.   Violators shall be issued written citations containing a description
of the nature of the violation and the amount of fine levied in accordance with
the fee schedule for an infraction, provided that, such fine shall not be less
than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
      3.   The business license for the RV resort and/or other transient
lodging facility may be revoked, suspended, or denied renewal if three (3)
citations are issued within any twelve (12) month period. (Ord. 2017-02, 2-15-

occupant at their last known post office addresses as disclosed by the records
of the county assessor, or as otherwise ascertained, requiring such owner or

time limit given within the notice, the city may either pursue legal action
against him or correct the objectionable conditions, in which case it will
collect the costs of such correction by either charging the cost of correcting
violation against the property as a tax, or filing a court action for such
collections, in which case the person will also be assessed reasonable attorney
fees and court costs related to such action. Said notice shall also inform the
owner that his failure to correct the objectionable condition or request a
hearing within the time limits given shall constitute a waiver and consent by
him that the city and its agents may thereafter freely enter onto his property
to correct the condition.

pertinent to the question of whether or not the removal or abatement of the

occupant must make removal or other abatement of the objectionable objects or
conditions, if any. The owner or occupant shall be required to conform to the
decision of the city council within ten (10) days after service or mailing of a
copy of the decision, and the decision shall be deemed to be the modified
decision of the nuisance inspector, unless additional time is authorized by the

limit specified in said notice/written decision and in this chapter, relating
to the eradication of any nuisance, including destruction or removal of such
weeds, garbage, refuse, objects or structures, the nuisance inspector may
employ all necessary assistance to cause such objectionable objects or

failure to eradicate the nuisance by the date fixed for compliance shall
constitute a waiver and consent by him that thereafter the city and its agents
may freely enter onto his property to correct the condition. (Ord. 2001-04, 5-
16-2001)
4-1-3-4: ITEMIZED STATEMENT:

described in this chapter, the city may pursue a civil or criminal action
against a property owner who has committed a nuisance violation as determined
by the nuisance inspector. A nuisance violation shall be a class C misdemeanor,

days after the completion of the work of removal, after which the county
treasurer shall have the responsibility to provide for collection of the same.

of these costs, in which case reasonable attorney fees, interest and court
costs shall be awarded the city upon obtaining a judgment in the suit, in
addition to the costs of abatement.

by the nuisance inspector to be a fire hazard and who fails to implement

report the incident immediately to the Division of Animal Control, giving the
name and address of the person bitten and of the owner or custodian of the
biting animal, if available. Failure to provide such information or otherwise
assist the division to provide such information or otherwise assist the
division in discovering possible exposure to rabies or in ascertaining the
immunization of an animal shall be in violation of this chapter.
   D.   Vaccination; Certificate. Rabies vaccination is required for dogs and
cats. The owner of a dog or cat shall have said animal vaccinated within thirty
(30) days after it reaches the age of four months. Unvaccinated dogs or cats
over four (4) months of age acquired by the owner or brought into the
jurisdiction must be vaccinated within thirty (30) days. Every dog shall be
revaccinated thereafter every thirty-six (36) months, and every cat shall be
revaccinated thereafter every twelve (12) months with a modified rabies virus
vaccine approved by the division. This provision shall not apply to a
veterinarian temporarily maintaining on their premises animals owned by others.

to the five-day period may be disposed of pursuant to provisions of this
chapter.
   F.   Biting Animals. Management of biting animals shall be as follows:
      1.   A healthy dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person shall be confined
and observed at least daily for ten days from the date of bite, regardless of
vaccination status. Unless otherwise recommended by medical personnel, the
rabies vaccine shall not be administered during the observation period. Such
animals shall be evaluated by a veterinarian at the first sign of illness
during confinement. A veterinarian or animal control officer shall immediately
report any illness in the animal to the local health department. If signs
suggestive of rabies develop, a veterinarian or animal control officer shall
direct that the animal be euthanized, its head removed, and the head shipped
under refrigeration, not frozen, for examination of the brain by a laboratory
approved by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
      2.   If the dog, cat, or ferret shows no signs of rabies or illness
during the ten-day period, the veterinarian or animal control officer shall
direct that the unvaccinated animal be vaccinated against rabies at the owner's
expense before release to the owner. If a veterinarian is not available, the
animal may be released, but the owner shall have the animal vaccinated within
72 hours of release. If the dog, cat, or ferret was appropriately vaccinated
against rabies before the incident, the animal may be released from confinement
after the 10-day observation period with no further restrictions.
      3.   Any stray or unwanted dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person may be
euthanized immediately by a veterinarian or animal control officer and the head
submitted, as described in R386-702-12(2)(a) of the Utah Administrative Rules
for rabies examination. If the brain is negative by fluorescent-antibody
examination for rabies, one can assume that the saliva contained no virus, and
the person bitten need not be treated.
      4.   If a wild animal, including a raccoon, skunk, coyote, fox, or bat
and any carnivorous animal other than a domestic dog, cat, or ferret, bites or
scratches a person, the person or attending medical personnel shall notify an
animal control or law enforcement officer. A veterinarian, animal control
officer or representative of the Division of Wildlife Resources shall kill the
animal at once, without unnecessary damage to the head, and submit the brain,
as described in Subsection R386-702-12(2)(a) of the Utah Administrative Rules
for examination for evidence of rabies.
      5.   Any animal bitten or scratched by a wild, carnivorous animal or a
bat that is not available for testing shall be regarded as having been exposed
to rabies. The animal shall be placed in a strict quarantine for four months
for dogs and cats, or six months for ferrets.
      6.   For maximum protection of the public health, unvaccinated dogs,
cats, and ferrets bitten or scratched by a confirmed or suspected rabid animal
shall be euthanized immediately by a veterinarian or animal control officer. If
the owner is unwilling to have the animal euthanized, the animal control
officer shall order that the animal be held in strict isolation in the city
animal shelter at the owner's expense, for at least four months for dogs and
cats, and six months for ferrets. The animal shall be vaccinated one month
before being released. If any illness suggestive of rabies develops in the
animal, the veterinarian or animal control officer shall immediately report the
illness to the local health department and the animal control officer shall
direct that the animal be euthanized and the head shall be handled as described
in R386-702-12(2)(a).
      7.   Dogs, cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated and are bitten
by rabid animals, shall be revaccinated immediately by a veterinarian and
confined and observed by the animal's owner for 45 days. If any illness
suggestive of rabies develops in the animal, the owner shall report immediately
to the local health department and the animal shall be euthanized by a
veterinarian or animal control officer and the head shall be handled as
described in Subsection R386-702-12(2)(a).
      8.   Livestock exposed to a rabid animal and currently vaccinated with a
vaccine approved by the United States Department of Agriculture for that
species shall be revaccinated immediately by a veterinarian and observed by the
owner for 45 days. Unvaccinated livestock shall be slaughtered immediately. If
the owner is unwilling to have the animal slaughtered, the animal shall be kept

completed at the petitioner's sole expense, and in a form acceptable to the
city, the following:
      1.   A traffic impact study performed by a licensed engineer or other
professional qualified to conduct such a study, which study shall cover such
issues as the adequacy of the street width to service the needs of property
owners fronting on the street, overall traffic flow including future traffic in
light of projected city growth, fire and emergency access, and pedestrian and
other safety issues.

dedication of the street if the study shows that the street width, design or
manner of construction is not adequate to meet the needs of the public.
   D.   The city shall review the utility study and shall also review any city
staff recommendations with respect to utility services that would be dedicated
as lying within the proposed street dedication. The city may refuse the
application for dedication if the utility study or the staff recommendation
shows that the location and/or condition of the utility service lines are such
that by accepting the dedication of the utility service lines the city would be
incurring a substantial expense to ameliorate the same.
   E.   The city may also refuse the application for dedication if city staff
does not approve of the street, including any curb, gutter and/or sidewalk
dedicated with the street, and if the street fails to meet all other city
specifications and requirements for grading, construction, surfacing and
quality of streets except for the inclusion of sidewalks, curbs and gutters and
the width of the street.
   F.   In addition to the conditions set forth above, petitioner must prior to
final approval of the application for dedication of a private street or streets
agree in writing to and pay for all costs associated with bringing all street

constructed of three inches' (3") compacted hot mix asphalt installed in
accordance with the requirements of the standard drawings and specifications on
file in the city.
   A.   Basic Street Cross Section Standards: Requirements for the basic street
cross section configurations are shown in the standard drawings. Alternate road
cross sections may be used, if applicable safety and traffic standards are met
and approved by the LaVerkin City public works director.
   B.   Private Street Cross Section Standard: Private streets must be
constructed to public street standards.
   C.   Improvement Requirements:
      1.   Curb, Gutter And Sidewalk: Required curb, gutter, and sidewalk shall
be constructed in accordance with the standard drawings and specifications on
file in the city.
      2.   Driveways: Driveways shall be constructed in accordance with the
standard drawings and specifications on file in the city.
      3.   Pavement: All streets, public or private, shall be surfaced to
grade, with asphalt pavement, to the minimum width and thickness in accordance
with standard drawings and specifications on file in the city.
      4.   Fog Coat: Within thirty (30) days or after the asphalt has cured,
whichever comes first, a fog coat shall be applied to all streets within the
subdivision by the subdivider.
      5.   Street Lighting: Street lighting shall be provided on all public
streets. The construction shall be in accordance with the standard drawings and
specifications on file in the city.

the standard drawings. The LaVerkin City public works director may, with
justification, prohibit construction on any street.
      7.   Wheelchair Ramps: Wheelchair ramps shall be constructed at all
street intersections, when new construction occurs, in accordance with the
standard drawings, and federal ADA requirements. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)
   D.   Technical Design Requirements: The following requirements apply to
public and private streets:
      1.   Street Grades:
         a.   All street grades shall have a maximum of twelve percent (12%).
Minimum grade shall be 0.5 percent unless approved by the city engineer.
         b.   Maximum street grades may be increased to fifteen percent (15%)
and upon prior approval of the LaVerkin city council. Approval may be given
based upon evaluation of evidence submitted which shows a smaller amount of
disturbance to the existing terrain if larger percentages are used and result
in no significant decrease in safety features. Any approvals for increased
grades must be consistent with access requirements of fire apparatus as defined
by the fire department. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-3-2007)
      2.   Intersections:
         a.   Wherever possible, all street intersections shall be ninety
degree (90°) angles.
         b.   In the event an acute angle intersection is required, the
LaVerkin City public works director may require mitigation by realigning to
achieve a ninety degree (90°) intersection. At a minimum, this can be
accomplished by use of a fifty foot (50') section prior to the PC of the curve
or a landing area design in which a vehicle is brought ninety degrees (90°) to
the intersecting road. Other design approaches to mitigate the acute angle may
be required by LaVerkin City.
         c.   Intersections should not be located on or near sharp curves,
i.e., curves with radii close to AASHTO minimums. Intersections should be
located sufficient distance from all curves to provide proper sight distance
for vehicles on the intersecting road or driveway and on the through road.
         d.   New intersections with more than four (4) "legs" are not
permitted. For arterial access, only four-leg and "T" intersections are
permitted. When designing local road networks, four-leg, "T" and "L"
intersections are desired. The "L" intersection will only be permitted when the
street length, in either direction from the angle point, is three hundred feet
(300'), or less. Exceptions to these requirements may be granted by LaVerkin
City on a case by case basis. The developer must provide compelling
justification before deviations will be granted.
         e.   When designing local road networks, block lengths without an
intervening connector street shall not exceed eight hundred feet (800') in
length unless previous approval has been obtained from the LaVerkin City
representative. Cul-de-sacs are not included in this requirement.
         f.   New access locations created by development shall be unified
whenever possible to create the fewest number of access points onto arterials
or major collectors.
         g.   The intersection of two (2) local roads should be designed to
operate without a requirement for any traffic control device, whenever
possible.
         h.   Access to corner lots should be from the lesser classified road,
at greatest distance possible from the intersection.
         i.   Direct access will not be allowed for parking, loading, or
driveway areas that require backing maneuvers onto arterial streets.
      3.   Intersection Spacing: The minimum distance between intersections on
low volume streets is one hundred fifty feet (150'); for the minor and major
collector streets, the minimum distance is two hundred fifty feet (250').
Minimum distance measurements are centerline to centerline. The minimum spacing
requirement on arterials shall be based upon current and projected turning
movement volumes at the intersections in question. The LaVerkin City public
works director shall review and give final approval to any intersection
requests on arterials in which the spacing would be less than four hundred feet
(400') apart.
      4.   Driveway Spacing: Driveways shall be spaced far enough apart so that
the traffic stopped to make left turns at one intersection does not interfere
with traffic movements at the adjacent intersection.
      5.   Cul-De-Sac: A minimum centerline radius of fifty feet (50') shall be
maintained on all cul-de-sacs.
      6.   Sidewalks: Sidewalks on all urban streets shall be concrete,
constructed to city specifications.
         a.   In industrial and manufacturing areas, road pavement may be
widened ten feet (10') in lieu of concrete sidewalks if approved by LaVerkin
City.
         b.   Sidewalk in areas of high pedestrian flow shall require greater
width as determined by LaVerkin City.
      7.   Curb And Gutter:
         a.   High Water Flows: Areas of high water flow may require larger
gutter capacity than shown on the standard drawing. High back or wedge back
curb may be used in accordance with standard drawings and with direction from
the LaVerkin City representative. Sidewalk depth shall be at least six inches
(6").
         b.   Curb Corners: All curb corners shall have a radius of not less
than fifteen feet (15'); at intersections involving collector or major streets,
of not less than twenty five feet (25'); in industrial areas, not less than
twenty five feet (25').
      8.   Design Speed: The design of geometric features such as horizontal
and vertical alignment will depend on the design speed selected for each
street. The design speed is primarily determined by the street function and is
the maximum speed for safe and comfortable operation of a vehicle. The use of
design speeds other than those listed below must be approved by LaVerkin City,
who may decide that the speed provided in this section be reduced to that which
is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having due regard to the
actual and potential hazards. Local streets designed for thirty (30) miles per
hour shall be posted at twenty five (25) miles per hour. Minor collectors
designed for thirty five (35) miles per hour shall be posted at thirty (30)
miles per hour.
      9.   Clear Sight Distance At Intersections: At intersections, adequate,
clear sight distance should be provided to permit drivers entering the higher
order street from a driveway or stop controlled intersection to see approaching
traffic from a long enough distance to allow them to decide when to safely
enter the higher order street and complete their turning maneuvers in advance
of approaching traffic. Clear sight distance, for both left and right turning
vehicles, shall be in accordance with the following AASHTO guidelines:
 
   Through Street Design Spe   Sight Distance
                               
      20 mph                   230 feet
      25 mph                   290 feet
      30 mph                   375 feet
 
      10.   Vertical Alignment:
         a.   Vertical curves shall be provided in all changes in grade where
the algebraic difference is one percent (1%) or greater.
         b.   Longitudinal street grades shall not be less than one-half
percent (1/2%) unless adequate alternative street drainage is provided, nor
more than twelve percent (12%), except as allowed in this chapter.
         c.   Vertical curve stopping sight distance design shall utilize
criteria recommended by the latest edition of the AASHTO publication.
         d.   Minimum cross slope from street crown shall be two percent (2%)
unless otherwise approved by LaVerkin City.
         e.   Vertical alignment with the intersection is also of special
nature, and design alternatives may be required. As a guideline, the approach
area where vehicles stop while waiting to enter an intersection shall not
exceed five percent (5%) from the gutter line of the street being intersected
for a distance of fifty feet (50'), though a range of fifty feet (50') to one
hundred feet (100') is more desirable. This applies to all intersections,
except those where both intersecting streets are minor or major collectors. In
this situation, the landing area for a minor collector which is controlled by a
stop or yield sign shall be designed for a grade of two (2) to three percent
(3%) for a distance of one hundred feet (100').
      11.   Safe Stopping Sight Distance: The minimum sight distance or length
of roadway ahead visible to the driver is to be provided for through traffic
traveling at, or near, the design speed to stop before reaching a stationary
object in its path shall comply with the requirements set forth below (AASHTO
guidelines):
 
   Design Spe   Required Distance
                
      20 m      125 feet
      25 m      150 feet
      30 m      200 feet
 
      12.   Horizontal Curves: The recommended minimum centerline radii for
horizontal curves are outlined below:
 
   Curve Radius In Feet
             
      2      185 feet
      3      310 feet
 
      13.   Deceleration Lanes:
         a.   Deceleration lanes may be required on streets in conjunction with
driveways and/or intersections adjacent to a proposed development. They are
specifically required when all of the following factors are determined to
apply:
            (1)   At least five thousand (5,000) vehicles per day are using, or
are expected to be using, the street;
            (2)   The 85th percentile traffic speed on the street is a least
thirty five (35) miles per hour; or forty five (45) miles per hour for a two
(2) lane (1 lane each direction) roadway; and
            (3)   At least fifty (50) vehicles will be making right turns into
the driveway during a one hour peak period.
         b.   The lane lengths for a deceleration lane shall be determined on a
case by case basis and must receive prior approval of LaVerkin City and/or
UDOT. In addition to the above guidelines, deceleration lanes may be required
in connection with the results of a traffic impact study.
      14.   Alignment And Continuity; Off Site:
         a.   Normally, off site pavement construction requires asphalt
concrete paving to the right of way centerline plus ten feet (10'). When
asphalt pavement is existing, the developer's engineer may submit to the
LaVerkin City representative sufficient information prepared by a professional
engineer to indicate vertical and horizontal alignment is maintained and
adequate drainage is provided for. The developer may be required to replace all
or any portion of existing roadway, in a manner that two-way traffic can be
maintained without the use of potentially hazardous alignment transitions
(vertical or horizontal) and in a manner to ensure that adequate drainage is
provided for. As a minimum, there shall be twenty five feet (25') of paving to
accommodate through traffic. When off site pavement construction consists of
improvement to the right of way centerline (approximately), deceleration and
acceleration transition tapers shall be placed at each end of the improvements.
The transition tapers shall be designed and constructed based upon the posted
speed zoning.
         b.   When paving for partial street construction, the edges of the
pavement are to be protected by placing a minimum two feet (2') of aggregate
base material beyond the edge of pavement matching the pavement grade.
         c.   Wherever partial street construction is required, grades shall be
set for the future curb line and approved by the LaVerkin City representative.
The future grades shall be compatible with the curb and centerline grades for
the partial street construction. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)

7-3-18: CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND EQUIPMENT:
The methods employed in performing the work, all equipment, tools and
machinery, and other appliances used in handling the materials and executing
the work shall be the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor shall
make such changes in the methods employed and in the equipment used as are
necessary whenever the concrete being installed does not meet the
specifications herein established. These methods shall include, but are not
limited to, the following:
   A.   General Concrete Placement: Generally concrete shall be installed as
follows:
      1.   Forms: Forms shall be substantially built and adequately braced to
withstand the liquid weight of concrete. All linings, studding, walling and
bracing shall be such as to prevent bulging, spreading, or loss of true
alignment while pouring and displacement of concrete while setting.
      2.   Preparations:
         a.   Before batching and placing concrete, all equipment for mixing
and transporting the concrete shall be cleaned. All debris and ice shall be
removed from the places to be occupied by the concrete. Forms shall be oiled
with a form-release agent and masonry filler units that will be in contact with
concrete shall be well drenched with water except in freezing weather. The
reinforcement shall be thoroughly cleaned of ice or other coatings. Water shall
be removed from spaces to receive concrete.
         b.   When placing concrete on earth surfaces, the surfaces shall be
free from frost, ice, mud and water. When the subgrade is dry soil or pervious
material, it shall be sprayed with water prior to the placing of concrete or
shall be covered with waterproof sheathing paper or a plastic membrane. No
concrete shall be placed until the surfaces have been inspected and approved.
      3.   Concrete Mixing:
         a.   The concrete shall be mixed until there is a uniform distribution
of the materials. Sufficient water shall be used in concrete in which
reinforcement is to be embedded, to produce a mixture which will flow
sluggishly when worked and which, at the same time, can be conveyed from the
mixer to the forms without separation of the coarse aggregate from the mortar.
In no case shall the quantity of water used be sufficient to cause the
collection of a surplus in the forms.
         b.   Ready mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered in accordance
with the requirements set forth in specifications for ready mixed concrete ASTM
C 94. Concrete shall be delivered and deposited in its final position within
sixty (60) minutes after adding the cement and water to the mixture.
      4.   Depositing:
         a.   Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practical in its final
position to avoid segregation due to rehandling or flowing. The concrete
placing shall be carried on at such a rate that the concrete is at all times
plastic and flows readily into the corners of forms and reinforcing bars. No
concrete that has partially hardened or been contaminated by foreign material
shall be deposited in the work, nor shall retempered concrete be used.
         b.   All concrete in structures shall be compacted by means of high
frequency internal vibrators of approved type and design during the operation
of placing, and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement and embedded
fixtures and into the corners of the forms to prevent "honeycombing". Care must
be taken not to overuse vibrators causing separation of cement and aggregates.
      5.   Finishing: After the concrete for slabs has been brought to the
established grade and screeded, it shall be worked with a magnesium float and
then given a light "broom" finish. In no case shall dry cement or a mixture of
dry cement and sand be sprinkled on the surface to absorb moisture or hasten
hardening. Surface edges of all slabs shall be rounded to a radius of one-
fourth inch (1/4") to one-half inch (1/2") with standard concrete finishing
tools.
      6.   Curing And Protection:
         a.   As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent
damage, the finished surface shall be kept moist for seven (7) days, or a
chemical curing agent may be used to prevent the concrete from premature
drying.
         b.   The freshly finished surface shall be protected from hot sun and
drying winds until it can be sprinkled or covered as herein specified. The
concrete surface must not be damaged or pitted by rain. The contractor shall
provide and use, when necessary, sufficient tarpaulins to cover completely all
sections that have been placed within the preceding twelve (12) hours. The
contractor shall erect and maintain suitable barriers to protect the finished
surface. Any section damaged from traffic, weather or other causes occurring
prior to its official acceptance by the city shall be repaired or replaced by
the contractor.
      7.   Weather Limitations: No concrete shall be poured where the air
temperature is lower than thirty five degrees Fahrenheit (35°F) unless approved
by the LaVerkin City representative. When there is likelihood of freezing
during the curing period, the concrete shall be protected by means of an
insulating covering to prevent freezing of the concrete for a period of not
less than seven (7) days after placing. Equipment for protecting the concrete
from freezing shall be available at the job site prior to placing concrete.
Particular care shall be exercised to protect edges and exposed corners from
freezing.
   B.   Concrete Reinforcement Installation: Concrete reinforcement shall be
installed as follows:
      1.   Bending: Reinforcing bars shall be accurately formed to the
dimensions indicated on the plans. Bends for stirrups and ties shall be made
around a pin having a diameter not less than two (2) times the minimum
thickness of the bar. Bends for other bars shall be made around a pin having a
diameter not less than six (6) times the minimum thickness of the bar, except
that for bars larger than one inch (1"), the pin shall be not less than eight
(8) times the minimum thickness of the bar.
      2.   Splicing: Splicing of bars at points other than as shown on the
plans will be permitted only by permission of the LaVerkin City representative.
Splices of reinforcement at points of maximum stress shall be avoided wherever
possible, and shall be staggered when used. The minimum overlap for a lapped
splice shall be as shown on the approved structural drawings, or twenty four
(24) bar diameter if not called out, but not less than eighteen inches (18").
      3.   Placing: All reinforcing bars shall be placed accurately in the
position shown on the plans, and shall be securely held in position by annealed
iron wire ties of not less than 16-gauge or suitable clips at intersection and
supported by metal supports, spacers, chairs or hangers, in such a manner that
there will not be any displacement while placing concrete.
      4.   Embedment And Protection: All reinforcing steel shall be protected
by concrete embedment and protective cover as shown in the following table,
such cover in each case being the shortest distance between the face of the
form or concrete surface, and the nearest edge or face of the reinforcement.
   REINFORCING BAR CLEARANCE
 
   Location Of Reinforcement                            Cover
Bottom bars, where concrete is deposited against ground Not less than 3 inches
without use of forms
Main bars, where concrete is exposed to the weather, or Not less than 2 inches
exposed to the ground but placed in forms
Bars in slabs and walls not exposed to the ground or    Not less than 1 inch
weather
 
   C.   Curb And Gutter And Sidewalk Concrete Placement: The concrete shall be
placed either by an approved slip form/extrusion machine, by the formed method,
or by a combination of those methods. Curb and gutter shall be placed as
follows:
      1.   Machine Placement: The slip form/extrusion machine approved shall be
so designed as to place, spread, consolidate, screed, and finish the concrete
in one complete pass in such a manner that a minimum of hand finishing will be
necessary to provide a dense and homogeneous concrete section. The machine
shall shape, vibrate, and/or extrude the concrete for the full width and depth
of the concrete section being placed. It shall be operated with as nearly a
continuous forward movement as possible. All operations of mixing, delivery,
and spreading concrete shall be so coordinated as to provide uniform progress,
with stopping and starting of the machine held to a minimum.
      2.   Formed Method:
         a.   The forms shall be of wood, metal, or other suitable material
that is straight and free from warp, having sufficient strength to resist the
pressure of the concrete without displacement and sufficient tightness to
prevent the leakage of mortar. Flexible or rigid forms of proper curvature may
be used for curves having a radius of one hundred feet (100'), or less.
Division plates shall be metal.
         b.   The front and back forms shall extend for the full depth of the
concrete. All forms shall be braced and staked so that they remain in both
horizontal and vertical alignment until their removal. They shall be cleaned
and coated with an approved form-release agent before concrete is placed
against them.
         c.   The concrete shall be deposited into the forms without
segregation and then tamped and spaded or mechanically vibrated for thorough
consolidation. Front and back forms shall be removed without damage to the
concrete after it has set.
      3.   Finishing:
         a.   The plastic concrete shall be finished smooth, if necessary, by
means of a wood or magnesium float and then given a final surface texture using
a light broom or burlap drag. Concrete that is adjacent to forms and formed
joints shall be edged with a standard jointer or edging tool to the dimensions
shown on the plans. The top, face, and flow line of the curb, and the top of
the apron on driveway aprons, shall be finished true to line and grade and
without any irregularities of surface noticeable to the eye.
         b.   The gutter shall not pond water when tested by water flow and no
portion of the surface of the curb and gutter shall depart more than one-fourth
inch (1/4") from a straight edge, ten feet (10') in length, placed on the curb
parallel to the centerline of the street, nor shall any part of the exposed
surface present a wavy appearance.
      4.   Jointing:
         a.   Contraction Joints:
            (1)   Transverse weakened plane contraction joints shall be
constructed at right angles to the curb line at intervals not exceeding twelve
feet (12') for curb and gutter, and not to exceed five feet (5') for sidewalks.
Joint depth shall at least be one-half (1/2) of the cross section of the
concrete. Generally, surface areas shall not exceed fifty (50) square feet
without contraction joints unless otherwise approved by LaVerkin City's
representative.
            (2)   Contraction joints may be sawed, hand formed, or made by
placing one-half inch (1/2") thick division plates in the form work. Sawing
shall be done within twenty four (24) hours after the concrete has set to
prevent the formation of uncontrolled cracking. The joints may be hand formed
either by using a narrow or triangular jointing tool, or a thin metal blade to
impress a plane of weakness into the plastic concrete, or by inserting one-
eighth inch (1/8") thick steel strips into the plastic concrete temporarily.
Steel strips shall be withdrawn before final finishing of the concrete. Where
division plates are used to make contraction joints, the plates shall be
removed after the concrete has set while the forms are still in place.
            (3)   Expansion joints in a slip formed curb and gutter shall be
constructed with an appropriate hand tool by raking or sawing through partially
set concrete for the full depth and width of the section. The cut shall be only
wide enough to permit a snug fit for the joint filler. After the filler is
placed, open areas adjacent to the filler shall be filled with concrete and
then troweled and edged.
            (4)   Alternately, an expansion joint may be installed by removing
a short section of freshly extruded curb and gutter, immediately installing
temporary holding forms, placing the expansion joint filler, and replacing and
reconsolidating the concrete that was removed. Contaminated concrete shall be
discarded.
         b.   Expansion Joints: Expansion joints for curb and gutter shall be
constructed at right angles to the curb line at no greater than one hundred
fifty foot (150') intervals for curb and gutter, at immovable structures and at
points of curvature for short radius curves. Spacing for sidewalk jointing
shall not exceed twenty feet (20'). Filler material for expansion joints shall
conform to requirements of ASTM D 994, D 1751, or D 1752 and shall be furnished
in a single one-half inch (1/2") thick piece for the full depth and width of
the joint.
         c.   Other Jointing:
            (1)   Construction joints may be either butt or expansion type
joints. Curbs and gutters constructed adjacent to existing concrete shall have
the same type of joints as in the existing concrete with similar spacing;
however, contraction joint spacing shall not exceed twelve feet (12').
            (2)   A silicone joint sealer as defined in ASTM C 962 shall be
applied to all form plate expansion joints. The silicone joint sealer shall be
applied under pressure to a depth of not less than two inches (2") from the
outside surface of the curb and gutter.
      5.   Protection:
         a.   At all times during the construction of the project, the
contractor shall have materials available at the site to protect the surface of
the plastic concrete against rain. These materials shall consist of waterproof
paper or plastic sheeting. For slip form construction, materials such as wood
planks or forms to protect the edges shall also be required.
         b.   When concrete is being placed in cold weather and the temperature
may be expected to drop below thirty five degrees Fahrenheit (35°F), suitable
protection shall be provided to keep the concrete from freezing until it is at
least seven (7) days old. Concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and
replaced at the contractor's expense.
      6.   Curing: Concrete shall be cured for at least three (3) days after
placement to protect it against loss of moisture, rapid temperature change, and
mechanical injury. Moist burlap, waterproof paper, polyethylene sheeting,
liquid membrane curing compound, or a combination thereof may be used as the
curing material. Membrane curing shall not be permitted in frost affected areas
when the concrete will be exposed to deicing chemicals within thirty (30) days
after completion of the curing period.
      7.   Backfilling: After at least three (3) days after placement and the
forms have been removed from the concrete, the contractor shall backfill to the
line and elevation as shown on the drawings or as required by the LaVerkin City
representative. This time may be shortened if it can be demonstrated that the
placement has reached design strength.
      8.   Concrete Repair: In lieu of removing and replacing concrete with
minor cracks, the LaVerkin City representative may direct the contractor to
repair the affected sections by sawing, cleaning, and sealing the cracks. All
cracks repaired shall be sealed with a polyurethane TTS-230 type II crack
filler. Where modifications are to be made to existing concrete, the edges to
be poured against shall be sawed and the new concrete shall be edged with a
standard edging tool.
      9.   Weather Limitations: No concrete shall be poured when there is
likelihood of freezing. During the curing period, the concrete shall be
protected by means of an insulating covering to prevent freezing of the
concrete for a period of not less than seven (7) days after placing. Equipment
for protecting the concrete from freezing shall be available at the job site
prior to placing concrete. Particular care shall be exercised to protect edges
and exposed corners from freezing. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)
7-3-19: QUALITY CONTROL:
The placement of concrete base materials under curb, gutter, and sidewalk shall
conform to these standards. All concrete and base materials shall be placed in
accordance with these standards and tested as follows. These are minimum
requirements and additional testing may be required.
   A.   Concrete Testing: Minimum testing of the concrete shall be as follows:
      1.   Mix design certification: One per job. Testing shall be according to
the latest ASTM standards.
      2.   Compressive strength tests: One set of four (4) cylinders for each
fifty (50) cubic yards of concrete placed. Tests shall be according to ASTM C
39.
      3.   Air entrainment: Tested at beginning of load placement until two (2)
consecutive tests pass. Others shall be taken as required. Tests shall be
according to ASTM C 231.
      4.   Slump tests: Tested at beginning of load placement until two (2)
consecutive tests pass. Others shall be taken as required. Tests shall be
according to ASTM C 143.
   B.   Concrete Base Material Testing: Minimum testing of the curb, gutter and
sidewalk base materials (both pit run and road base materials) shall be as
follows:
      1.   Gradation tests: One test per one thousand (1,000) linear feet of
curb and gutter and one test per four thousand (4,000) square feet of a
combination of sidewalk and driveway, or fraction thereof. The sieve analysis
shall be according to ASTM C 136, C 117.
      2.   Soil proctor: One determination of each source of base course as
necessary to provide required compaction testing. Test shall be according to
ASTM D 1557, method A or D (modified proctor).
      3.   Moisture density tests: One test per three hundred (300) linear feet
of curb and gutter and one test per three hundred (300) linear feet of sidewalk
or fraction thereof. Moisture content shall be at plus or minus two percent
(±2%) for tests to pass and shall be maintained until the concrete is poured.
Tests shall be according to ASTM D 1556 or D 2922 and D 3017.
      4.   Thickness:
         a.   One random boring or test hole per two hundred (200) linear feet
of curb and gutter and one random boring or test hole per two hundred (200)
linear feet of sidewalk or fraction thereof. If sufficient inspection has been
made by a LaVerkin City representative to verify required thickness. The
representative may waive thickness testing.
         b.   No single measured thickness shall be less than the required
thickness.
         c.   Testing documentation shall fully address the requirements of
these standards.
   C.   Acceptance:
      1.   A total of four (4) concrete test cylinders shall be taken at time
of pouring. One "early warning" cylinder shall be broken at seven (7) days. Two
(2) cylinders shall be broken at twenty eight (28) days. If the average of the
two (2) 28-day breaks is below specification, the concrete may be rejected
unless retests prove otherwise. At the contractor's option, the fourth cylinder
may be broken at twenty eight (28) days, if additional test results are needed
to meet the specification. Or, it can be held and broken at fifty six (56) days
for the same reason.
      2.   Concrete with a compressive strength below the required strength
shall be evaluated for capabilities necessary to the integrity of the
structure. At this point, the "hold" cylinder may be broken or other
specialized tests, such as a spectrum analysis, may be required. The LaVerkin
City representative shall make the final decision. If additional tests are
required to determine if strength tests are representative they shall be
performed by coring in accordance with ASTM C 42 method or other acceptable
nondestructive methods. The retested strength shall be the average of three (3)
cores or other means. All costs incurred in resampling and retesting shall be
paid by the contractor.
      3.   Any curb, gutter, or sidewalk base material determined not to comply
with these standards, shall either be removed and replaced or reworked until
compliance is obtained. Any costs for testing rework shall be paid for by the
contractor. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)

The purpose of this article is to establish uniform guidelines to determine
when a traffic impact study (TIS) is required and how the study is to be
conducted. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)
7-3A-2: DEFINITIONS:
A "TIS" is a specialized study of the impacts that a certain type and size of
development will have on the surrounding transportation system. It is
specifically concerned with the generation, distribution, and assignment of
traffic to and from the "new development". The term "new development" also
includes properties that are being redeveloped. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)
7-3A-3: WHEN REQUIRED:
A TIS shall be required for all new developments, or additions to existing
developments, which generate one hundred (100) or more trips total in and out
vehicular movements, during the morning or afternoon peak hour. The specific
analysis requirements, and level of detail, are determined by the following
requirements:
   A.   Category I:
      1.   Developments which generate one hundred (100) or more peak hour
trips, but fewer than five hundred (500) trips, during the morning or afternoon
peak hour. In addition to the above threshold requirement, a category I TIS may
also be required for any of the following reasons:
         a.   The existence of any current traffic situations or concerns in
the local area such as, but not limited to, an offset intersection or a high
number of traffic accidents.
         b.   The sensitivity of the adjacent neighborhoods or other areas
where the public may perceive an adverse impact.
         c.   The proximity of site driveways to other driveways or
intersections.
         d.   Other specific problems or concerns that may be aggravated by the
proposed development.
      2.   The study horizon shall be limited to the opening year of the
development.
      3.   The minimum study area shall include site access drives and adjacent
signalized intersections and/or major unsignalized street intersections.
   B.   Category II: Developments that generate from five hundred (500) to one
thousand (1,000) peak hour trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour. The
study horizon shall include both the opening year of the development and five
(5) years after opening. The minimum study area shall include the site access
drives and all signalized intersections and/or major unsignalized street
intersections within one-half (1/2) mile of the development.
   C.   Category III: Developments that generate above one thousand (1,000)
peak hour trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour. The study horizon
shall include the opening year of the development, five (5) years after opening
and ten (10) years after opening. The minimum study area shall include the site
access drives and all signalized intersections and/or major unsignalized street
intersections within one-half (1/2) mile of the development.
   D.   Initial Work Activity: The LaVerkin City representative makes the final
decision on requiring a TIS and determining whether the study falls within
category I, II, or III. In addition to the above requirement thresholds, a TIS
may be required for:
      1.   Proposed property rezones; or
      2.   When the original TIS is more than two (2) years old; or
      3.   Where the proposed traffic volumes increase by more than ten percent
(10%).
   E.   Vehicular Trips: A developer, or their agent, shall first estimate the
number of vehicular trips to be generated by the proposed development to
determine if a TIS may be required and the applicable category. LaVerkin City's
representative must give concurrence on the number of trips to be generated by
the proposed development. The developer may, if desired, request LaVerkin
City's representative to assist in estimating the number of trips for
determining whether a TIS is required for the proposed development.
   F.   TIS Required: LaVerkin City's representative shall next make a ruling
whether a TIS is required and what the study category shall be. As previously
outlined, LaVerkin City's representative may make an independent finding that a
TIS is required. If a study is required, the developer shall have a draft table
of contents for the TIS prepared for review and approval by LaVerkin City's
representative. The table of contents will be sufficiently detailed to explain
the proposed area of influence for the study, intersections and roadways to be
analyzed, and level of detail for gathering of traffic volume information and
preparing the level of service analyses. There shall also be included in the
draft a proposed trip distribution for site traffic. After approval of the
draft table of contents and trip distribution by LaVerkin City's
representative, the actual TIS work activities may begin.
   G.   TIS Scope Of Work: The traffic impact study scope of work agreement
between engineer and developer shall conform to the preapproved draft table of
contents. The findings, conclusions, and recommendations contained within the
TIS document shall be prepared in accordance with appropriate professional
civil engineering canons. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)
7-3A-4: QUALIFICATIONS FOR PREPARING TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY DOCUMENTS:
The TIS shall be conducted and prepared under the direction of a professional
civil engineer licensed to practice in the state of Utah. The subject engineer
shall have special training and experience in traffic engineering and be a
member of the institute of transportation engineers (ITE). (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-
2006)
7-3A-5: ANALYSIS APPROACH AND METHODS:
The traffic study approach and methods shall be guided by the following
criteria:
   A.   Study Area: The minimum study area shall be determined by project type
and size in accordance with the criteria previously outlined. The extent of the
study area may be either enlarged, or decreased, depending on special
conditions as determined by LaVerkin City.
   B.   Study Horizon Years: The study horizon years shall be determined by
project type and size, in accordance with the criteria previously outlined.
   C.   Analysis Time Period:
      1.   Both the morning and afternoon weekday peak hours shall be analyzed,
unless the proposed project is expected to generate no trips, or a very low
number of trips, during either the morning or evening peak periods. If this is
the case, the requirement to analyze one or both of these periods may be waived
by LaVerkin City.
      2.   Where the peak traffic hour in the study area occurs during a
different time period than the normal morning or afternoon peak travel periods
(for example midday), or occurs on a weekend, or if the proposed project has
unusual peaking characteristics, these additional peak hours shall also be
analyzed.
   D.   Seasonal Adjustments: When directed by LaVerkin City's representative,
the traffic volumes for the analysis hours shall be adjusted for the peak
season, in cases where seasonal traffic data is available.
   E.   Data Collection Requirements: All data shall be collected in accordance
with the latest edition of the "ITE Manual Of Traffic Engineering Studies", or
as directed by LaVerkin City's representative.
      1.   Turning Movement Counts: Manual turning movement counts shall be
obtained for all existing cross street intersections to be analyzed during the
morning and afternoon peak periods. Turning movement counts may be required
during other periods as directed by LaVerkin City. Available turning movement
counts may be extrapolated a maximum of two (2) years with the concurrence of
LaVerkin City's representative.
      2.   Daily Traffic Volumes: The current and projected daily traffic
volumes shall be presented in the report. If available, daily count data from
the local agencies may be extrapolated a maximum of two (2) years with the
concurrence of LaVerkin City's representative. Where daily count data is not
available, mechanical counts will be required at locations agreed upon.
      3.   Accident Data: Traffic accident data shall be obtained for the most
current three (3) year period available.
      4.   Roadway And Intersection Geometrics: Roadway geometric information
shall be obtained. This includes, but is not limited to, roadway width, number
of lanes, turning lanes, vertical grade, location of nearby driveways, and lane
configuration at intersections.
      5.   Traffic Control Devices: The location and type of traffic controls
shall be identified.
   F.   Trip Generation: The latest edition of ITE's trip generation shall be
used for selecting trip generation rates. Other rates may be used with the
approval of the LaVerkin City representative in cases where trip generation
does not include trip rates for a specific land use category, or includes only
limited data, or where local trip rates have been shown to differ from the ITE
rates.
      1.   Site traffic shall be generated for daily, A.M. and P.M. peak hour
periods. Adjustments made for "passer by" and "mixed use" traffic volumes shall
follow the methodology outlined in the latest edition of the "ITE Trip
Generation Manual". A "passer by" traffic volume discount for commercial
centers shall not exceed twenty five percent (25%) unless approved by LaVerkin
City's representative.
      2.   A trip generation table shall be prepared showing proposed land use,
trip rates, and vehicle trips for daily and peak hour periods and appropriate
traffic volume adjustments, if applicable.
   G.   Trip Distribution And Assignment: Projected trips shall be distributed
and added to the projected nonsite traffic on the roadways and intersection
under study. The specific assumptions and data sources used in deriving trip
distribution and assignment shall be documented in the report. Future traffic
volumes shall be estimated using information from transportation models, or
applying an annual growth rate to the baseline traffic volumes. The future
traffic volumes shall be representative of the horizon year for project
development.
      1.   In addition, any nearby proposed "on-line" development projects
shall be taken into consideration when forecasting future traffic volumes. The
increase in traffic from proposed "on-line" projects shall be compared to the
increase in traffic by applying an annual growth rate.
      2.   If modeling information is unavailable, the greatest traffic
increase from either the "on-line" developments, the application of an annual
growth rate, or a combination of an annual growth rate and "on-line"
developments, shall be used to forecast the future traffic volumes.
      3.   The site generated traffic shall be assigned to the street network
in the study area based on the approved trip distribution percentages. The site
traffic shall be combined with the forecasted traffic volumes to show the total
traffic conditions estimated at development completion. A "figure" will be
required showing daily and peak period turning movement volumes for each
traffic study intersection. In addition, a "figure" shall be prepared showing
the baseline volumes with site generated traffic added to the street network.
This "figure" shall be prepared showing the baseline volumes with site
generated traffic added to the street network. This "figure" will represent
site specific traffic impacts to existing conditions.
   H.   Capacity Analysis:
      1.   Level of service (LOS) shall be computed for signalized and
unsignalized intersections in accordance with the latest edition of the
"Highway Capacity Manual". The intersection LOS shall be calculated for each of
the following conditions (if applicable):
         a.   Existing peak hour traffic volumes ("figure" required).
         b.   Existing peak hour traffic volumes including site generated
traffic ("figure" required).
         c.   Future traffic volumes not including site traffic ("figure"
required).
         d.   Future traffic volumes including site traffic ("figure"
required).
         e.   LOS results for each traffic volume scenario ("table" required).
      2.   The LOS table shall include LOS results for A.M. and P.M. peak
periods if applicable. The table shall show LOS conditions with corresponding
vehicle delays for signalized intersections, and LOS conditions for the
critical movements at unsignalized intersections. For signalized intersections,
the LOS conditions and average vehicle delay shall be provided for each
approach and the intersection as a whole.
      3.   Unless otherwise directed by the LaVerkin City representative, the
capacity analysis for existing signalized intersections shall be conducted
using the "Highway Capacity Manual" planning method for each study horizon
year. When directed by the LaVerkin City representative, the capacity analysis
shall be conducted using the operational analysis method.
      4.   If an operational capacity analysis method is used for existing
signalized intersections, it shall include existing phasing, timing, splits,
and cycle lengths as observed and measured during the peak hour traffic
periods.
      5.   The "Highway Capacity Manual" methodology shall be used for
unsignalized intersections.
      6.   If the new development is scheduled to be completed in phases, the
TIS will, if directed by LaVerkin City's representative, include an LOS
analysis for each separate development phase in addition to the TIS for each
horizon year. The incremental increases in site traffic from each phase shall
be included in the LOS analysis for each preceding year of development
completion. A "figure" will be required for each horizon year of phased
development.
   I.   Traffic Signal Needs: A traffic signal needs study shall be conducted
for all new proposed signals for the base year. If the warrants are not met for
the base year, they should be evaluated for each year in the five (5) year
horizon.
   J.   Accident Analysis: An analysis of three (3) year accident data shall be
conducted to determine if the level of safety will deteriorate due to the
addition of site traffic.
   K.   Speed Considerations: Vehicle speed is used to estimate safe stopping
and cross corner sight distances. In general, the posted speed limit is
representative of the 85th percentile speed and may be used to calculate safe
stopping and cross corner sight distances.
   L.   Improvement Analysis: The roadways and intersections within the study
area shall be analyzed, with and without the proposed development to identify
any projected impacts concerning level of service and safety.
   M.   Certification: The TIS shall be prepared under the supervision of a
professional civil engineer registered in the state of Utah. The report shall
be sealed and signed. (Ord. 2006-23, 7-5-2006)

that a minimum amount of interference or interruption of street traffic will
result. Inconvenience to residents and businesses fronting on public streets
shall be minimized. Suitable, adequate, and sufficient barricades shall be
available and used where necessary to prevent accidents involving property or
persons. Barricades must be in place until all of the excavator's equipment is
removed from site and excavation has been backfilled and proper temporary
gravel surface is in place. From sunset to sunrise, all barricades and
excisions must be clearly outlined by acceptable warning lights, lanterns,
flares and other devices. Police and fire departments shall be notified at
least twenty four (24) hours in advance of any planned excavation requiring
street closures or detour.
   B.   Notification: Prior to any construction in front of driveways, the
contractor shall notify the property owner twenty four (24) hours in advance.
Inconvenience caused by construction across driveways and sidewalks shall be
kept to a minimum by restoring the serviceability within twenty four (24)
hours, or as otherwise approved by the LaVerkin City representative. If it is
necessary to leave open excavation for a long period of time the contractor
shall provide structurally adequate steel plates to bridge the excavation.
(Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-5: PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF PROPERTY AND LANDSCAPE:
   A.   Preservation: The contractor shall be responsible for the preservation
of all public and private property and shall protect carefully from disturbance
or damage all land monuments and property marks until the LaVerkin City
representative has witnessed or otherwise referenced their location and shall
not move them until directed.
   B.   Restoration: Public or private property damaged on account of a
contractor through direct or indirect injury, including any act, omission,
neglect, defective work or materials, misconduct in his manner or method of
executing the work, or in consequence of the nonexecution thereof by the
contractor, shall be restored, at no cost to LaVerkin City. Such restoration
shall be to a condition similar or equal to that existing before such damage or
injury was done, by repairing, rebuilding, or otherwise restoring as may be
directed, or he shall make good such damage or injury in an acceptable manner.
Said responsibility shall not be released until the project shall have been
completed and accepted.
   C.   Dumping: The contractor shall not dump spoil or waste material on
private property without first obtaining from the owner written permission for
such dumping. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-6: RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES:
   A.   Relocation: An excavator shall not interfere with any existing utility
without the written consent of the city council and without advance notice to
the owner of the utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing
utility, it shall be done by its owner unless the owner otherwise directs. No
utility, whether owned by the city or by a private enterprise, shall be moved
to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the
permittee or an expressly written agreement is made whereby the utility owner
and the excavator make other arrangements relating to such cost.
   B.   Protection: The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or
otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in
any way affected by the excavation work, and shall do everything necessary to
support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across the work.
   C.   Liability: In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or
apparatus should be damaged they shall be repaired by the agency or person
owning them, but the utility owner shall be reimbursed for the expense of such
repairs by the permittee, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement
or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure. It is the intent of
this chapter that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to
substructures, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
substructure damage and such assumption of liability shall be deemed a
contractual obligation, which the permittee accepts upon acceptance of an
excavation permit. The city need not be made a party to any action because of
this chapter.
   D.   Permittee Responsibility: The permittee shall inform itself as to the
existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same
against damage. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)

work begins. The staking shall have all necessary information, including, but
not limited to, stationing, cut or fill data, offset distance and invert
elevations. The information shall be placed on the face of stakes in a legible
manner using weatherproof marking materials. When a water main design has a
profile with grades, the water department will require a grade line be set at
the designed grades prior to installation of any pipe. A laser may be used in
lieu of a grade line if approved by the water department. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-
2006)
7-4-10: EXCAVATION STANDARDS:
   A.   Preparation: The pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surface shall be
cut vertically along the lines forming the trench in such a manner as to not
damage the adjoining pavement or hard surfacing. An undercut bevel at the rate
of one inch (1") per foot of thickness will be provided at the proposed
junction between the old and new surfaces. The portion to be removed shall be
broken up in a manner that will not cause damage to the pavement outside the
limits of the trench. However, any pavement damaged by operations outside the
limits of the trench shall be replaced. All waste material resulting from the
excavation shall be removed immediately from the site of the work.
   B.   Cutting: All asphalt cuts shall be made with a diamond or carbide
tipped masonry or asphalt cutting saw or with a steel asphalt cutting wheel
attached to a grader or backhoe. No scarifier tooth cuts, backhoe or bucket
rips will be allowed.
   C.   Sheeting, Bracing, And Shoring Of Excavations: All excavations shall be
sheeted, braced, and shored as required to protect the workers and existing
utilities and improvements from sliding, sloughing, or settling of the trench
walls while the work is in progress. All such sheeting, bracing and shoring
shall comply with the requirements of the Utah state industrial commission. All
damage resulting from lack of adequate sheeting, bracing and shoring shall be
the responsibility of the contractor, and the contractor shall make all
necessary repairs or reconstruction resulting from such damage.
   D.   Restoration: All concrete or asphalt surfaces damaged or cut in
trenching operations shall be restored to an "as good or better condition" than
prior to excavation. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-11: CONTROL OF GROUND WATER:
All trenches shall be kept free from water during excavation, fine grading,
pipe laying, jointing, and embedment operations. Where the trench bottom is
mucky or otherwise unstable because of the presence of ground water, and in
cases where the static ground water elevation is above the bottom of any trench
or bell hole excavation, such ground water shall be lowered to the extent
necessary to keep the trench free from water and the trench bottom stable when
the work within the trench is in progress. Surface water shall be prevented
from entering the trenches. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-12: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DISCOVERIES:
   A.   Discovery: If suspected hazardous materials including chemicals,
petroleum products, etc., are encountered, construction operations shall be
immediately stopped in the vicinity of the discovery and the LaVerkin City
representative shall be verbally notified of the nature and exact location of
the findings. The contractor shall secure the site of the discovery and shall
provide written confirmation of the discovery to the LaVerkin City
representative within twenty four (24) hours. The written confirmation shall
include a statement regarding the responsibility of the LaVerkin City
representative to report the discovery to the local health district and the
Utah department of environmental response and remediation within twenty four
(24) hours as required by federal statute (40 CFR 280.50) as adopted by the
state of Utah.

The methods employed in performing the work shall be the responsibility of the
developer. The developer shall make such changes in the methods employed as are
necessary to install an acceptable finished product. These methods shall
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   A.   Construction Of Embankments: Unsuitable materials that occur in the
foundations for embankments shall be removed by clearing, stripping and/or
grubbing. Soils used as roadway embankment material shall be approved by a
geotechnical engineer licensed in the state of Utah. All materials in
embankments shall be placed, moistened, and compacted as provided in the
following subsections.
      1.   When the embankment exceeds the amount of excavation, sufficient
additional material shall be obtained from borrow pits provided by the
contractor. All material proposed to be imported shall be subject to the review
and approval of LaVerkin City prior to starting of hauling operations. The
materials used for embankment construction shall be free from sod, grass,
trash, rocks larger than three inches (3") in diameter and all other material
unsuitable for construction of embankments. Rocks larger than three inches (3")
may be proposed by the geotechnical engineer, to be revised by the city
engineer.
      2.   Grading of completed embankments and backfills shall bring the
surfaces to a smooth, uniform condition with final grades being within 0.1 foot
of the design grade. Cut and fill slopes shall be two (2) horizontal/one
vertical maximum. Construction of slopes steeper than two (2) horizontal/one
vertical or fills in excess of five feet (5') shall be approved by the LaVerkin
City engineer.
   B.   Compaction Of Earth Materials:
      1.   The fill material shall be deposited in horizontal layers having a
thickness of not more than six inches (6") and then compacted to the specified
density as herein specified. Moisture content during compaction operations
shall be within two percent (2%) optimum for granular soils and at two (2) to
five percent (5%) above optimum for fine grained soils. The moisture content
shall be uniform throughout the layers.
      2.   If the moisture content is greater than specified for compaction,
the compaction operations shall be delayed until the material has dried to the
specified moisture content or material is blended/replaced. When the material
has been conditioned as specified, the backfill or embankment shall be
compacted as directed below.
      3.   Under roadways, curb and gutter, sidewalks, and driveways, in
accordance with AASHTO standards, the embankment material shall be compacted to
a density equal to not less than ninety five percent (95%) for granular soils
and ninety percent (90%) for fine grain soils as classified by AASHTO M-145
soil classification system. Other fills and embankments not listed above shall
be compacted to ninety percent (90%) maximum dry density. Any variance shall be
approved by the LaVerkin City engineer.
      4.   Exposed natural soils within building areas, beneath walkways,
slabs, and pavement shall be scarified to a depth of six inches (6"), moisture
conditioned, and compacted to the specified density.
      5.   Foundations for structures shall not be placed partially on
undisturbed soil or compacted fill and partially on cemented deposits or rock.
      6.   Foundation soils shall not be allowed to become saturated during
construction.
   C.   Subgrade Preparation:
      1.   As a minimum, the original soils under roadways, curb and gutter,
sidewalks, and driveways shall be scarified to a depth of six inches (6") prior
to compaction operations. All scarified soils shall be compacted to the
equivalent of ninety five percent (95%) of maximum dry density for granular
soils or ninety percent (90%) of maximum dry density for fine grain soils as
classified by AASHTO M-145 soil classification system. Additional over
excavation and recompaction of original soils due to poor subgrade conditions
may be required by the geotechnical report. Subgrades shall be shaped and
graded to within a tolerance of 0.10 foot of design grade and drainage shall be
maintained at all times. Subgrades shall be stabilized and compacted as
directed by the LaVerkin City representative. Any springs or underground water
encountered in the construction of the streets shall be properly disposed of in
accordance with instructions of LaVerkin City.
      2.   When required to demonstrate the stability and compaction of the
subgrade, the contractor shall proof roll the subgrade prior to laying any base
gravel. The subgrade shall be proof rolled with at least one pass coverage with
a pneumatic tired roller of at least ten (10) ton capacity. All proof rolling
shall be accomplished in the presence of the LaVerkin City representative.
Ground contact pressure for all tires shall be eighty five (85) to ninety (90)
psi.
      3.   When the proof rolling shows an area to be unstable, it shall be
brought to satisfactory stability by additional compaction, reworking, or
removal of unsuitable material and replacement with acceptable material.
      4.   The subgrade preparation requirements listed above are the minimum
requirements. When the soils report requires, a certain amount of over
excavation of the native material may be required. In such cases, importing and
placement of select borrow material may be required, as directed by the
LaVerkin City representative. The material shall be placed and compacted in
accordance with the requirements of LaVerkin City.
   D.   Construction Of Nonstructural Fills: Nonstructural fills shall be
placed to the lines shown on the drawings and shall be any areas not
specifically designated for support of structures or utilities such as
landscape areas, and open space areas. Fill material shall have no specific
compaction requirements but shall consist of material that can be compacted to
prevent settlement such as rocks, old building blocks, crushed stone, broken up
concrete, gravel, cobbles, etc., with a maximum diameter of six inches (6").
Fill material shall not include broken up asphalt, toxic or hazardous materials
or waste sludge, organic or deleterious materials such as muck, ash, sod,
grass, trash, tree stumps, lumber, dead animals, etc. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)

the requirements of section
7-4-17 of this chapter, shall be placed carefully in eight inch (8")
noncompacted horizontal layers and tamped to a depth of twelve inches (12")
over the top of the pipe. During compaction of the initial backfill, special
care shall be taken not to move the pipe, either vertically or horizontally.
   B.   Protection Of Pipes: All backfill operations shall be performed in such
a manner to avoid any damage to the pipe, valves, laterals, etc.
   C.   Pipe Displacement: In the event such damage or displacement occurs,
such damaged or displaced pipe shall be removed and replaced with undamaged
pipe on proper grade and alignment. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-20: MECHANICAL COMPACTION OF BACKFILL:
   A.   Compaction: The backfill shall be thoroughly compacted by consolidation
or mechanical compaction. Structural and trench backfill shall be deposited in
horizontal layers and compacted by the following method in such manner that the
compacted material will be homogeneous and free from lenses, pockets, streaks,
and other imperfections:
      1.   The materials shall be deposited in horizontal layers across the
length or width of the excavation of not more than six inches' (6") compacted
thickness.
      2.   The excavation and placing operations shall be such that the
materials when compacted will be blended sufficiently to secure the best
practicable degree of compaction, impermeability, and stability.
      3.   Prior to and during compaction operations, all backfill material
shall have the optimum practicable moisture content within two percent (2%) and
shall be uniform throughout each layer.
   B.   Moisturizing Materials: Moisturizing of the materials shall be
performed at the site of excavation. If the moisture content is not optimum
within two percent (2%) for compaction, the compaction operations shall be
delayed until such time that the material has been brought to the optimum
moisture content. When the material has been properly conditioned, it shall be
compacted by using appropriate mechanical compaction equipment as indicated
below:
      1.   Vibrating rollers shall consist of a self-propelled roller with a
vibrating steel drum of at least one ton capacity. The roller shall have an
effective rolling width of at least twenty four inches (24") and shall deliver
a compaction force of at least seven hundred (700) pounds per square inch when
vibrating.
      2.   Pneumatic rollers shall consist of a self-propelled roller with
pneumatic tires arranged in a manner to provide a satisfactory compacting unit.
The roller shall have an effective rolling width of at least thirty inches
(30") and shall give a compaction force of at least five hundred (500) pounds
per inch of width of tread when fully loaded. The tires shall be uniformly
inflated.
      3.   Vibrating plates shall consist of a pneumatic vibrating plate
attached to the boom of a backhoe and capable of compacting an area of at least
three (3) square feet. The plate and backhoe combination shall together be
capable of exerting a compactive force of at least one thousand (1,000) pounds
per square inch.
      4.   Hand compactors shall be used when hand compacted methods are
specified or required because the location of the area to be compacted does not
permit the use of self-propelled mechanical compactors. Vibrating plates, "pogo
stick" tampers, or other approved hand compacting equipment shall be used.
(Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-21: FINAL BACKFILL PROCEDURE:
The backfill above a point twelve inches (12") above the top of the pipe shall
be backfilled in horizontal layers twelve inches (12") thick or less with
materials containing no brush, perishable or objectionable material, or rocks,
stones or boulders larger than six inches (6") in the greatest dimension. The
material shall be mechanically compacted with appropriate vibrating compaction
equipment. Wherever, in the opinion of the LaVerkin City representative surface
settlement is not critical, consolidation or compaction may be omitted and the
backfill shall be neatly rounded over the trench to a sufficient height to
allow for settlement to grade after consolidation. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-22: EXCAVATION AND RESTORATION OF SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS:

sidewalk, curb, gutter, driveway and other surfaces, within five (5) days from
the date of completion of the backfill, except for periods:
      1.   When permanent paving material is not available;
      2.   When weather conditions prevent permanent replacement;
      3.   When an extension of time is granted by the public works director.
   E.   Temporary Repair: If temporary repair has been made on the paved street
with gravel and a permanent repair cannot be made within the time specified
above due to any of the above mentioned conditions, then the excavator shall be
required to replace the gravel with cold mulch as soon as possible.
   F.   Temporary Grade Surface: Where excavations are made in paved areas, the
surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel surface. The gravel shall be
placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches (6") below the bottom of
the bituminous or concrete surface. Normally, this will require nine inches
(9") of gravel for bituminous surfaces, twelve inches (12") of gravel for
concrete and concrete base for asphalt wearing surfaces. The gravel shall be
placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled. The temporary gravel surface
shall be maintained by blading, sprinkling, rolling, adding gravel, to maintain
a safe, uniform surface satisfactory to the public works director until the
final surface is laid. Excess material shall be removed from the premises
immediately. Material for use on temporary gravel surfaces shall be obtained
from sound, tough, durable gravel or rock meeting the following requirements
for gradings:
      1.   Passing 1 inch sieve: 100 percent.

primed with type MC-1 bituminous material. The type, grade, and mixture of the
asphalt to be used for street surface replacement shall be approved by the
public works director. Bituminous surfaces shall be restored by standard paving
practices to a thickness equal to the original pavement but not less than three
inches (3"). The finished repaired surface shall not deviate more than one-half
inch (1/2") vertically from the existing road surface. Any deviations greater
than specified shall be immediately removed and replaced to the proper
standards. Where trenches are excavated through bituminous surfaced roads,
driveways or parking areas, the surface shall be restored within five (5) days
as follows:
      1.   Mud or other soft or spongy material shall be removed from the
trench and the space filled with granular backfill to within twelve inches
(12") of finished grade. The pit run gravel shall be rolled and tamped to a
minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of maximum dry density in layers not
exceeding six inches (6") in compacted thickness. Base gravel shall then be
placed to a depth equal to the original gravel base, but not less than six
inches (6") thick and compacted to a minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of
maximum dry density.
      2.   Prior to permanent resurfacing, the contractor shall saw cut the
existing paving to vertical, clean, straight lines as nearly parallel to the
centerline of the trench as practical. The existing bituminous paving shall be
cut back beyond the limits of any excavation so that the edges of the new
paving will rest on at least six inches (6") of undisturbed soil.
      3.   Pavement restoration shall include tacking of pavement edges with
type SS-1H bituminous material, and placing and rolling plant mix asphalt to
the level of the adjacent pavement surfaces.
      4.   All backfilled trenches in roadways shall be patched with hot mix
asphalt within five (5) days of initial excavation unless otherwise directed by
the LaVerkin City representative. The backfill section shall be according to

   C.   No Cut Policy: When a street has been newly improved, there will be a
"no cut" policy in force that will not allow the new asphalt to be cut to
install utilities or for other reasons for a period of two (2) years. After the
two (2) year period all cuts must meet the following standards:
      1.   Flowable backfill (1 bag mix) in trench (at city's discretion);
      2.   Ten foot (10') minimum patch width (2 foot minimum each side of
trench);
      3.   Saw cut edges of patch;
      4.   Patch must be machine laid hot mix (cold mix may be used temporarily
if hot mix cannot be obtained then removed and replaced with hot mix when it is
available);
      5.   Patch shall be three inches' (3") asphalt over nine inches' (9")
granular base meeting city standards;
      6.   Seal the saw cut edges with a rubberized crack fill material.
   D.   No Cut Exceptions: Exceptions to the "no cut" policy during the first
two (2) years may be made on a case by case basis. The following standards will
apply where exceptions are granted:
      1.   Flowable backfill (1 bag mix) in trench (at city's discretion);
      2.   Twelve foot (12') minimum patch width (3 foot minimum each side of
trench);
      3.   Saw cut edges of patch;
      4.   Patch must be machine laid hot mix, cold mix may be used temporarily
if hot mix cannot be obtained then removed and replaced with hot mix when it is
available, or at the discretion of the LaVerkin City street department;
      5.   Patch shall be three inches' (3") asphalt over twelve inches' (12")
granular base meeting city standards;
      6.   Fill the saw cut edges with a rubberized crack fill material.
   E.   Flowable Backfill Installation Exceptions: In lieu of backfilling all
trenches cut into new city streets with flowable backfill as set forth above,
contractors, utility companies or any other entity working on new city streets
may backfill any trench according to the specifications and standards set forth
in section
7-4-14 of this chapter provided that such contractor, utility company or other
entity working on new city streets provides the following:
      1.   A written warranty in a form approved by the city providing that if
such trench compaction subsides, sinks or otherwise fails for any reason, or
the pavement over the compacted trench cracks, during the life of said trench,
that the contractor, utility company or other entity will repair and recompact
said trench. Such repair shall be completed at no cost to the city according to
the standards set forth in section
7-4-14 of this chapter. Repairs shall be completed within thirty (30) days
after receiving written notice that such trench has failed. However, in an
"emergency", which is defined as the failure of any trench due to a natural or
artificial condition and which poses an eminent risk to persons or property,
such contractor, utility company or entity whose trench failed will undertake
all reasonable steps to protect persons or property from further damage, within
twenty four (24) hours after receiving notice from the city. Such steps shall
include, but are not limited to, erecting barricades, warning lights, lanterns,
flares, or other devices to alert the public to the potential hazard.
Thereafter, such contractor, utility company or entity shall commence repairs
to the affected trench as soon as practicable according to the standards set
forth herein; and
      2.   Any contractor, utility company, or entity incapable of providing
evidence of a net worth in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) must
in lieu thereof, also post a cash bond for the estimated and reasonable cost to
repair said trench as established by the city engineer. The city will retain
said cash bond for two (2) years following completion of the trench work. If,
upon inspection by the city engineer or inspector after the expiration of two
(2) years, it is discovered that the trench is still intact and has not
subsided, sunk or otherwise failed for any reason, the city will release such
bond.
   F.   Conflicts: Where the provisions of this section conflict with the
provisions of other sections, the provisions of this section shall take
precedence.
   G.   Concrete Surfaces: The subbase for concrete surfaces shall be sprinkled
just before placing the concrete. Joints and surfaces shall be made to match
the original surfaces. The thickness of concrete shall be equal to the adjacent
concrete but in no case less than six inches (6") thick. The mixing, cement,
water content, proportion, placement, and curing of the concrete will be
approved by the public works director. In no case shall the concrete have less
compressive strength than three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch at the
end of twenty eight (28) days.
   H.   Concrete Base, Bituminous Wearing Surfaces: This type of surfacing
shall be constructed as outlined in chapter 3 of this title.
   I.   Gravel Surfaces: Trenches excavated through gravel surfaced area, such
as gravel roads and shoulders and unpaved driveways, shall have the gravel
restored and maintained as described in this chapter, except that the gravel
shall be a minimum of one inch (1") more than the thickness of the existing
gravel. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
7-4-25: BLASTING; USE OF EXPLOSIVES:
   A.   Blasting Permit Required: Blasting will not be allowed except by
written permit from the LaVerkin fire authority. If the permit is granted, the
contractor shall comply with all laws, ordinances, and applicable safety code
requirements and regulations relative to the handling, storage, and use of
explosives and protection of life and property. Any conflict with these
regulations and permit issued by fire authority, the fire authority
requirements shall take precedence. The blasting permit shall be site specific
and expire thirty (30) days from issuance, unless otherwise extended by the
issuing agency.
   B.   Additions: All requirements contained in this section shall be
followed: (Ord. 2006-24, 7-5-2006)
      1.   The use of explosives or blasting agents is controlled by the
applicable building related code(s); (Ord. 2007-24, 8-15-2007)
      2.   The contractor shall obtain a special permit from the LaVerkin City
fire department for the use of explosives;
      3.   A copy of this permit shall be delivered to the LaVerkin City
representative prior to the use of explosives;
      4.   The approval by the LaVerkin City representative for the use of
explosives shall not relieve the contractor from his responsibilities for
proper use and handling of the explosives or for any damages resulting from
their use.
   C.   Handling: Explosives shall be transported, stored, handled, and used in
accordance with the provisions and requirements of all applicable laws,
ordinances and regulations.
   D.   Command, Control And Permits: When any blasting is to occur within the
limits of LaVerkin City, a permit for such activity shall be applied for at
least three (3) working days prior to the desired blasting day. A detailed
blast plan shall be submitted for review at the time of application for a
permit. The blast plan shall contain the following information:
      1.   Number of holes per blast;
      2.   Blast pattern;
      3.   Depth of holes;
      4.   Maximum holes per delay;
      5.   Numbers of the delays used;
      6.   Type of explosives used;
      7.   Total pounds of explosives;
      8.   Maximum pounds per delay;
      9.   Method of detonation;
      10.   Proximity to nearest structure;
      11.   Expected duration of blasting activity;
      12.   Name of independent monitoring company;
      13.   Whether or not preblast survey is required and the name of the
company doing such a survey;
      14.   Plan outline for notification of fire marshal, fire chief or
governing agency one hour prior to detonation of each blast and approximate
time of each blast.
   E.   Blasting Criteria: In accordance with United States bureau of mines
(USBM) report 8705, two inches (2") per second (IPS) when the frequencies are
greater than fifty (50) hertz (Hz) in any of the three (3) spatial components
in which the data is being collected:
      1.   The blaster shall submit with his permit application the projected
equative scale distance to be represented by each blast in relationship to the
nearest structure. This scale distance shall not be less than fifty (50). If
the scale distance results in a number less than fifty (50) the blaster will be
required to modify the blasting plan in order to produce a safe blast within
the above parameters.
      2.   Blasting activity that is to occur within one thousand feet (1,000')
of any school, public or private, university, daycare center, church, library,
medical facility, or any public building shall be conducted during off hours
where possible and shall require seismic monitoring of each blast to ensure the
integrity of the building as well as the safety of the occupants of said
buildings. Since there is a wide variety in the type density, specific gravity,
velocity, and general characteristics within the graphical area of southern
Utah, there are varied methods that can be employed to attain the desired
results. These methods, if used and however varied, shall adhere to the above
limit criteria.
      3.   Any blasting that is intended within five hundred feet (500') of any
structure, building, tunnel, underground utilities, gas lines, overhead
transmission lines, pump station, piping, radio tower, or any other structure
of any kind, requires that the blast be monitored with a seismograph capable of
measuring peak particle velocities in three (3) spatial components of
horizontal, vertical and transverse and be capable of printing this data into a
permanent digital record as well as wave form and air blast over pressure in
terms of millibar, psi or decibel (dB) recording of each event. Any structure
such as residential homes, commercial buildings, public buildings, storage
facilities, or any other permanent structure that is within five hundred feet
(500') of blasting activity shall be required to have a preblast survey
performed at the expense of the contractor and/or the blaster by an independent
company whose primary nature of business is to conduct and perform these types
of services. The said company shall furnish to the authorizing agency a copy of
the preblast survey report prior to issuance of the blasting permit. A
certificate of insurance issued by an underwriter legally doing business within
the state of Utah showing contractor and/or blaster to be properly insured for
the express purpose of blasting and showing the issuing agency as additional
insured, shall be submitted with the application of the blasting permit. The
amount of insurance shown on the certificate of insurance shall be in the
amount required by the LaVerkin City fire authority or the LaVerkin City
representative.
      4.   Furnish and erect special signs to warn the public of his blasting
operations. They shall be located and maintained to be evident to the public
during all critical periods of blasting operations.
      5.   Notify each public utility company, having structures or facilities
adjacent to the work, of his intention to use explosives. Such notice shall be
given sufficiently in advance to enable the companies to advise the contractor
of any precautions that should be taken to protect their structures from
damage.
      6.   Make a survey of adjacent properties, before commencing blasting
operations, locating on drawings and by photographs all existing cracks and
damages to structures. A copy shall be filed with the LaVerkin City
representative, including a report of any property owners who refused to permit
entry and inspection.
      7.   Blasting shall be accomplished in such a manner that nearby
buildings, structures, railways, highways, etc., will be safe from rocks and
other projectiles. Adequate blasting mats or other means of protection shall be
employed when blasting in congested area or close proximity to any of the above
improvements. Steel mats shall not be allowed within two thousand feet (2,000')
of power lines.
      8.   At the time of firing, the contractor shall station certified
flaggers along the road at sufficient distance from the blasting operation to
flag down any vehicles.
      9.   LaVerkin City reserves the right to order the discontinuance of
blasting operations at any time.
   F.   Electric Detonation Method: Electric detonators, if employed, shall be
manufactured by a company currently in business. Such detonators shall be used
in series and be of twenty five (25), fifty (50), or one hundred (100)
milliseconds' delay. Millisecond series delay devices for multi-linking larger
events may also be used provided they have been included in the approved blast
plan.
   G.   Nonelectric Detonation: Several methods of detonation utilizing other
than electric detonators or blasting caps are used by the blasting industry.
Since, under certain conditions, use of nonelectric detonators instead of
standard electric caps can be advantageous, they may be used provided they
possess delay capability and have been described in the approved blast plan.
   H.   Explosives And Accelerants:
      1.   Limits: Based on utilization of forty/sixty percent (40/60%) nitro
based explosives and the utilization of ammonium nitrate based accelerants the
following limits shall be adhered to:
         a.   One thousand feet (1,000') or greater from any structure, a
charge no greater than twenty two and one-half (221/2) pounds of accelerants
and/or explosives per delay.
         b.   Between five hundred (500) and one thousand feet (1,000') from
any structure, a charge no greater than fifteen (15) pounds of accelerants and/
or explosives per delay.
         c.   Between two hundred fifty (250) and five hundred feet (500') from
any structure, a charge no greater than eight and one-half (81/2) pounds of
accelerants and/or explosives per delay.
         d.   Between one hundred (100) and two hundred fifty feet (250') from
any structure, a charge no greater than four and three- tenths (43/10) pounds
of accelerants and/or explosives per delay.
         e.   Under one hundred feet (100') from any structure, a charge no
greater than two and one-half (21/2) pounds of accelerants and/or explosives
per delay. No ammonium nitrate based accelerants may be used within this area.
      2.   Notes: Since the purpose of blasting is the breakup and removal of
rock, utilizing shock waves generated by explosives, it should be understood
that these same shock waves travel through the formation resulting in potential
damage to any structure that may be in contact with the same formation. Most of
the formations in the geographical area of southern Utah fall into three (3)
general categories. Each, generally speaking, has its own specific gravity and
resonant velocities with some minor variations. Most of these resonant
velocities occur at greater than twelve thousand (12,000) IPS and at
frequencies of greater than fifty (50) hertz. It is therefore necessary to meet
or exceed these resonant velocities and frequencies in order to accomplish the
desired breakage of the rock.
      3.   Ammonium Nitrate Accelerants: Although ammonium nitrate based
accelerants provide an inexpensive enhancement to the nitro based explosives,
their velocities are generally well below twelve thousand (12,000) IPS and
produce frequencies under fifty (50) hertz. Therefore, the use of ammonium
nitrate based accelerants within close proximity to existing structures shall
not be permitted. As per USBM report 8707, the greatest potential for
structural damage to occur is when the peak particle velocity (PPV) exceeds two
(2) IPS with frequencies of less than fifty (50) hertz. In addition, the use of
these accelerants has a tendency to increase the air blast over pressures and
lower frequencies within close proximity to the blast.
   I.   Storage And Transportation: Explosives shall be stored in a magazine
with separate storage compartments and/or a separate magazine for the storage
and transportation of detonators as per NFSC specifications.
   J.   Stemming: Stemming shall consist of three-eighths inch (3/8") gravel
with a minimum vertical fill dimension of no less than three feet (3') covering
each charge. Cuttings, sand, gravel, or any other on site material will not be
accepted when blasting is to occur within five hundred feet (500') of any
structure.
   K.   Flyrock:
      1.   Within five hundred feet (500') of any structure the use of
certified blasting mats to cover each charge shall be required. The number of
holes per blast shall be limited to the blaster's ability to adequately cover
and protect each charge hole. However, no more than fifty two (52) holes shall
be loaded and detonated at any one time when within five hundred feet (500') of
any structure.
      2.   When within five hundred (500) to one thousand feet (1,000') of any
structure, the blaster shall continue to utilize blasting mats. However,
utilization of sand, or other suitable on site material having an aggregate
containing material four inches (4") in diameter or less can be used as cover
for a height of three feet (3') or greater over the top of the existing charge
holes. No more than one hundred eighteen (118) holes shall be loaded and
detonated at any one time with the five hundred (500) to one thousand foot
(1,000') range of any structure.
   L.   Logs: Each blaster shall keep a detailed record of each blasting event.
Such record shall contain the following information:
      1.   Depths of holes;
      2.   The hole pattern or spacing, confined or free face;
      3.   The total number of holes detonated per event;
      4.   Number and series of delays used;
      5.   Method of detonation;
      6.   Maximum pounds of explosives;
      7.   Maximum pounds per delay;
      8.   Maximum pounds of accelerants;
      9.   Total pounds for the blast;
      10.   Vertical spacing of decks;
      11.   Manufacturer and type of blasting agent, accelerants if applicable,
and detonation device or devices;
      12.   The material and depth of stemming;
      13.   Distance and direction of the blast from nearest structure and
location within the construction site of blast, i.e., station marker, lot
corner, survey marker and so on;
      14.   The time of the blast;
      15.   Name of the blaster and assistants, including address and phone
number;
      16.   Name of seismograph company, if applicable, and resultant
seismograph reading with regard to peak particle velocity (PPV), decibel (dB)
and frequency (FWHz).
   M.   Surrender Logs Upon Request: The blaster shall at the request of any
authorizing agency, surrender logs, or a copy thereof, for review by said
agency within twenty four (24) hours of receiving such request. Failure to keep
current and/or surrender the logs to said authority will result in the
immediate cancellation of any permits issued within the scope of the
jurisdiction of these authorizing agencies. No further permits will then be
issued within thirty (30) days of submission of said records. (Ord. 2006-24, 7-

form of cash deposited with the city and held in an interest bearing account,
or a letter of credit from an approved institution or such other cash security
bond as the subdivider may obtain that is approved by the city.
         b.   Amount Of Bond: The bond shall be equal to the cost of the
improvements, plus twenty five percent (25%). The subdivider shall furnish an
estimate of the cost of constructing the required improvements. Said estimate
shall be prepared by an engineer registered to practice in the state. However,
no estimate may be used as the basis for the amount of the bond until it has
been approved by the city engineer.
         c.   Duration: The duration of the bond shall be for one year from the
date of approval of project or such lesser time as is required to complete the
said improvements.
         d.   Final Inspection And Partial Release Of Bond Or Default: The
applicant shall be responsible for the quality of all materials and workmanship
of all improvements. At the completion of the work, or no later than one year
from the date of approval of the application, the city engineer and public
works director shall make a preliminary inspection of the improvements and
shall submit a report to the city manager, setting forth the conditions of such
facilities. If the improvements are completed, all liens are paid, and
conditions thereof are found to be satisfactory, the city manager shall release
all but twenty five percent (25%) of the deposit or bond or security. If the
improvements are not yet completed, or are completed but conditions or
materials or workmanship show unusual depreciation or do not comply with the
standards of the city in effect at the time of final plat approval, or if any
outstanding liens are not paid, the procedures in subsection B4f of this
section shall be followed.
         e.   Final City Acceptance: The applicant shall be responsible for the
irrigation system improvements for a period of one year after said improvements
are completed. In accordance therewith, the twenty five percent (25%) cash
bond, or equivalent as approved, which is retained after completion of the
improvements, shall be preserved in escrow by the city for a period of one year
to assure that if latent defects or other problems with the improvements are
found, whereby the improvements fail to meet city standards, such defects and/
or problems are repaired and made to comply with city standards. Ninety (90)
days prior to the one year anniversary of the date the twenty five percent
(25%) deposit or bond or security is created, the city engineer and public
works director shall again inspect the improvements and shall make a checklist
of any needed repairs and a report of the condition of the facilities, which
shall then be submitted to the city manager. If the improvements are
satisfactory at the time of this inspection, the city manager shall direct that
the twenty five percent (25%) deposit, bond, or security retained in escrow
shall be released to the applicant. If defects or problems are found at this
inspection, the procedures in subsection B4f of this section shall be followed.
Once the needed repairs and improvements have been made and are acceptable to
the city, and after the city has received all required drawings of record
showing any changes to the improvements, the city shall release any remaining
deposit or bond or security amount and shall make final acceptance of and
assume responsibility for the irrigation improvements.
         f.   Default Procedures: If an inspection reveals that the
improvements are deficient, the city shall notify the applicant that he is in
default, and set a reasonable time period, not to exceed ninety (90) days, to
correct the problem. At the end of the specified time, the improvements shall
be reinspected, and if the improvements still fail to meet the required
standards and the applicant has not submitted to the city and obtained approval
of a plan with a deadline to correct the problem, the city council shall notify
the applicant of the date a public hearing shall be held on the issue, at which
the applicant shall be entitled to demonstrate why all or part of his bond
should not be forfeited to be used to remedy the problem. The city council
shall decide the matter and issue written findings on the same no later than
thirty (30) days after the public hearing. If the city council's decision after
the hearing is that the subdivider is still in default and no agreement with a
deadline between the city and the applicant has been made to fix the problem,
the city council may declare his cash deposit or bond or equivalent forfeited,
and the city may use the same to repair or install the required improvements.
In such case, if the bond is found to be insufficient to cover the reasonable
cost of completing or repairing the improvements, the city may enforce the
terms of the irrigation improvement cost overrun agreement described in
subsection B4h of this section. Once the needed repairs and improvements have
been made and are acceptable to the city, and after the city has received all
required drawings of record, the city shall release any remaining bond or
equivalent, less twenty five percent (25%) in the case of a bond for original
improvements, which twenty five percent (25%) bond shall be held pursuant to
subsection B4e of this section.
         g.   Agreement Deadline: In the event the applicant and the city enter
into an agreement with a deadline for the applicant to remedy a problem with
the irrigation improvements, if upon inspection by the city it is found that
the applicant has substantially failed to live up to the terms of said
agreement and/or failed to meet the agreed deadline, the city council may

8-6-1: POLICY:
It shall be the policy of the city to implement the procedures and restrictions
outlined herein under four (4) stages of culinary water resource shortage that
may occur in the LaVerkin City area. (Ord. 2005-23, 5-17-2005)
8-6-2: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The culinary water shortage and drought management plan is intended to
establish measures for essential conservation of water resources and to provide
for the equitable distribution of limited water supplies in order to balance
demand and limited available supplies and to assure that sufficient water is
available to preserve public health and safety within the city of LaVerkin.
(Ord. 2005-23, 5-17-2005)
8-6-3: PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
   A.   The city shall encourage wise use of water and conservation of all
water resources on an ongoing basis.
   B.   In the event of an unforeseeable event such as an extended drought,
earthquake, reservoir or well failure or other major disruption of the water
supply, the city will implement the attached four (4) stage culinary water
conservation management plan (the "plan"). The implementation of the plan will
become effective upon the recommendation of the water board and the approval of
the city council. The water board shall meet on a regular basis to discuss
water levels and availability status. The water board will also work to ensure
that all city departments are doing their part to comply, enforce and encourage
the application of the water management plan herein.
   C.   Water conservation stages shall be determined by the amount of water
available or the potential for water interruption. The public works department
shall monitor the supply and customer demand during peak hours for culinary
water on a regular basis. "Peak hours" are defined as the hours between ten
o'clock (10:00) A.M. and six o'clock (6:00) P.M. The frequency of monitoring
will increase with the implementation of each subsequent water conservation
stage as defined in the plan. When the public works director and city manager
agree that the conditions meet the guidelines for initiating any stage of the
plan, as set forth in this chapter, they shall: 1) notify the mayor, council
and water board, and 2) recommend that the mayor and/or city council declare
the water conservation plan and applicable stage in effect.
   D.   Except as otherwise stated in this chapter, implementation of the plan
shall become effective immediately upon adoption of this chapter by the city
council. Except as otherwise declared by the city council, any provisions
requiring a reduction in the use of water shall become effective commencing on
or after the date of such notification. (Ord. 2005-23, 5-17-2005)
8-6-4: WATER CONSERVATION PLAN:
The water conservation guidelines included below shall be used to decide which
stage of the water conservation plan shall be implemented.
   A.   Stage 1: Voluntary Restrictions On Nonessential Water Use:
      1.   Reduction Goal: Ten percent (10%) of peak use.
      2.   Measurement Schedule: The public works director will measure the
water usage levels monthly, monitoring LaVerkin City usage levels as a
percentage of the total (yield) of the springs.
      3.   Procedure: Voluntary restrictions shall be in effect annually from
May 1 to September 1. The following conservation methods include a list of
inside and outside conservation efforts and suggestions. The public shall be
given notice of the plan going into effect within twenty four (24) hours of
such declaration. This notice and list of conservation methods shall be
immediately distributed to the public as educational materials in the local
newspaper, flyers and mailers, advising the community that the water
conservation plan is in effect.
         a.   Inside:
            (1)   Fix dripping and leaking faucets and toilets. A leak in the
toilet can waste more than one hundred (100) gallons of water a day.
            (2)   Do not let the water run while shaving. Filling the sink
basin when shaving uses one gallon of water, letting the water run uses five
(5) to ten (10) gallons.
            (3)   Do not flush the toilet unnecessarily. Consider installing
water saving toilets. Water saving toilets use 1.6 gallons of water, standard
toilets use five (5) to seven (7) gallons of water each flush.
            (4)   Take shorter showers or fill bathtub only part way. Long
showers waste five (5) to ten (10) gallons of water every minute.
            (5)   Consider installing low flow showerheads.
            (6)   Do not run the water while brushing teeth. Turning the water
off while brushing your teeth can save 1.5 to 3.5 gallons of water.
            (7)   Do not run the tap to make water hot or cold. Keep a bottle
of drinking water in the refrigerator so you do not have to run the tap to get
a cool drink of water.
            (8)   Wash only full loads of dishes and laundry. A dishwasher uses
approximately twenty five (25) gallons of water; a washing machine uses thirty
(30) to thirty five (35) gallons of water per cycle.
            (9)   Consider replacing any appliance that utilizes water with a
low flow type appliance if such appliance is not already low flow.
            (10)   Reduce or eliminate the use of the garbage disposal.
            (11)   Wash fruits and vegetables in a basin instead of under
running water.
            (12)   Adjust temperatures in buildings with water cooled air
conditioners to require less water.
         b.   Outside:
            (1)   Reduce the use of culinary water for irrigation.
            (2)   Raise your lawn mower cutting height. Longer grass needs less
water.
            (3)   Delay planting any new grass, sod or other new landscaping.
            (4)   Do not fill swimming pools. If possible, cover the swimming
pool. An uncovered pool will lose nine hundred (900) to three thousand (3,000)
gallons of water a month to evaporation. A covered pool loses three hundred
(300) to one thousand (1,000) gallons a month.
            (5)   Use a hose with a shutoff nozzle if washing cars at home or
wash at a facility that recycles water. Washing the car with the hose running
uses one hundred (100) to two hundred (200) gallons of water.
            (6)   Sweep sidewalks and steps rather than hosing.
            (7)   Aerate turf areas.
            (8)   Know your plants' water requirements and apply only the
amount required for good plant health.
            (9)   Monitor ET data. Know how much moisture is lost to
evapotranspiration (ET) as this is what needs to be replaced back into the soil
for good plant health.
            (10)   Monitor soil moisture to determine if watering is needed.
            (11)   Water between the hours of eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. and

   B.   Stage 2: Mandatory Restrictions On Nonessential Water Use:
      1.   Reduction Goal: Fifteen (15) to twenty percent (20%) of peak use.
      2.   Measurement Schedule: The public works director will measure the
water usage levels weekly, monitoring LaVerkin City usage levels as a
percentage of the total (yield) of the springs. If municipal water usage
reaches ninety percent (90%) of the available water resources out of the upper
and lower Toquerville Springs ("the springs"), stage 2 water conservation is
determined. Note: "Available water resources" means the percentage of city
ownership of the total available yield from the springs up to a maximum of the
city's current water rights.
      3.   Procedure: When the public works director and city manager determine
that water utilization and availability has triggered stage 2 of the water
conservation plan, they shall notify the mayor, city council and water board.
The public shall also be given notice that stage 2 is going into effect.
The city manager and/or the mayor and city council shall then implement the
following mandatory water conservation measures in addition to voluntary
conservation:
         a.   Large irrigators using culinary water, including, but not limited
to, city parks and schools shall reduce irrigation by twenty five percent (25%)
of baseline year use. (The year 2000 is the recommended baseline year.)
         b.   Those using culinary water for irrigation will be allowed to
irrigate between the hours of eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. and eight o'clock (8:
00) A.M.
         c.   Use of water for washing streets, driveways, or other paved areas
is prohibited except to alleviate immediate fire or sanitation hazards.
         d.   Noncommercial car washing requires using a hose with an automatic
shutoff nozzle.
         e.   Filling of private swimming pools or hot tubs is prohibited.
         f.   Use of culinary water for ornamental fountains, waterfalls, or
reflection pools is prohibited.
         g.   Delay planting any new grass or sod or other new landscaping.

and residential uses.
   C.   Stage 3: Mandatory Restrictions On All Culinary Water Use:
      1.   Reduction Goal: Twenty five (25) to thirty percent (30%) of peak
use.
      2.   Measurement Schedule: The public works director will measure the
water usage levels daily, monitoring LaVerkin City usage levels as a percentage
of the total (yield) of the springs. If municipal water usage reaches ninety
five percent (95%) of available water resources out of the springs, stage 3
water conservation is determined.
      3.   Procedure: When the public works director and city manager determine
that water utilization and availability has triggered stage 3 of the water
conservation plan, they shall notify the mayor, city council and water board.
The public shall also be given notice that stage 3 is going into effect.
The city manager and/or the mayor and city council shall then implement the
mandatory water conservation measures required in stage 2 as well as the
following additional mandatory conservation measures in addition to voluntary
conservation:
         a.   The use of fire hydrants for purposes other than fire protection
will be prohibited.
         b.   If available, irrigation water may be used for construction
purposes.
         c.   Water use for noncommercial washing of automobiles and trucks
shall not be permitted.
         d.   Users will be allowed seventy percent (70%) of use levels of the
baseline year use. All users will reduce demand by thirty percent (30%).
         e.   Culinary water will not be used to irrigate city parks or
schools.
         f.   Spray irrigation and hand watering may occur for a total of
fifteen (15) minutes per landscaped area.
         g.   Culinary drip irrigation systems, bubbler, or soaker hoses may be
operated for maximum of two (2) hours.
      4.   Exemptions:
         a.   If compliance with the nonessential use of water restrictions
would result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the water user may
apply for an exemption or variance. For purposes of this section,
"extraordinary hardship" means a permanent damage to property or other personal
or economic loss, which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne
by other water users subject to the nonessential use of water restrictions.
         b.   A person or business entity believing he suffers an extraordinary
hardship and desiring to be wholly or partially exempt from the restrictions on
the nonessential use of water shall submit a written request with full
documentation supporting the need for the requested relief to the city. The
application shall contain information specifying:
            (1)   The nature of the hardship claimed and reasons for the
requested exemption or variance.
            (2)   The efforts taken by the applicant to conserve water and
extent to which the applicant, without extraordinary hardship, may reduce water
use.
         c.   The city shall advise the applicant of its decision regarding the
application within ten (10) days. An exemption or variance will be granted only
to the extent necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship.
   D.   Stage 4: Water Rationing Plan For All Available Culinary Water
Resources:
      1.   Reduction Goal: Forty (40) to sixty percent (60%) of peak use.
      2.   Measurement Schedule: The public works director will measure the
water usage levels at least one or more times daily as deemed necessary,
monitoring LaVerkin City usage levels as a percentage of the total (yield) of
the springs. If municipal water reaches ninety eight percent (98%) of available
water resources out of the springs, stage 4 water conservation is determined.
      3.   Procedure: When the public works director and city manager determine
that water utilization and availability has triggered stage 4 of the water
conservation plan, they shall notify the mayor, city council and water board.
Additional communication will also include press releases to the local
television, radio and newspaper services.
The city manager and/or the mayor and city council shall then implement the
following mandatory water conservation measures, in addition to voluntary
conservation:
         a.   General: It is imperative that water customers within the city of
LaVerkin area achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use in
order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that
sufficient water is available to preserve the public health, sanitation, and
provide fire protection service.
The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an immediate
forty percent (40%) reduction in water use. Should drought conditions continue,
further reductions in usage might be required. If it is necessary to implement
further reductions, this plan will be modified to meet the crisis.
The plan provides for equitable reductions in water use on the part of each
water customer. The success of this plan depends on the cooperation of all
water customers. During this stage, the approval of any new building permits
will be prohibited until the conservation restrictions are lifted.
         b.   Nonessential Use: It is the primary responsibility of each water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible. The following culinary water uses are declared nonessential and shall
be prohibited within the city of LaVerkin, in addition to the restrictions
specified in stages 2 and 3:
            (1)   Watering lawns with culinary water.
            (2)   Culinary watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas,
trees, shrubs and other outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket, pail or
handheld hose, equipped with an automatic shutoff nozzle between the hours of
eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. and eight o'clock (8:00) A.M.
            (3)   Use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by
municipalities or any public or private individual or entity, except as deemed
necessary and specifically approved by the city in the interest of public
health and/or safety.
            (4)   Use of fire hydrants for construction purposes.
            (5)   Use of fire hydrants by the fire department for testing fire
apparatus and for fire department drills, except as deemed necessary and
specifically approved by the city in the interest of public safety.
         c.   Water Use Restrictions For All Culinary Water Customers:
Customers include residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, public,
and all other users, with the exception of healthcare facilities.
         d.   Water Use Restrictions For Healthcare Facilities: Healthcare
facilities shall comply with all restrictions imposed on water customers as may
be applicable to each individual institution to the extent compliance will not
endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution.
Each healthcare facility shall survey its water usage patterns and requirements
and implement such additional conservation measures as may be possible without
endangering the health of patients or residents to achieve a twenty five
percent (25%) reduction in the institution's water usage. That level of
conservation will be recommended to the city for billing and record. The
established level that does not endanger the health of the patients will be
provided to the city for record.
      4.   Exemptions:
         a.   If compliance with the nonessential use of water restrictions
would result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the water user may
apply for an exemption or variance. For purposes of this section,
"extraordinary hardship" means a permanent damage to property or other personal
or economic loss, which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne
by other water users subject to the nonessential use of water restrictions.
         b.   A person or business entity believing he suffers an extraordinary
hardship and desiring to be wholly or partially exempt from the restrictions on
the nonessential use of water shall submit a written request with full
documentation supporting the need for the requested relief to the city. The
application shall contain information specifying:
            (1)   The nature of the hardship claimed and reason for the
requested exemption or variance.
            (2)   The efforts taken by the applicant to conserve water and the
extent to which the applicant without extraordinary hardship may reduce water
use.
         c.   The city shall advise the applicant of its decision regarding the
application. An exemption or variance will be granted only to the extent
necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship. (Ord. 2005-23, 5-17-2005)

this chapter.
   B.   Service Area Established: The city hereby establishes one service area
consisting of the entire geographical area of the city.

impact fees set forth in section
9-2-2  of this chapter.
   D.   Adjustments:
      1.   A developer may be allowed to receive a credit against or a

a system improvement, builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement,
or dedicates a public facility that the City and the developer agree will
reduce the need for a system improvement. A credit against impact fees shall be
granted for any dedication of land for, improvement to, or new construction of
any system improvement provided by the developer if the facilities are system
improvements or are dedicated to the public and offset the need for an
identified future improvement.
      2.   The city council may adjust the impact fees set forth herein upon a
showing of unusual circumstances and to ensure fairness in the allocation and
imposition of impact fees upon new development. Such adjustment shall be made
only upon specific written request to the city council by persons subject to
payment of such fees and after consideration of such matter by the city council
at a regular meeting of the city council.
      3.   The city council may adjust the amount of impact fees to be paid on
any specific development based upon certified and reliable data and studies
submitted by the developer evidencing that the impact fee imposed is unfair or
not reasonably related to the impacts caused by such new development.

occupancy of that home or structure shall pay all current impact and connection

excess of the maximum fees justified by (and as calculated and set forth in)
the approved impact fee facilities plan and analysis serving as the basis
therefor.

constitute a violation of this title, which is punishable as a class B
misdemeanor and subject to any other civil penalties provided by the applicable
building related code(s). (Ord. 2007-25, 10-3-2007)
10-2-4: OTHER PERMITS OR LICENSES:

erection, construction, reconstruction or alteration of any building or
structure if such building or structure would be in violation of any of the
provisions of this title. Any permit that is granted in violation of this title
shall be null and void. The issuance of a building permit by the city does not
permit the owner to violate restrictive covenants effective as to the property
or lot. It will be the responsibility of the owner to adhere to such
restrictive covenants and any violation of such covenants can be remedied as

provided, that such right of entry shall be exercised only at reasonable hours
and that in no case shall entry be made to any occupied building in the absence
of the owner or a tenant thereof without written permission of the owner or the
written order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The building inspector may
order the construction, erection, reconstruction or alteration to cease
immediately by issue of a stop order on a form to be approved by the city
council. Any person who wilfully continues to construct, reconstruct, erect or
alter after having received notice of the stop order, unless authorized by the
building inspector, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a class C misdemeanor,
for each day that the person continues to construct, reconstruct, erect or
alter on the premises. (Ord., 6-17-1987; amd. 1998 Code; Ord. 2007-25, 10-3-

Planning Commission twice a year, at the February and August meetings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Council or Planning Commission may, at
any time by majority vote, authorize preparation and consideration of proposed
general plan amendments.
      2.   Persons proposing general plan amendments shall do such survey and
analysis work necessary to support the proposed amendment. To ensure that the
Planning Commission and City Council have sufficient information to evaluate
each proposal, an applicant shall submit the following information:
      3.   For map amendments:
         a.   Eight and one-half inch by 11-inch map showing the area of the
proposed amendment;
         b.   Current copy of county assessor's parcel map showing the area of

requirements of this title as applied to a parcel of property that he owns,
leases, or in which he holds some other beneficial interest may apply to the
appeal authority for a variance from the terms of the ordinance.
   B.   Granting Of Variance: The appeal authority may grant a variance only
if:
      1.   Literal enforcement of the ordinance would cause an unreasonable
hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general
purpose of the land use ordinances;
      2.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
      3.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial
property right possessed by other property in the same zone;
      4.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will
not be contrary to the public interest; and
      5.   The spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial
justice done.
   C.   Unreasonable Hardship: In determining whether or not enforcement of the
land use ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship, the appeal authority may
not find an unreasonable hardship unless it finds all of the following:
      1.   The alleged hardship is located on or associated with the property
for which the variance is sought; and
      2.   The alleged hardship comes from circumstances peculiar to the
property, not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood; and
      3.   The hardship is not self-imposed or economic.

circumstances attached to the property, the appeal authority may find that
special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances:

10-4-5: APPEALS PROCEDURE:
   A.   Scope: A party bringing an appeal may allege that there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the land use authority
in the administration or interpretation of the land use ordinance. Appeals to
the appeal authority may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer,
department, board or bureau of the city affected by a decision of the land use
authority administering or interpreting the land use ordinance. However, only
those decisions in which a land use authority has applied a land use ordinance
to a particular application, person, or parcel may be appealed to the appeal
authority.
   B.   Time For Appeal: Appeals must be brought within thirty (30) days after
said decision is rendered or (if the decision is in writing) after the decision
is issued in writing.
   C.   Burden Of Proof: A party bringing an appeal to the appeal authority
must present every theory of relief that the party could raise in district
court, and has the burden of proving that the land use authority erred.
   D.   Standard Of Review: The standard of review to be used by the appeal
authority in reviewing the decision of the land use authority is different for
findings of fact than for questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact.
      1.   For findings of fact, the appeal authority must defer to the factual
findings of the land use authority, and may not reverse these findings of fact
unless the appeal authority finds them to be clearly erroneous because they are
against the clear weight of the evidence.
      2.   For questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact, such as the
interpretation and application of a land use ordinance, the appeal authority is
not required to defer to the land use authority, but must only ascertain that
the question of law, or mixed question of law and fact, was decided correctly.
   E.   Decision On Appeal: The appeal authority shall determine the
correctness of a decision of the land use authority in its interpretation and
application of the land use ordinance. In reaching its decision, the appeal
authority may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly the decision appealed from.
The concurring vote of three (3) members of the appeal authority shall be
necessary in its decision. The decision of the appeal authority shall take
effect and be considered final on the date when the appeal authority issues a
written decision. (Ord. 2007-28, 10-17-2007)
10-4-6: JUDICIAL REVIEW; TIME LIMITATION:
A party may not commence judicial review of land use decisions of the city in
which a land use authority has applied a land use ordinance to a particular
application, person, or parcel, until the aggrieved party has exhausted his
administrative remedies by appealing the decision to the appeal authority as
provided in this chapter. After the appeal authority has rendered its decision,
the city or any person aggrieved by any decision of the appeal authority may
have and maintain a plenary action for relief therefor in any court of
competent jurisdiction, provided a petition for such relief is presented to the
court within thirty (30) days after the written decision of the appeal
authority is issued. Judicial review of the decision of the appeal authority
shall be in conformity with Utah Code Annotated section 10-9a-801. (Ord. 2007-

10-5-4: CITY HISTORIC SITES LIST:
   A.   Designation Of Historic Properties: The commission may designate
historic properties to the Historic Sites List as a means of providing
recognition to, and encouraging the preservation of, historic properties in the
community.
   B.   Criteria For Designating Properties To The City Historic Sites List:
Any district, building, structure, object or site may be designated to the
Historic Sites List if it meets all the criteria outlined below:
      1.   Location: It is located within the official boundaries of the city.
      2.   Age: It is at least fifty (50) years old.
      3.   Historic Integrity:
         a.   It retains its historic integrity, in that there are no major
alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant
historic features. Major alterations that would destroy the historic integrity
include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement
or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, addition of upper stories or
the removal of original upper stories, covering the exterior walls with
nonhistoric materials, moving the resource from its original location to one
that is dissimilar to the original, and additions which significantly detract
from or obscure the original form and appearance of the resource when viewed
from the public way.
         b.   If the property does not meet the integrity requirements outlined
in subsection B3a of this section, it may still qualify for designation if it
meets one of the following requirements for exceptional significance:
            (1)   It is directly associated with events of historic
significance in the community.
            (2)   It is closely associated with the lives of persons who were
of historic importance to the community.
            (3)   It exhibits significant methods of construction or materials
that were used within the historic period.

historic preservation office standards for intensive level surveys (June 1993
version or subsequent revisions); and copies of that documentation have been
placed in the local and state historic preservation files.
   C.   Designation Procedures: Any person, group, or government agency may
nominate a property for listing in the city Historic Sites List. The nomination
and listing procedures are as follows:
      1.   Completed intensive level survey documentation for each nominated
property must be submitted to the commission.
      2.   The commission will review and consider properly submitted
nominations at its next scheduled meeting. The commission will notify the
nominating party, either orally or in writing, one week prior to the meeting
that the nomination will be considered, and will place that item on the agenda
posted for said meeting. The one week notification may be waived at the
nominating party's option in order to accommodate "last minute" submittals.
      3.   The commission will review the documentation for completeness,
accuracy and compliance with subsection B, "Criteria For Designating Properties
To The City Historic Sites List", of this section and will make its decision
accordingly.
   D.   Results Of Designation To The Historic Sites List:
      1.   Owners of officially designated historic sites may obtain a historic
site certificate from the commission. The historic site certificate contains
the historic name of the property, the date of designation, and signatures of
the mayor and the commission chairperson.
      2.   If a historic site is to be demolished or extensively altered,
efforts will be made to document its physical appearance before such action
takes place.
         a.   The city will delay issuing a demolition permit for a maximum of
thirty (30) days and will notify a member of the commission, who will take
responsibility for the documentation.
         b.   Documentation will include, at a minimum, exterior photographs
(both black and white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic
building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the
building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor plan drawing of the
building.
         c.   The demolition permit will be issued after thirty (30) days of
the initial application, whether or not the commission has documented the
building. The permit may be issued earlier if the commission completes its

         d.   The documentation will be kept in the commission's historic site
files, which are open to the public.
   E.   Removal Of Properties From The Historic Sites List: Properties which,
in the opinion of the commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility
may be removed from the Historic Sites List after review and consideration by
the commission. (Ord. 2008-08, 5-21-2008)

4B3a of this chapter, and
            (2)   Meet at least one of the following national register
criteria:
               (A)   Be associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
               (B)   Be associated with the lives of significant persons in our
past; or
               (C)   Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess
high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable
entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
               (D)   Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
important in prehistory or history (e.g., archeological sites).
            (3)   Has been documented according to the Utah state historic
preservation office standards for intensive level surveys (June 1993 version or
subsequent revisions) or national register standards; and a copy of that
documentation has been placed in the local historic preservation files.
      3.   Owner Approval:
         a.   Individual Properties: The owner of the property must approve the
action to designate his/her property to the Historic Landmark Register by
submitting to the commission a written statement to that effect.
         b.   Historic Districts: A majority (i.e., over 50 percent) of the
property owners in a proposed historic district must be in favor of the
designation or at least not opposed to it. Written objections from over fifty
percent (50%) of the property owners will constitute lack of approval and will
halt the designation process.
   C.   Designation Procedures:
      1.   Submittal to the commission of complete intensive level survey or
National Register of Historic Places documentation shall initiate the review
process.
      2.   The commission shall place properly submitted nominations on the
agenda for its next scheduled meeting; and shall notify the nominating party
and the property owner, either orally or in writing, fourteen (14) days prior
to the meeting that the nomination will be considered.

Properties To The City Historic Landmark Register", of this section and may, by
passage of an appropriate resolution, designate properties to the Historic
Landmark Register.
   D.   Notification And Recording Of Designation: Following designation by the
commission, a notice of such shall be mailed to the owners of record, together
with a copy of this chapter. In the case of a historic district designation,
notice of such may be placed in the local newspaper or in a public building
rather than mailed to each owner of property in the district. The commission
shall record the Historic Landmark Register status designation with the county
recorder's office.
   E.   Results Of Designation To The Historic Landmark Register:
      1.   Properties designated to the Historic Landmark Register may receive
special consideration in the granting of zoning variances or conditional use
permits in order to encourage their preservation.
      2.   In the event of rehabilitation of the property, local building
officials will consider waiving certain code requirements in accordance with
the provisions of the building related codes, as adopted by the city and
identified in title 9, chapter 1 of this code, as they apply to or deal with
historic buildings and structures.
      3.   Owners of historic landmarks may seek assistance from the commission
in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their properties.
      4.   Proposed exterior work on historic landmarks is subject to the
review and approval of the commission.
         a.   Purpose: The purpose of this review is to ensure preservation of
historic properties to the greatest degree possible.
         b.   Applicability: This review applies to individually designated
landmark properties or any property, contributing or noncontributing, located
in a landmark designated historic district.
         c.   Exterior Work Requiring Permit: This review applies only to
exterior work which requires a building permit, sign permit, or demolition
permit.
            (1)   Applications for building, demolition, or sign permits
pertaining to landmark properties shall be forwarded by the building inspection
department to the commission prior to their issuance.
            (2)   A permit applicant ("applicant"), which includes the owner of
the property, in order to obtain a permit from the building inspections
department, shall file, with the commission (on a form furnished thereby), a
request for a certificate of appropriateness for rehabilitation or demolition
of a landmark property (hereinafter referred to as a certificate of
appropriateness).
         d.   Application Review: At its next scheduled meeting, the commission
shall review the application and proposed work for compliance with the
"standards for rehabilitation" (hereinafter referred to as the "standards") and
any design guidelines adopted by the commission and the city council.
            (1)   In Compliance: Applicants whose proposed projects comply with
the provisions of this chapter shall be issued a certificate of appropriateness
within ten (10) days, which certificate authorizes the issuance of the
appropriate permit.
            (2)   Not In Compliance:
               (A)   Applicants whose proposed projects are not found to be in
compliance with this chapter shall be offered a negotiating period of sixty
(60) days, during which time the commission and the applicant shall explore all
options for an acceptable solution including, but not limited to, the
feasibility of modifying the plans, using the historic landmark for alternative
purposes, and/or reselling the property to another party.
               (B)   The commission may extend the negotiating period an
additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described above if deemed necessary
to accommodate a potential solution.
               (C)   If no solution has been agreed upon at the conclusion of
either the initial sixty (60) day period or the full one hundred twenty (120)
day period, the certificate of appropriateness will be denied; and the building
official shall not issue any permits.
         e.   Claims Of Economic Hardship: The commission may approve a
certificate of appropriateness if the applicant has presented substantial
evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will result from
denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
            (1)   Economic Hardship Criteria: In order to sustain a claim of
unreasonable economic hardship, the commission may require the applicant to
provide information as to whether the property is capable of producing a
reasonable return for the applicant.
            (2)   Demonstration Of Economic Hardship: Demonstration of economic
hardship by the applicant shall not be based on conditions resulting from
wilful or negligent acts by the applicant, purchasing the property for
substantially more than market value at the time of purchase, failure to
perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to diligently solicit and
retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant improvements.
         f.   Appeal: An applicant who has been denied any permit by the
building official, based on the commission's refusal to issue a certificate of
appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the city council. The appeal must
be made on or before thirty (30) days after the commission's decision.
   F.   Removal Of Properties From The Historic Landmark Register: Properties
which, in the opinion of the commission, no longer meet the criteria for
eligibility may be removed from the Historic Landmark Register after review and
consideration by the commission.
   G.   Enforcement: The provisions of this section are subject to the
enforcement provisions established in the applicable building related codes, as
adopted by the city and identified in title 9, chapter 1 of this code. (Ord.

10-5-6: STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Determining Historic Appropriateness: The following standards and
guidelines shall be used by the commission in determining the historic
appropriateness of any application pertaining to historic landmark properties.
      1.   This includes individually designated landmark properties and both
contributing and noncontributing properties in landmark designated historic
districts.
      2.   In approving an application for a certificate of appropriateness,
the commission shall find that the project substantially complies with all of
the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application and that
the decision is in the best interest of the city.
   B.   Standards For Rehabilitation: These standards are based on the
"Secretary Of The Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation", which serve as a
national and state model for appropriate preservation treatment. The standards
are as follows:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      5.   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
      7.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      8.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      9.   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(For further details see "The Secretary Of The Interior's Standards For
Rehabilitation And Guidelines For Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" [1990 or
more recent version].)
   C.   General Design Guidelines:
      1.   Landmark Buildings And Contributing Buildings In Landmark Designated
Historic Districts:
         a.   Avoid demolition of landmark and contributing buildings. They are
a finite resource and cannot be replaced.
         b.   Vacant buildings should be weather and vandal proofed in order to
minimize further deterioration and the threat to public safety.
         c.   Rehabilitation work, especially on the exterior and the principal
facade, should: 1) preserve existing historic features or 2) replace existing
historic features only if absolutely necessary (and then only with features and
materials known to have existed on the building). Avoid "dressing up" buildings
by adding features based on speculation.
         d.   Avoid moving buildings whenever possible, especially to create
artificial groupings of historic buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new
site should be similar to the original site; and the original setback and
orientation of the building on the lot should be replicated.
      2.   Additions To Landmark And Contributing Buildings And Construction Of
New Buildings Within A Historic District:
         a.   Scale Of New Additions: New additions to landmark and
contributing buildings should be subordinate to the original building, i.e.,
lower in height, attached to the rear or set back along the side, and
subordinate in scale and architectural detailing.
         b.   Compatibility With Historic Buildings And Overall Streetscape:
Height, width, setback, roof shape, and the overall scale and massing of new
buildings should be compatible with surrounding historic buildings and the
overall streetscape.
         c.   Materials On Primary Facade(s): Materials on at least the primary
facade(s) should be similar to original materials on facades of surrounding
historic buildings (usually brick, stucco, stone, or wood siding, depending on
the specific characteristics of the district).
         d.   Architectural Details: Architectural details (including wood or
metal trim, porches, cornices, arches, window and door features, etc.) should
not replicate historic features on surrounding historic buildings.
         e.   Window And Door Openings: Window and door openings should be
similar in size and orientation (vertical or horizontal) to openings on
historic buildings, and should take up about the same percentage of the overall
facade as those on surrounding historic buildings.
         f.   Proportion Of Principal Facades: The relationship of the width to
the height of the principal elevations shall be in scale with surrounding
structures and streetscape. Wider new buildings can be divided into segments
that more closely resemble the facade widths of historic buildings.
         g.   Roof Shape: The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with the surrounding structures and streetscape. Unusual roof
shapes, pitches, and colors are discouraged. (Ord. 2008-08, 5-21-2008)

city in accordance with its ordinances and specifications, shall be required on
any existing or proposed street adjoining a lot on which a building permit
application for new home construction is made. Such curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
and street improvements shall be required as a condition of obtaining approval
of the building permit. The city may require a property owner to make an
equivalent payment for the labor and materials necessary to install curb,
gutter, sidewalk and asphalt, as calculated by the city engineer, in lieu of
requiring the property owner to install the requisite amount of curb, gutter,
sidewalk and asphalt, when in the city's judgment it would not be cost
effective for the city to require actual installation of curb, gutter, sidewalk
or asphalt because the adjoining streets have not yet been improved to current
city standards, and/or requiring such improvements would of necessity result in
the destruction or removal of said improvements within the near future when
adjoining streets are improved to city standards. Under this scenario, the city
shall require payment by a property owner equal in amount to the actual costs
for labor and materials necessary to install the required amount of curb,
gutter, sidewalk and asphalt as of the date the property owner requests
approval of a building permit. Prior to receiving approval of the building
permit where improvements are required, a property owner must also convey to
the city by quitclaim deed, the amount of property necessary to install curb,
gutter, sidewalk and asphalt whether for immediate installation or for such
future time as it becomes prudent for the city to install the said

owner of said lot or parcel of property cannot reside on the property as his or
her primary residence: the requirements of this subsection shall be satisfied
if a person residing on the lot or parcel of property possesses legal authority
to make decisions, and enforce judgments and legal determinations, concerning
the property or structures thereon, including but not limited to a holder of a

10-7A-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The purposes of the provisions of this chapter are: 1) to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents while
protecting and preserving significant scenic resources for the long term
benefit of LaVerkin City as a whole; and 2) to further the goals and policies
of the general plan in relation to land use, densities, open space and
community image.
   B.   Intent: The standards set forth herein are intended to achieve the
following objectives:
      1.   Minimize adverse soil and slope instability; decrease the potential
for erosion; and prohibit activities and uses that would result in the
degradation of fragile soils and steep slopes.
      2.   Protect and preserve the visual resources which are of significant
value to the community. Such resources include, but are not limited to, major
hillsides, hilltops, ridges and ridgelines, knolls, mesas, cuestas and
escarpments, boulder outcroppings and large boulders, canyons and natural
drainage areas, and other areas of historical or visual significance. Retain
the integrity of significant on site and off site views to or from these
resources.
      3.   Minimize the adverse effects of grading and cut and fill operations;
avoid highly visible scarring of hillsides; and protect natural vegetation,
sensitive hydrologic features, and visually prominent landforms.
      4.   Discourage mass grading and terracing of large pads but permit
flexibility for reasonable development practices as appropriate.
      5.   Establish a hillside development process that requires applicants to
select suitable development sites on their property through the use of slope
calculations, maximum land holding capacity, or development agreements to
determine the appropriate density, intensity, design and location of structures
and improvements.
      6.   Provide hillside development standards that maximize the positive
impacts of site sensitive design, grading, landscape architecture, and building
architecture, that will protect the inherent scenic value in the proposed
projects subject to this chapter.
      7.   Permit the flexibility to modify or remove relatively small
topographic features which have slopes distinctly different from surrounding
property in order to facilitate reasonably efficient development in a
particular area. The exclusion of such features or areas shall not be contrary
to the overall purpose of this chapter.
      8.   Encourage the appropriate location, design and development of
proposed projects which provide enhanced human enjoyment, while protecting
people and property from hazardous conditions, including rockfalls, rolling
boulders, unstable slopes, landslides, mudslides, flooding, and erosion.
      9.   Minimize the impacts of development to the surrounding natural
environment by controlling the location, intensity, pattern, design,
construction techniques, and materials of development. (Ord. 2013-03, 4-3-2013)

a noise or visual barrier.
BUILDING HEIGHT: The vertical distance measured from the ground level grade to
the top of the building.
CLUSTERING: A land planning technique appropriate for large subdivisions in
which some areas are reserved as open space. This allows the permitted units in
an area to be grouped more densely in the most developable parts of a site.
CONTOUR: A line drawn on a plan that connects all points of equal elevation.
CONTOUR GRADING: A grading concept designed to result in earth forms that
resemble natural terrain characteristics. Horizontal and vertical curve
variations are often used for slope banks. Contour grading is not necessarily
minimal grading.
CUESTA: A landform that has a steep ascent in one direction and a gentle
descent in the opposite direction. The steep slope is the cuesta face and
erosion escarpment, and the gentle descent is the back slope of the cuesta. The
crest of the cuesta forms a ridgeline.
CUT: The mechanical removal of soil, rock or other earth material.
CUT AND FILL: The excavating of earth material in one place as cut and
depositing of it as fill in an adjacent place.
DEVELOPMENT: The carrying out of any building activity or clearing of land as
an adjunct of construction. "Major development" shall be considered to be
subdivision platting, including various land uses and/or housing types.
DEVELOPMENT PARCEL: Any quantity of land capable of being described with such
definiteness that its location and boundaries may be established, which is
designated by its owner or developer as land to be used or developed as a unit
or which has been used or developed as a unit.

are worn away and moved from one place to another by natural forces such as
weathering, solution and transportation.
ESCARPMENT: A long cliff or steep slope resulting from erosion or faulting,
separating two (2) comparatively level or more gently sloping surfaces.
EXCAVATION, MAJOR/MINOR: Any disturbance to the ground, including, but not
limited to, clearing, grubbing, rock removal, cutting, tunneling, drilling or
any other activity which alters the natural ground. "Minor excavation" shall

result.
MESA: A typically flat topped landform with generally steep sides.
MINIMAL GRADING: A grading technique designed to minimize excavation and fill.
Allows the movement of earth for projects such as individual building
foundations, driveways, local roads, and utility excavation. It is often
associated with roads conforming closely to natural contours and structures
being integrated into the natural terrain.
NATIVE VEGETATION: The natural vegetation commonly found in the area.

that are a part of this chapter, in cases of conflict between the provisions of
this chapter and other established regulations, the most restrictive provisions
shall apply.
   B.   Exemptions: The following actions and activities are exempt from the
application procedure of this chapter. However, while these actions are exempt
from specific requirements, the development standards necessary to accomplish
the purpose and intent of this chapter shall be met (e.g., the mitigation of
disturbed areas that are not planned for development in the foreseeable
future). Development plans shall be submitted to city staff for review to
determine possible mitigation requirements prior to any actions or activities
taking place.
      1.   Construction or minor excavation that does not require a grading
permit or a building permit.
      2.   The construction and installation (trenching, utility construction
and backfilling) of underground utility systems.
      3.   The regrading of existing lots for landscape installation provided
such regraded area is within the buildable area of the development.
      4.   Pool/spa construction that does not involve the construction of any
retaining walls over four feet (4') in height, whether or not such retaining
walls are part of the pool structure.
      5.   Additions to existing structures and/or construction of accessory
structures within the buildable area of a lot unless a grading permit for
establishment of same is required.
      6.   Any project that has received final city approval prior to the
effective date of this chapter, provided that such permit or approval has not
expired, is not otherwise revoked, and is in compliance with any requirements
that this chapter supersedes.
      7.   The construction of a public street identified in the LaVerkin City
general plan and/or transportation master plan that is not part of any overall
development project (e.g., a street proposed primarily for improved circulation
within the city and not to provide access to any particular parcel or
development).
   C.   Hillside Classification Standards: Each slope category range delineates
the relative suitability of land for development.
      1.   The slope categories are described as follows:
         a.   0% to 20%; flat to gently rolling land: Development with grading
is permitted in this slope category. Padded building sites are permitted;
however, on slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), techniques such as
contour grading, split level architectural prototypes where feasible, or
grading for the structure pad only, shall be used to reduce cut and fill.
         b.   20.01% to 25%; moderate hillside: Special hillside architectural
and design techniques that minimize grading and harmonize with the built and
natural environments are required in this slope category. Architectural
prototypes and infrastructure elements are expected to complement the natural
landform by using techniques required herein. Impact of streets and trails is
to be minimized by following natural contours where practicable.
         c.   25.01% to 30%; hillside: Development within this slope category
shall be limited to slopes where it can be demonstrated that safety,
environmental, and aesthetic impacts can be minimized. The use of planning, and
design techniques such as larger lots, and appropriate building structural
techniques (e.g., stepped slabs, pole foundations, etc.) are expected.
Structures shall blend with the natural environment through their shape,
materials, and colors. Impact of streets and trails are to be minimized by
following natural contours where practicable.
         d.   30.01% to 40%; steep hillside: This is a sensitive slope
condition and development is prohibited.
         e.   Greater than 40%; mountainous: This is a severe slope condition

   F.   Penalties: The director of operations or his designee shall have the
right to order a halt to construction of any improvements within a hillside
development where, in his opinion, there exists a condition which violates or
threatens to violate any of the provisions of this chapter. Such suspension of
construction activities shall continue until the director of operations or his
designee is satisfied that measures have been implemented for substantial
compliance with this chapter.
   G.   Bonding, Easement, And Restoration:
      1.   A surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit to assure
hillside restoration shall be provided prior to issuance of a hillside
development permit, along with a temporary travel, access, and construction
easement ("temporary easement") to and upon the property to be developed.
         a.   Financial Guarantee:
            (1)   Such financial guarantee shall be provided in an amount
sufficient to ensure necessary removal of dumped materials, completion of
revegetation projects, soil stabilization, the construction of stormwater
drainage facilities, other hazard mitigation measures including grading,
planting and maintenance, in the event the developer fails to complete the
hillside restoration in accordance with the approved plan within two (2) years
from the issuance of the permit; provided, that the city council may grant such
additional time extension as may be necessary to allow completion of the
restoration work in the event significant progress toward completion of the
project is underway.
            (2)   The financial guarantee shall cover and be in force for a
period of three (3) years from the issuance of the hillside development permit;
provided, however, that any extension in time for performance granted by the
city shall require and be conditioned on the granting, by the developer, of an
extension in the duration of the financial guarantee that at least equals the
amount of the duration of time for performance requested and granted.
            (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection G1a(2) of this
section, the city shall release its interest in the financial guarantee (or
portion thereof remaining), for restoration purposes, at any time that the
excavated or affected area of the development property is restored and accepted
as complete by the mayor, city administrator, or designee thereof.
            (4)   The surety bond, cash bond, or letter of credit shall cover
the cost, as estimated by an approved landscape architect, or a geotechnical
engineer and approved by the city engineer, to restore the hillside to an
acceptable level of appearance and stability. In the case of a dispute over
what constitutes an acceptable level of restoration, the decision of the city
administrator shall be determinative.
         b.   Temporary Easement:
            (1)   Such temporary travel, access, and construction easement
("temporary easement") shall: a) be granted by the property owner(s) of the
property subject to the development request, b) run with the land, c) be in
writing, d) be recorded in the office of the county recorder, e) apply to and
cover the property subject to development approval, and f) be in force for a
period of three (3) years from the issuance of the hillside development permit;
provided, that:
               (A)   Any extension in time to perform under subsection G1b(1)
of this section shall require and be subject to the granting by the property
owner(s) of an additional and similar temporary easement to the city in the
amount of time requested and granted, to run and continue from the end of time
covered and granted under any such current temporary easement to the city from
the property owner(s); and
               (B)   The city may release its interest in such temporary
easement prior to the expiration of such documented easement, upon request, if
and when the hillside restoration has been accepted as complete by the city and
the restoration bond has been released.
            (2)   The temporary easement shall be granted to allow the city and
its officials, employees, and contracted personnel to enter and remain upon the
development property for purpose of: a) performing required unperformed
hillside restoration, and removal and disposition of soils, vegetation and
other debris that are deemed necessary by the city to complete such hillside
restoration; b) traveling in, out, and upon said property for the duration of
such hillside restoration related surveying, engineering, construction, and
removal of soils, vegetation, and debris; and c) parking city and other
construction vehicles thereon, as needed for such hillside restoration, for the
duration of such restoration efforts of the city and those contracted
therewith.
            (3)   The rights granted pursuant to the temporary easement shall
only be exercised by the city, and those taking thereunder, in the event that
the hillside is not restored according to the approved restoration plan during
the two (2) years following issuance of the hillside development permit.
      2.   In the event the developer fails to complete the hillside
restoration to the satisfaction of the city, within two (2) years following the
issuance of the hillside development permit, the city shall have the right to
exercise its rights under the temporary easement and call upon and use the
proceeds of the financial guarantee (provided for hereinabove) to:
         a.   Restore all cuts with existing soil to approximate the natural
lay of the land. If safety issues remain, brick, rock, block, stone, other
natural materials may be used to create a safe slope.
         b.   Revegetate all disturbed earth with grasses such as perennial
rye, blue or fescue and/or shrubs like creosote, Apache plume, or Mormon tea.
Other appropriate grasses and shrubs may also be approved by the city council.
   H.   Enforcement: The city may enter legal proceedings to require any person
who violates this chapter to fund and return a site to the condition found
prior to any disturbance. The city administrator, or his designee, shall
determine when this natural state has been achieved, or shall set specific
requirements necessary to achieve the natural and restored state. Legal
proceedings may also seek to impose and collect a fine in order to recover
staff costs incurred through addressing any violation of this section.
   I.   Plan Certification: City staff designated to grant approval shall
certify the concept plan and issue a hillside development permit following
approval by the planning commission and city council. The following technical
reports and plans shall be certified as described prior to final plat approval,
certification of the concept plan and issuance of a hillside development permit
or building permit.
      1.   Grading Plan Certification: Upon completion of rough grading work
and prior to any excavation for foundations or structures, an as graded plan
prepared and certified by the Utah licensed civil engineer who prepared the
approved grading plans shall be submitted to the operations department for
review and approval. The as graded plans shall include original ground surface
elevations, as graded surface elevations and all other features that were a
part of the approved grading plan. The engineer shall provide certification on
the as graded plan that the work was done in accordance with the approved
grading plan and the city's grading requirements.
      2.   Landscape Plan Certification: Landscape and irrigation plans shall
be prepared by a licensed landscape architect and shall be submitted to and
approved by the operations department. A Utah licensed landscape architect
shall certify that the plans comply with the city's water conservation and
landscape requirements.
      3.   Drainage Plan Certification: The drainage plan shall be approved by
the city engineer. The plan shall be prepared in conformance with guidelines
available in the city engineer's office. The point of location where the
natural drainage channel enters and leaves the property may not be changed
without approval of the city engineer.
      4.   Construction Drawings And Improvements Plan Certification: The
construction drawings and improvements plan shall be reviewed and approved by
the city engineer. The city engineer shall verify that any existing buildings
or structures, and all roads, easements and drainage channels on the property
where the work is to be performed or on adjacent properties is accurately
illustrated and described.
      5.   Other Certification: Other reports deemed necessary by the
individual or body designated to grant approval may require certification. If
necessary, any requirements for approval will be described at the time of the
initial written request for additional technical reports, and certification
will depend on the procedure, conditions, or terms described therein.
   J.   Engineer Review:
      1.   The city engineer shall:
         a.   Review the plans, reports, and certifications (PR&C) required by
the city in accordance with the provisions of subsections D and I of this
section; and
         b.   Identify any portions of such PR&C which: 1) are incomplete, 2)
require greater specificity, and/or 3) inadequately address the relevant
requirements of this code; and
         c.   After such review, identify any conditions, on or related to the
property to be developed, which prohibit or limit development (e.g., high water
table, blue clay conditions, etc.) and should be noted or otherwise included on
the plat and made a matter for public notice, to protect subsequent owners,
builders, caretakers, and/or developers of said property (e.g., plats;
covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs); deed restrictions and
covenants; and/or notices of interest filed with the county recorder); and
         d.   After consultation with the city attorney, as needed, recommend:
            (1)   Prohibitions and/or limitations on development, and
            (2)   Reasonable mitigation and notification requirements to
effectuate the purposes and concerns of subsection J1c of this section,
regardless of whether such requirement is specifically set forth in this code.
      2.   The recommendations of the city engineer, under subsection J1d of
this section, shall:
         a.   Supplement the specific requirements of this code; and
         b.   Carry a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness, and, unless
successfully rebutted under subsection J3 of this section, shall constitute
requirements of the city with regards to the proposed development of the
property.
      3.   A developer who disagrees with the recommendation of the city
engineer may challenge such recommendation as unreasonable, unnecessary, and/or
unduly burdensome; or on the basis that the condition or restriction to which
the recommendation can, through proper and legitimate engineering and/or
architectural/landscape design, be adequately and appropriately addressed and/
or mitigated through a reasonable and more affordable alternative, approach, or
solution. To do so, the developer shall submit, in writing: a) the developer's
disagreement and the factual and legal basis therefor; b) an alternative
method, approach, or solution, if any; and c) the desired resolution of the
disagreement.
         a.   Informal: If the city engineer is persuaded by the submittal(s),
the city engineer may: 1) withdraw, alter, or alter with conditions said
recommendation; and/or 2) adopt or suggest the submitted, or another
reasonable, alternative recommendation.
         b.   Formal:
            (1)   If the city engineer disagrees with the developer and does
not alter said recommendation, the developer may:
               (A)   Accept the determination of the city engineer as final; or
               (B)   Contest the recommendation; and submit proposed
engineering plans and/or architectural designs (stamped by a licensed engineer
and/or architect [as appropriate]), for consideration by the city engineer, in
support of the developer's claim, dispute, or suggested alternative.
            (2)   If the city engineer still disagrees with the developer's
claim, dispute, or suggested alternative, the developer may:
               (A)   Retain the services of a second qualified engineer or
architect, to study the matter and submit his or her opinions, findings, and
recommendations to the city engineer for consideration;
               (B)   Request that the city and the developer (at the city's
option) secure the services of another qualified engineer or architect, as
appropriate, with the expenses thereof to be shared, as agreed, by and among
the parties to the dispute or controversy (including the city), to study the
matter and to submit his or her opinions, findings, and recommendations to the
city engineer for consideration;
               (C)   Request that the city's land use authority consider the
matter and waive, or waive with conditions, required compliance with the
recommendation of the city engineer; and/or
               (D)   Appeal in accordance with the terms and provisions of
subsection L of this section.
   K.   Notice And Liability Issues:
      1.   Where the city engineer, planning commission, and/or city council
has identified any condition(s), on or related to the property to be developed,
which do(es) or should prohibit or limit development (e.g., high water table,
blue clay conditions, etc.), the city may, as appropriate:
         a.   Deny development; or
         b.   Approve the development, with or without conditions.
      2.   Where a development is approved under or in accordance with the
provisions of subsection K1b of this section, the city, in order to limit its
own liability and to afford reasonable notice to subsequent owners, builders,
caretakers, and/or developers of the property to be developed (and those
providing financing therefor), may require the developer to:
         a.   Provide the city with a release, waiver, hold harmless, and
covenant not to sue (document), acceptable to the city attorney, assuming
responsibility and liability for the development and any harm that may be
occasioned to themselves or others, for a period of ten (10) years from the
date thereof, as a result of such condition(s) as are identified by the city
engineer under the provisions of subsection J of this section. (This shall be
required when the city engineer has recommended against construction on or
development of the land, and the city determines to grant approval.);
         b.   Note such condition(s) on the subdivision plat(s) and site plan
(s) to be approved (if any);
         c.   Make such condition(s), and any required restriction(s) to
address such condition(s) (such as a prohibition against basements, certain
types of water intensive activities which may lead to drainage problems or
soils instability, etc.), a matter of public record through one or more of the
following methods, as determined reasonable and appropriate by the city:
covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs); deed restrictions and
covenants; and/or notices of interest filed with the county recorder; and/or
         d.   Note on the documents referenced in subsections K2b and K2c of
this section that there is one or more specified conditions on the property
which may restrict or prohibit development, and that a property owner, in
purchasing and/or taking ownership in the property, assumes liability for the
specified condition and for making financiers of the property and the owner's
successors in interest aware of the condition on the property when financing,
refinancing, or conveying his or her interest in the property.
   L.   Appeals:
      1.   In the event of a disagreement with the requirements imposed by city
staff, the city engineer, the planning commission, or city council in
connection with this chapter, an applicant may appeal the matter to the
appropriate and relevant administrative appeals body of the city for relief
(e.g., the board of adjustment, for land use and zoning matters; or the board
of appeals, for building related code matters).
      2.   In the event the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the
board of adjustment pertaining to a hillside development permit, the applicant
may appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction as permitted by
section 10-9a-704, Utah Code Annotated (1953, as amended).
   M.   Verification Of Compliance: For developments on a "development parcel"
to which this chapter applies, as defined in section
10-7A-2 of this chapter, certification by a Utah licensed engineer that the
development has been completed in compliance with the approved hillside
development permit, including satisfaction of any conditions contained in the
permit, shall be required. Restoration bonds shall not be released, and
certificates of occupancy shall be withheld for such a development, until such
certification has been received by the city engineer. (Ord. 2013-03, 4-3-2013)
10-7A-5: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All proposed development and improvements subject to the provisions of this
chapter are subject to the following required development standards. These
standards are intended to provide a framework for development that is sensitive
to the unique characteristics of hillside properties. Their purpose is not to
discourage proposals for innovative or alternative methods of design in a
hillside area; innovation is encouraged as long as the end result is one which
respects significant landform features and is consistent with the purposes
expressed in this chapter and in the goals and objectives of the LaVerkin City
general plan (chapters 2 and 3).
   A.   Disturbance Limitations: The following criteria shall be applied in
establishing the limits of disturbance for a site:
      1.   Adverse visual impacts shall be minimized as much as possible. The
screening of cuts and fills, and the visual protection of prominent ridgelines,
rock outcroppings, scenic views, and as much of the natural terrain as
practicable is required.
      2.   Disturbed slopes shall be treated to minimize erosion, and natural
drainageways shall be protected as much as possible.
      3.   The clearing of trees, shrubs and other native vegetation shall be
limited to: the approved locations for streets, driveways and easements; the
approved locations for building pads for structures, main buildings and
accessory structures; and the minimum distance between structures and
surrounding vegetation for established fire prevention and safety standards or
recommendations.
      4.   Significant trees, shrubs and other native vegetation shall be
preserved in the design of the development. Significant vegetation is to be
identified on a map with the application submittals and city staff will review
the submittals and visit the site to determine the significance of existing
vegetation.
      5.   The limits of disturbance may have borders or edges as long as the
significant features of the natural terrain are being preserved.
      6.   All topsoil from any disturbed portion of the site shall be
preserved and utilized in revegetation areas. The soil in the upper portion of
fill areas shall be of a sufficient quality to support native plant growth.
      7.   The maximum limits of disturbance shall be identified on each lot or
parcel of the approved site plans and subdivision plats and shall include all
graded, excavated, and filled areas, the areas occupied by main and accessory
structures, hard surface areas that include driveways, walkways, patios and
parking areas, and all other areas of disturbance or nonnative vegetation.
   B.   Grading Design: Grading for all developments shall be designed to blend
with the contours of the adjacent natural terrain.
      1.   Limits Of Grading: No grading, cutting, filling, excavating,
benching or terracing of any proposed lot or parcel shall go beyond the maximum
limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel as provided herein.
      2.   Cuts And Fills: All cuts and fills shall be minimized as much as
practicable and shall be included within the maximum limits of disturbance for
each lot or parcel. All cut and fill areas shall be recontoured to the natural,
varied contours of the surrounding terrain with a maximum slope transition back
to the natural grade no greater than two to one (2:1). Slope ratios greater
than two to one (2:1) are prohibited except for approved cuts into solid rock
only. Any such proposed cut into rock shall be reviewed by planning commission
with recommendation to city council for appropriateness, suitability, and
visual impact in order to grant approval if warranted. For approved cuts into
solid rock, the slope may be as steep as one-half to one (1/2:1) if recommended
by a Utah licensed professional engineer who is trained and experienced in the
practice of geotechnical engineering and if the visual impact of the cut can be
adequately mitigated. All areas of cut and fill shall be protected from erosion
during the period of construction and shall be permanently planted or otherwise
protected from erosion within twenty (20) days of the completion of grading and
excavation as identified by the approved landscape plan.
Where cut or fill conditions are created, slopes shall be varied where feasible
rather than left at a constant angle which may be unstable or create an
unnatural, rigid, engineered appearance. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 1 of this chapter.)
      3.   Cuts And Fills Visual Mitigation: The visual impact of cuts and
fills shall be mitigated by methods approved by the city engineer. This
mitigation may include, but is not limited to, the placement of buildings in
front of the cuts and/or the placement of retaining walls designed to blend
with the surrounding terrain to stabilize the cut. Mitigation shall
predominantly be contour grading along with plantings as identified on the
approved landscape plan that will stabilize the cut or fill slope and blend
with the surrounding vegetation. The use of retaining walls is to be as limited
in scope and height as feasible to ensure the visual predominance of
vegetation. Contour grading techniques shall be used to provide a natural
appearing variety of slope transitions, slope percentage and slope direction in
a three- dimensional, undulating pattern similar to existing, adjacent terrain.
         a.   Hard edges left by cut and fill operations shall be given a
rounded appearance that closely resembles the natural contours of the land.
(See section
10-7A-6, figure 2 of this chapter.)
         b.   Manmade slopes adjacent to roadways shall be softened where
feasible by sufficient berms, contour grading, and/or landscaping to create
visually interesting and pleasing streetscapes. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 3 of this chapter.)
      4.   Street And Driveway Alignment: Street alignments shall run generally
parallel along the contours of the natural terrain as much as practicable.
Short sections of streets that run perpendicular to natural contours and serve
the purpose of connecting main parallel sections of streets are permitted and
shall follow the natural curves of drainageways where practicable. Streets
shall not greatly alter the physical and visual character of a hillside by
creating large notches in ridgelines or by defining wide straight alignments.
Contour grading techniques shall be employed on all streets and associated cut
and fill areas to minimize any adverse impacts. The portions of driveways that
run perpendicular to natural contours and serve the purpose of accessing
building lots and parcels shall be as short as practicable. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 4 of this chapter.)
      5.   Open Space Trails: Where permitted, trails through open space shall
be located such that cuts and fills are minimized and visual character is
preserved. Where cuts and fills are required, cut conditions uphill from the
trail typically have less of an overall visual impact than an exposed downhill
fill area.
      6.   Structure Location: Design of building sites shall be sensitive to
the natural terrain. Structures shall be located in such a way as to minimize
grading and to preserve natural features. Careful consideration shall be given
to the general orientation of the slope when locating structures. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 5 of this chapter.)
      7.   Building Sites: On each building site, careful consideration shall
be given to the cut and fill conditions such that a balance is achieved where
feasible and consistent with the intent of this chapter to minimize the visual
impact of grading. Different slope conditions call for corresponding typical
cut and fill solutions such that the structure fits well into the topography as
illustrated below. Impacts to natural drainageways shall be avoided where
possible. (See section
10-7A-6, figures 6 and 6A of this chapter.)
   C.   Viewshed Protection: To minimize the adverse visual impacts that
development may potentially have on prominent ridgelines, mesas, and other site
features, the following setbacks shall apply: Reserved.
   D.   Architectural Standards: The purpose of establishing architectural
design standards in improvements and developments subject to this chapter is to
ensure quality development that blends with the hillside environment and to
create neighborhoods that display harmonious and complementary architectural
styles. To achieve hillside compatible development, the city recognizes the
importance of having architectural design that incorporates rooflines and other
building elements that reflect the naturally occurring ridgeline silhouettes
and topographical variations.
      1.   Building Orientation: A variety of building and lot orientations
shall be provided in order to encourage development suitable with the hillside
character of the site.
         a.   Structures shall be designed so the slope angle of the roof pitch
is generally less than or equal to the angle of the natural hillside or manmade
slope. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 8 of this chapter.)
         b.   Site planning shall emphasize the preservation of views to
prominent visual features such as ridgelines. This includes building
orientation to allow view opportunities and lot development on the least
sensitive portions of the site to preserve landforms, vegetation and
topographical features.
         c.   Hillside adaptive architecture shall be terraced to follow the
contours of the slope. Exterior structural supports and undersides of floors
and decks not enclosed by walls are discouraged but may be permitted with fire
safety and architectural considerations adequately addressed to the
satisfaction of the city individual or body designated to grant approval.
      2.   Building Style: The use of hillside adaptive architecture as needed
shall be incorporated into the design of individual lots. Step building
foundations may be required to minimize grading. (See section
10-7A-6, figures 9, 10, and 11 of this chapter.)
         a.   Architectural styles shall be compatible with the hillside
character, topography, and look of the community.
         b.   The dimensions of a building, measured in the direction of the
slope, shall be minimized in order to limit the amount of cut and fill and to
better incorporate the structure to the natural terrain.
      3.   Fencing And Privacy Walls: All fences and privacy walls adjacent to
or clearly visible from public roads or parks shall be constructed of
decorative masonry or other approved materials which have a natural appearance
and shall be a color that blends with the surrounding environment and is
complementary to the landscape. The applicant shall present illustrations and
descriptions of fencing and wall materials as required by this section.
All walls and fences which are adjacent to or visible from public roads shall
be set back from the right of way a minimum of ten feet (10') and landscaped on
the street side of the wall or fence. A minimum flat area from top or toe of
slope of three feet (3') or more as required by the adopted building codes of
the city shall be maintained to face of wall on common area maintenance slopes
with slope heights of thirty feet (30') or greater. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 12 of this chapter.)
   E.   Landscape Design Standards: Landscape materials and stabilization of
graded slopes shall be designed to be compatible with surrounding natural
vegetation. Plant material shall be selected according to compatible climatic,
soil and ecological characteristics of the region.
   F.   Retaining Walls: The purpose and intent of establishing development
standards for retaining walls is to ensure that the application of retaining
walls are aesthetically pleasing elements within the subject property and
limited in quantity throughout a development. The location of all retaining
walls, privacy walls and fences shall be identified along with their proposed
heights, materials and colors, and shown on the grading plan and concept plan.
All retaining walls, privacy walls and fences shall be located within the
maximum limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel.
      1.   General Standards:
         a.   Retaining walls shall be used for the purpose of containing fill
material or for minimizing cut or fill slopes. The retaining wall may only
extend six inches (6") above the material it is retaining.
         b.   A retaining wall shall not be constructed in such a manner so as
to block or restrict vehicular access to a dedicated or implied dedicated
alley, accessway, pedestrian access, trail, sidewalk, easement, or right of
way.
         c.   All retaining walls and all privacy walls and fences surrounding
a development's perimeter shall be faced with stone or earth colored materials
complementary to the surrounding natural landscape.
         d.   Retaining walls shall follow the natural contours of the slope
where feasible. Curved walls that follow the natural contours are recommended
but not required.
         e.   All retaining walls as well as all freestanding walls and fences
shall comply with the adopted building codes of the city.
      2.   Height Standards:
         a.   No retaining wall for a cut or fill area shall exceed ten feet
(10') in height as measured from the immediately adjacent lowest natural or
finished grade to the top of wall unless it can be demonstrated in the overall
mitigation plan for cuts and fills that taller walls will not detract from the
surrounding terrain and there is a predominance of vegetation in the fill
areas. Retaining walls shall not be stacked or terraced in any manner that
increases their combined height beyond ten feet (10'). If desired, two (2)
subwalls may be stacked or terraced to a maximum combined height of ten feet
(10'). A minimum separation of six feet (6') is required between subwalls as
measured from face of wall. (See section
10-7A-6, figure 13 of this chapter.)
         b.   For purposes of this subsection, retaining walls are not
considered stacked or terraced if there is a minimum horizontal separation of
ten feet (10') between sets of retaining walls. With the minimum ten foot (10')
separation, each retaining wall set may be constructed to the maximum allowed
height; either the ten foot (10') height or the taller height demonstrated that
would not detract from the surrounding terrain. The separation area between the
sets of retaining walls shall be planted with low water use/low maintenance
shrubs or other vegetation as approved in the landscape plan. Trees are not to
be planted in the zone between terraced walls unless the distance between walls
is a minimum of twenty feet (20'). This vegetation will help reduce the
apparent visual height of the wall or walls.
         c.   Retaining walls may be constructed to varying heights throughout
a development.
            (1)   Retaining walls constructed in the side yard area of a lot
shall maintain a maximum retaining wall height of four feet (4'); provided that
such wall does not extend into a required front yard adjacent to a street.
            (2)   Retaining walls constructed in the rear yard area of a lot
shall maintain a maximum retaining wall height of eight feet (8').
            (3)   All planting areas between and adjacent to retaining walls
shall be provided with an automatic irrigation system suitable for low water
use vegetation. Such irrigation system shall be approved and inspected prior to
the construction of any wall.
            (4)   Where a retaining wall contains fill above the natural grade
and is located within a required setback yard, the height of the retaining wall
shall be considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence or
wall at that location. A non- view obscuring fence up to three and one-half
feet (3.5') in height may be erected at the top of the retaining wall for
safety.
         d.   Retaining walls not exceeding six feet (6') in height are
permitted adjacent to structures in order to provide a private outdoor area.
         e.   To the extent that there is an inconsistency or discrepancy
between a requirement and/or provision of subsection 10-7-7F of this title and
this chapter, the stricter requirement/provision shall apply.
   G.   Corrective Work: Nothing in this section shall prohibit the individual
or body designated to grant approval from authorizing grading deemed necessary
to correct previously disturbed natural areas or existing hazardous conditions
that are on site but not a part of the proposed development area and that are
brought to the city's attention. In such case, the applicant will investigate
possible alternatives with subsequent review by the individual or body
designated to grant approval. (Ord. 2013-03, 4-3-2013)

SECTION:
10-8-1: Repairs And Alterations
10-8-2: Insufficient Parking
10-8-3: One Year Vacancy
10-8-4: Occupancy Within One Year
10-8-5: Change Of Use
10-8-6: Recreational Vehicles Occupied For More Than Thirty Days
10-8-1: REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS:
   A.   Maintenance repairs are allowed on noncomplying buildings or
structures, or to a building or structure housing a nonconforming use, so long
as such repairs do not enlarge nor extend such nonconforming use.
   B.   Buildings or structures on commercial or residential lots, which have
become noncomplying or whose uses have become nonconforming because of LaVerkin
City action, i.e., rezoning or ordinance changes, may be torn down and
reconstructed if: 1) they are involuntarily destroyed in whole or in part due
to fire or other calamity, and their use has not been abandoned, or 2) all
other zoning, beautification, and building requirements are met. In such cases
where current zoning requirements would create an unreasonable hardship, the
city council may approve reconstruction maintaining the existing noncomplying
or nonconforming conditions. Requests for such reconstruction may be made in
conjunction with conditional use requests through planning commission and city
council. (Ord. 2011-05, 4-20-2011)
10-8-2: INSUFFICIENT PARKING:
A building or structure that is nonconforming because of a lack of sufficient
automobile parking space in connection therewith, as required by this title,
may be altered or enlarged only after additional automobile parking space is
supplied to bring the building or structure and addition into compliance. (Ord.
2004-28, 10-20-2004; amd. Ord. 2005-33, 9-21-2005)
10-8-3: ONE YEAR VACANCY:
A building or structure or portion thereof occupied by a nonconforming use
which is or hereinafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied by a
nonconforming use for a continuous period of one year, shall not thereafter be
occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district
in which it is located. (Ord. 2004-28, 10-20-2004; amd. Ord. 2005-33, 9-21-
2005)
10-8-4: OCCUPANCY WITHIN ONE YEAR:
A vacant building or structure may be occupied by a use for which the building
or structure was designed if occupied within a period of one year after the use
became nonconforming. (Ord. 2004-28, 10-20-2004; amd. Ord. 2005-33, 9-21-2005)
10-8-5: CHANGE OF USE:
The nonconforming use of a building or structure may not be changed, except to
a conforming use. The use shall not thereafter be changed back to a
nonconforming use. (Ord. 2004-28, 10-20-2004; amd. Ord. 2005-33, 9-21-2005)
10-8-6: RECREATIONAL VEHICLES OCCUPIED FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS:
The provisions of sections
10-8-3 and
10-8-4 of this chapter shall not apply to recreational vehicles. In the case of
recreational vehicles occupied consecutively for more than thirty (30) days
prior to the passage date hereof, the continued, uninterrupted occupancy of
said vehicles shall be considered a nonconforming use. However, if such a
recreational vehicle becomes unoccupied and remains dormant for a period of
twenty one (21) consecutive days, or if it is removed at all from the lot where
it has rested to any other locations, even if later returned to the same lot,
the nonconforming status of the recreational vehicle shall be considered
terminated, and the city may enforce the provisions of this section. A lot or
parcel of property on which a nonconforming recreational vehicle has rested
shall not itself be considered nonconforming, and once the recreational vehicle
is removed or loses its nonconforming status, use of the lot or portion must
thereafter be consistent with all provisions of this zoning ordinance, and
consequently, later use of the lot or portion for temporary recreational
vehicles may only be for thirty (30) days or less. (Ord. 2004-28, 10-20-2004;
amd. Ord. 2005-33, 9-21-2005)

10-9-11: Appeal Of Decision
10-9-1: PURPOSES:
The purpose of a conditional use permit is to allow proper integration of uses
into the community which may only be suitable in specific locations, may be
consistent with the purpose of a zone district only under certain
circumstances, and/or may have potentially detrimental effects to surrounding
properties if not properly designed, located and conditioned. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-
19-2004)
10-9-2: PERMIT REQUIRED:
A conditional use permit shall be required for all uses listed as conditional
uses in the district regulations or elsewhere in this title. No building permit
or other permit or license shall be issued for a use requiring conditional use
without first being reviewed and/or approved by the planning commission and the
city council. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-19-2004)
10-9-3: CLASSIFICATION:
Conditional use permits shall fall into three (3) classifications:
   A.   Class A: No inspection required. No notification required.
   B.   Class B: May require one inspection. May require notification.
   C.   Class C: Will require inspections and notification. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-
19-2004)

Application for conditional use permit shall be made by the property owner,
developer or certified agent on a form authorized by the city. Application
shall be filed with the planning commission with proper fee, maps, drawings,
statements, other documents as required and the following information:
   A.   Name and address of applicant;
   B.   Title report showing that applicant is the owner or the certified agent
for property on which proposed use will be located, except for proposed utility
right of way;
   C.   Address and legal description of the property;
   D.   Statement indicating the nature of the proposed use with any other data
pertinent to the granting of a use permit;

available to applicant prior to the public meeting. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-19-2004)
10-9-6: PUBLIC HEARING:
No public hearing shall be required; however, a hearing may be held when the
planning commission or city council shall determine that a hearing would serve
the public interest. During the public meeting where the conditional use is
heard, the planning commission may recommend to grant, grant with conditions,
or deny the conditional use to the city council. Such recommendation shall not
be heard by city council less than fourteen (14) days following the planning
commission public meeting. Upon such hearing by the city council, that body may
grant, grant with conditions or deny the conditional use request. Recommended
conditions by planning commission shall be considered part of the conditional
use unless specifically changed by the conditions stated by the city council. A
conditional use permit may also be made revocable, may be granted for a limited
time period based on factors calling for a temporary permit, or may be granted
subject to such conditions as the city council may prescribe. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-
19-2004)
10-9-7: DETERMINATION:
A conditional use may be located within any district in which the particular
conditional use is permitted by the use regulations of this title. In
authorizing any conditional use, the city council shall impose such
requirements and conditions as are necessary for the protection of adjacent
properties and the public welfare. The city council shall not authorize a
conditional use permit, unless the evidence presented is such as to establish:
   A.   That the proposed use of the particular location is necessary or
desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general
well being of the community and the neighborhood; and
   B.   That such use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case,
be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or
working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or improvements in the
vicinity; and
   C.   The purposed use will comply with regulations and conditions specified
in this title for such use.
Conditions imposed by the city council may include, but are not limited to:

      19.   A variance from board of adjustment if applicable;
      20.   Such other conditions as the council may deem necessary to ensure
compatibility of the use with surrounding developments and uses and to preserve
the public health safety and welfare. The city council may require that the
applicant prepare and record covenants running with the land which under the
conditions are binding upon the applicants and their successors. (Ord. 2004-12,
5-19-2004)
10-9-8: INSPECTION:
Following the issuance of a conditional use permit, the building inspector
shall approve an application for a building permit and shall ensure that
development is undertaken and completed in compliance with said conditional use
and building permit. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-19-2004)
10-9-9: EXPIRATION:
Unless otherwise specified in the action granting a conditional use permit, a
permit which has not been utilized within twelve (12) months from its effective
date shall become null and void. Once any portion of the conditional use permit
is utilized, the other portions and conditions related thereto become
immediately operative and must be strictly observed. Utilization shall be
construed to mean pouring of concrete, or commencement of framing on
construction, or commencement of the use or uses for which the permit was
granted, and reasonable progress thereafter toward full completion of the
contemplated project.
A conditional use permit for a temporary use may be issued for a maximum period
of six (6) months. The building official may grant an extension of six (6)
months when deemed in the public interest with renewals at his discretion, for
not more than three (3) successive periods thereafter. The permit shall be
nontransferable. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-19-2004)
10-9-10: MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION:
The city council may modify or revoke a conditional use permit, following
notice and a hearing. A conditional use permit may be modified or revoked if
the city council finds one or more of the following:
   A.   The permit was obtained by misrepresentation or fraud,
   B.   The specific use for which the permit was granted is not being
exercised; or
   C.   Noncompliance with conditions imposed upon said use permit. (Ord. 2004-
12, 5-19-2004)
10-9-11: APPEAL OF DECISION:
Any person shall have the right to appeal the decision to grant, grant with
conditions or deny a conditional use permit. Such appeal shall be made to the
board of adjustment.
Any person or entity desiring a special exception may apply to the board of
adjustment in the terms of this title as applied to zoning districts; providing
a landowner relief in extraordinary cases where the board of adjustment finds
the existing special fact and circumstances specified therein as sufficient to
warrant a diversion from the general rule. Special exceptions are not to be
granted liberally. (Ord. 2004-12, 5-19-2004)

Any work in progress on such sign shall be ordered by the planning commission
or designee to cease immediately and said sign shall be removed in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
      2.   Signs which are not in compliance with this chapter and are
therefore considered unlawful according to this section and which continue to

this section.
   E.   Removal Of Signs: The planning commission or designee shall cause to be
removed any sign not in compliance with safety or maintenance standards,
abandoned signs, dangerous or defective signs, or unlawful signs. The planning
commission or designee shall prepare a notice which shall describe the sign and
specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not
removed or the violation is not corrected within fifteen (15) days, the sign
shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      1.   Notices: All notices shall be mailed by certified mail to the owner
of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign and the

notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and shall
be posted on said sign or on the premises.
      2.   Time Periods: Any time periods provided in this section shall be
deemed to commence on the date of the certified mailing. If more than one

10-11-10: DISPOSAL OF SIGNS:
   A.   Authority: Any sign removed by abatement by the planning commission or
designee pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall become the property
of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the
city. The cost of removal and disposal shall be considered a debt owed to the
city by the owner of the sign and the owner of the property, and may be
recovered in an appropriate court action by the city. The cost of removal and
disposal shall include all incidental expenses incurred by the city in
connection with the sign removal and disposal.
   B.   Emergency Removal: When it is determined by the planning commission or
designee that said sign would cause an imminent danger to the public safety,
and contact cannot be made with the sign owner or property owner, no written
notice shall have to be served. In this emergency, the planning commission or
designee may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and
property owner.
   C.   Sale Of Signs: If it shall be necessary for the planning commission or
designee to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions hereof, and it should be
practical to sell or salvage any material derived in the aforesaid removal, the
planning commission may sell the same at private or public sale at the best
price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such
proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to
the sign owner or property owner. The city may file suit in court to collect
any excess over such proceeds and the cost of such removal shall be levied as
an assessment against the property on which the sign is located. (Ord. 2005-41,
12-21-2005)
10-11-11: AREA AND HEIGHT COMPUTATION:
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   A.   Single Faced Signs: The area of a sign face shall be computed by means
of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that
will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or
other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of
the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any
supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or
wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to
the display itself.
   B.   Multifaced Signs: The sign area for a sign with more than one face
shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from
any one point. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back so
that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such
sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than twenty
four inches (24") apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of
one of the faces.
   C.   Height: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
      1.   Existing grade prior to construction; or
      2.   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for locating the sign.
In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height
shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at
the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the
crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to
the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
   D.   Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area For Zone Lot: The permitted sum of
the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed by applying
the formulas provided in this chapter to the lot frontage, building frontage,
or wall area, as appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot is
located. Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets are allowed the permitted
sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is
oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's
total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area
frontage on that street. (Ord. 2005-41, 12-21-2005)

10-11-13: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of any zone lot or other
premises on which exists a sign that does not conform with the requirements of
this chapter or for which there is no current and valid sign permit shall be
obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of a nonconforming sign, to bring
into conformity with the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Signs Existing On Effective Date: For any sign existing in the city on
the effective date hereof, an application for a sign permit must be submitted
to the building inspector before the expiration of six (6) months from the
effective date hereof. For any sign on property annexed later, applications for
sign permits shall be submitted within six (6) months of the effective date of
the annexation or within such period as may be established in an annexation
agreement between the city and the landowner. Signs that are the subject of
applications received after the applicable date set forth in this section shall
be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this chapter and shall not be
entitled to the protection of this chapter.
   B.   Nonconforming Existing Signs; Permits And Terms:
      1.   Permit Issued: A sign that would be permitted under this chapter
only with a sign permit, but which was in existence on the effective date
hereof or a later date when the property is annexed to the city, and which was
constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in
effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size,
height, location, design or construction is not in conformance with the
requirements of this chapter, shall be issued a nonconforming sign permit if an
application in accordance with subsection A of this section is filed within six
(6) months of the above date or within six (6) months of property annexation.
      2.   Term: Such permit shall allow the signs subject to such permit,
which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this chapter, to remain in
place and be maintained for a period ending no later than five (5) years;
provided, that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the
nonconformity. Such signs are also subject to the provisions of subsection B4
of this section. A change in the information on the face of an existing
nonconforming sign is allowed; however, any nonconforming sign shall either be
eliminated or made to conform with the requirements of this section when any
proposed change, repair or maintenance would constitute an expense of more than
twenty five percent (25%) of the lesser of the original value or replacement
value of the sign.
      3.   Lapse Of Nonconforming Sign Permit: A nonconforming sign permit
shall lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those under which
any other sign permit may lapse and become void.

design; lighting; noise; dust; odors and emissions; colors; aesthetics; and
impacts on neighboring properties. Other conditions may be reviewed as the
council may deem necessary to ensure compatibility of the use with surrounding
developments and uses and to preserve the public health, safety and welfare.
The city council may require that the applicant prepare and record covenants,
conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) which are binding upon the applicants and
their successors. (Ord. 2007-16, 4-4-2007)

as required by this title.
   B.   Development Agreement:
      1.   Approval of any subdivision with lots less than fourteen thousand
(14,000) square feet shall be contingent upon the developer entering into a
development agreement in form and content as approved by the city council. Such
agreement shall constitute a binding contract between the developer and the
city (the parties) and shall be construed together with the provisions of this
chapter and any conditions attached thereto, to accomplish and give effect to
the purposes set forth herein. The city council, by and through the mayor,
shall be authorized to sign the development agreement(s) on behalf of the city.
      2.   The purpose of the development agreement shall be to specify the
detailed terms and conditions upon which the developer will complete the
subdivision and the covenants, conditions and restrictions that will attach to
the subdivision. The development agreement shall create a vested right in
applicant or its successors or assigns to develop and construct the project as
set forth in the development agreement. Any development agreement may be
amended by mutual written consent of the parties.
         a.   A development agreement, including exhibits incorporated by
reference thereto, entered into pursuant to this chapter shall contain

with lots less than fourteen thousand (14,000) square feet as would otherwise
be required by this title. To this end, all requirements, where possible, are
expressly delineated in this section or other applicable ordinances. However,
since it is impossible to cover every contingency and there are some aspects
which do not lend themselves to be easily articulated, this section allows the
planning commission to recommend and city council to impose reasonable
conditions upon an applicant in addition to those expressly required, so long
as such conditions do not conflict with any requirements set forth in this
section or other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 2007-16, 4-4-2007)

slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) but less than or equal to forty
percent (40%): In addition to the specific development regulations set forth in
section
10-15E-2 of this article, the following regulations apply:
         a.   Open Space: Seventy five percent (75%) of the steep slope area
must remain as open space.
         b.   Developable Land: Twenty five percent (25%) of the steep slope
area may be developed in accordance with the underlying zoning subject to the
following conditions:
            (1)   Maximum Density: The maximum density on developable land
within a steep slope area is governed by the underlying zoning and proof that
the proposed density will not have a significant adverse visual or
environmental effect on the community.
            (2)   Location Of Developable Land: The developable land in a steep
slope area is that area with the least visual and environmental impacts. The
applicant must provide a visual and environmental analysis considering the
visual impact from key vantage points, potential for screening location of
natural drainage channels, erosion potential, vegetation protection, access,
and similar site design criteria. Based upon such analysis, the planning
commission may require the applicant to site the developable land pursuant to
one or more of the following techniques:
               (A)   Clustered development (single units situated in close
proximity to other units with open space concentrated in 1 or more large areas
within the development), or
               (B)   Dispersed development (single units separated by larger
areas of open space), or
               (C)   Transfer of density to the least sensitive portions of the
site.
            (3)   Density Transfer: Upon proof of a sensitive site plan, the
applicant may transfer up to twenty five percent (25%) of the densities from
the open space portion of the site to the developable land.
            (4)   Suitability Determination: The applicant must prove that the
development will have no significant adverse impact on adjacent properties. The
planning commission shall determine that the proposal complies with this
chapter if the applicant proves:
               (A)   The density is compatible with that of adjacent
properties.
               (B)   The architectural detail, height, building materials, and
other design features of the development are compatible with adjacent
properties.

         b.   Location: All wetlands that are adjacent to, or contiguous with,
a stream corridor.
      2.   Stream Corridor: All stream corridors are significant. Stream
corridors are not irrigation ditches.
   F.   Setbacks: The following setbacks are required:
      1.   Setbacks from wetlands shall extend a minimum of fifty feet (50')
outward from the delineated wetland edge.
      2.   Setbacks from stream corridors shall extend a minimum of fifty feet
(50') outward from the ordinary high water mark.
      3.   Setbacks from irrigation ditches shall extend a minimum of twenty
feet (20') from the ordinary high water mark.
   G.   Runoff Control: All projects and development must apply best management
practices for both temporary and permanent runoff control, including all storm
drain, to minimize sediment and other contaminants.
   H.   Planned Community Development (PCD) Open Space Requirements: The
planning commission may reduce the sixty percent (60%) PCD open space
requirement in the developable land if the planning commission determines that:
      1.   Open space set aside is sufficient to provide adequate natural open
space for the entire development; and

residents of the development; and
      3.   At least twenty percent (20%) of the developable land is open space.
(Ord. 2003-07, 4-16-2003)
10-15E-6: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN GUIDELINES:
   A.   Number Of Exterior Wall Materials: Different exterior siding materials
add interest to a building, and to the community as a whole; however, the use
of too many exterior materials, like excessive ornamentation, detracts from the
values of adjoining properties. Exterior walls of any building may be sided
with up to three (3) different materials per building, but no more than three
(3) materials may appear on any one wall, including ornamental siding. Trim
shall not be counted as a siding material, but ornamentation is counted as a
siding material. If trim covers more than ten percent (10%) of a side of the
building, it shall be counted as a siding material on that side.
   B.   Roofing Materials: Because of the steep grade changes within the
planned community development zoning district, and the fact that residents and
visitors are frequently in a position to look down on the city from the
adjoining mesas, the appearance of roofs in LaVerkin is of more significance
than in other communities. For this reason, the following roof types are
prohibited in the planned community development zoning district:
      1.   Untreated aluminum or metal, except that copper may be used;
      2.   Reflective materials;
      3.   Brightly colored roofing such as bright red, blue, yellow, green or
similar colors that are highly visible. Exception: Green is allowed if it is
determined that its hue, color, chrome and other attributes of color are
similar to other earth tone colors. In no case shall the color be determined to
be bright or highly reflective or towards the yellow tones of the color
spectrum; or
      4.   Mechanical equipment on roofs must be hidden with a visual barrier
so it is not readily visible from nearby properties.
   C.   Skylights And Solar Panels: Skylights and solar panels must be designed
to fit flush with the roof surface, or up to a maximum of two feet (2') above
the roof's surface. No reflective material may be used unless thoroughly
shielded to prevent reflection into adjoining or nearby properties.
   D.   Window Treatments: Untreated aluminum or metal window frames are
prohibited.
   E.   Lighting: With the exception of applicable state and federal law
governing lighting requirements and street lighting, the following design
standards shall apply when exterior lighting is proposed and/or required in the
planned community development zoning district. The city of LaVerkin's light
ordinance is incorporated herein by reference, and to the extent the lighting
requirements in the planned community development zoning district are more
restrictive than the city's general light ordinance, the provisions herein
shall apply and supersede those in the general light ordinance. To the extent
an aspect of the general light ordinance is not covered herein, the provisions
of the general light ordinance shall apply.
      1.   Shielding: Exterior lighting shall be shielded and directed downward
so that the light source, the actual bulb, is not visible from beyond the
property line on which the structure is located. Exterior lighting shall not
project above the horizontal plane of the building.
      2.   Color: Warm lighting colors are required. The blue-white colors of
fluorescent and mercury vapor lamps are prohibited. Lamps emitting a color
temperature in excess of five thousand degrees (5,000°) Kelvin are prohibited.
      3.   Parking Area Lighting: In parking lots, a minimum foot-candle of 1.0
at the perimeter and between light sources, and a maximum of 5.0 foot-candles
under light fixtures are required. The height of light fixtures shall be in
proportion to the building mass and no more than fourteen feet (14') high. When
all businesses are closed, only a minimum of security lighting shall be
maintained. Shielded spotlights may be used when highlighting trees, artwork or
other special landscape features.
      4.   Advertising: The operation of searchlights or similar sources for
advertising, display or any other commercial purpose is prohibited.
   F.   Trash Enclosures: In addition to applicable local, state, and federal
health standards, if any, the following trash enclosure design standards shall
apply:
      1.   Trash and storage areas shall be screened by landscaping, fencing,
berms or other devices integral to overall site and building design;
      2.   Trash and storage enclosures shall be constructed of materials that
are compatible with the proposed or existing building and with surrounding
structures;
      3.   Trash and storage areas shall be well maintained including prompt
repair and replacement of damaged gates, fences and plants;
      4.   Openings of trash enclosures shall be oriented away from public view
or screened with sturdy gates wide enough to allow easy access for trash
collection, where practical; and
      5.   The consolidation of trash areas between businesses and the use of
modem disposal techniques is encouraged.
   G.   Mechanical Equipment: All electrical service equipment and subpanels
and all mechanical equipment, including, but not limited to, air conditioning,
pool equipment, fans and vents, utility transformers, except those owned and
maintained by public utility companies, and solar panels, shall be painted to
match the surrounding wall color or painted or screened to blend with the
surrounding natural terrain. Roof mounted equipment and vents shall be painted
to match the roof and/or adjacent wall color and shall be screened or
integrated into the design of the structure. (Ord. 2003-07, 4-16-2003)
10-15E-7: PERMITTED DESIGN FEATURES:
Any design or material that is not expressly permitted by this chapter, or a
resolution adopted to supplement it, is prohibited. (Ord. 2003-07, 4-16-2003)

has been created pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this
Title.
   C.   All lots, plots or tracts of land located within a subdivision shall be
subject to this chapter regardless of whether such tract is owned by the
subdivider or a subsequent purchaser, transferor or holder of the land.
   D.   No subdivision plan or plat shall have the effect of creating a
derelict lot or parcel. Any such lot or parcel must be attached to adjacent
lots or parcels rather than allowed to remain as an independent lot or parcel.

of more than four (4) units, planned development communities, and applications
affecting property within identified geological hazard areas, shall be reviewed
and approved by the planning commission and city council in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.

section is void.
   I.   A transfer of land pursuant to a void plat is voidable by the land use
authority.

been recorded and all public improvements have been installed and accepted by
the city or guaranteed with an improvement completion assurance.
   K.   An owner of any land located in a subdivision who transfers or sells
any land in that subdivision before a plat of the subdivision has been approved

approval in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, except as follows:
   A.   A subdivision creating no more than one (1) new lot may, with written
approval from city staff, be approved without the necessity of preparing and
filing a preliminary plat or final plat if:
      1.   The proposed subdivision is not traversed by the mapped lines of a
proposed street as shown in the general plan unless the city staff has approved
the location and dedication of any public street, municipal utility easement,
any other easement, or any other land for public purposes as the municipality's
ordinance requires;
      2.   The proposed subdivision has been approved by the culinary water
authority and the sanitary sewer authority;

      4.   The proposed subdivision conforms to all applicable land use
ordinances or has properly received a variance from the requirements of an
otherwise conflicting and applicable land use ordinance.
   B.   A lot or parcel resulting from a division of agricultural land is
exempt from the plat requirements of this chapter if the lot or parcel:
      1.   Qualifies as land in agricultural use under Utah Code Ann. § 59-2-
502;
      2.   Meets the minimum size requirement of the applicable land use
ordinances; and
      3.   Is not and will not be used for any non-agricultural purpose.

above shall be graphically illustrated on a record of survey map that, after
receiving the same approvals as are required for a plat under § 10-9a-604 of
the Utah Code, as amended, shall be recorded with the Washington County

   D.   If a lot or parcel exempted under subsection B above is used for a non-
agricultural purpose, the city may require the lot or parcel to comply with the
requirements of Utah Code Ann. § 10-9a-603, as amended, and the subdivision
requirements of this chapter.
   E.   Documents recorded in the Washington County Recorder's Office that
divide property by a metes and bounds description do not create an approved
subdivision allowed by this chapter unless the written approval required by
subsection A above is attached to the document.
   F.   The creation of a lot under subsection A above shall not be approved
until a plan for providing utilities and other required improvements to the
proposed lot has been reviewed and signed by members of the Joint Utility
Committee. No building permit will be issued for said lot until the approved
improvements are constructed and accepted.
   G.   Lot line adjustments are exempt from plat requirements. However, in
instances where the property to be adjusted abuts a city street where
improvements have only been extended to the pre-adjustment property line, prior
to final approval of the lot line adjustment, street improvements congruent to
those that are existing shall be required.

TITLE 12
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
12-1-1: Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And Methods
12-1-2: Definitions
12-1-3: General Provisions
12-1-4: Penalties For Noncompliance
12-1-1: AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Utah has, in
the provisions to Utah Code Annotated (1953, as amended), delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the city of LaVerkin,
Utah ("the city"), does ordain and establish as herein set forth.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief; all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are created: a) by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities; and b) by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands, because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this title to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas, by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified of property that is
situated in a flood area.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this title encourages, promotes, and uses the following methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage;
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)
12-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give
this title the most reasonable application:
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform, which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building:
   A.   Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B,
C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of
the water; and
   B.   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case
of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building",
even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the
breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the national flood
insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, means structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of
the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date.
"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulation adopted by LaVerkin City.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage
to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
1. By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior;
or
2. Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (pub. l. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either:
   A.   The first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
   B.   The placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications,
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this title when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this title. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the national flood insurance program
regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)
12-1-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Title Applies: This title shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study For
LaVerkin City", dated (and to be effective) April 2, 2009, with accompanying
flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and
any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this title.
   C.   Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this title.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land, to which the provisions of this title
apply, shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, altered,
or have its use changed, without full compliance with the provisions of this
title and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This title is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this title and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this title,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body of the city; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this title is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater
floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This title does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This title shall not create liability on the part of
the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this title or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)
12-1-4: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
Violation of the provisions of this title by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a class B misdemeanor. Any person
who violates this title or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than the current fine, or imprisoned
for not more than the current penalty allows, or both, for each violation, and,
in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the prosecution and
enforcement of the matter. Nothing herein contained shall prevent LaVerkin City
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
violation. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)

12-2-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   The appeal authority as established by the city shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this title.
   B.   The appeal authority shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this title.
   C.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal authority
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request.
   E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this title.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 12-2-3B of
this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
title, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this title
(i.e., subsection 12-1-1C of this title).
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that: 1) the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure, and 2) the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      1.   The criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are
met, and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)
12-2-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      7.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in: 1) subsection 12-1-3B
of this title, 2) subsection 12-2-2I of this chapter, or 3) subsection C3 of
this section, the following provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is
satisfied.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed within zone
A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices
which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   C.   Standards For Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the provisions of this
title.
      2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of this title.
      3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots
or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to
subsection 12-1-3B of this title or subsection 12-2-2I of this chapter.
      4.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      5.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-18-2009)
CHAPTER 3
SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS
SECTION:
12-3-1: General Requirements
12-3-2: Design Criteria
12-3-3: Excavation; Floor Level
12-3-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Grading Permit: All new developments, which require a grading permit,
or exceed one acre in area, shall submit a drainage control plan and report
prepared by a Utah registered professional engineer.
   B.   Building Requirements: Building floor levels shall be constructed a
minimum of two feet above the 100-year FEMA, and non-FEMA flood level, unless
otherwise approved by LaVerkin City as outlined in this title. Encroachment
within the 100-year floodplain for FEMA and non-FEMA natural watercourses will
not be permitted without HEC-2 hydraulic studies as directed by LaVerkin City.
All natural drainages, washes, and waterways that convey a developed 100-year
flow of one hundred (100) cfs or more shall be left open and undisturbed,
unless otherwise approved by LaVerkin City. Any alteration of FEMA floodways is
not permitted unless the proposed use can be shown to have no negative
influence on flood conveyance.
   C.   Drainage Design: Because of potential negative impacts, design of
drainage systems associated with new development cannot cause increases in
existing flood peak discharges downstream for 10-year and 100-year floods.
Drainage facilities shall be designed using currently accepted civil
engineering standards of care, applicable safety standards, and public agency
or other approved design specifications and shall be approved by the city
engineer.
   D.   Capacity: The official level of flood protection is the 100-year
recurrence interval for future land use conditions as defined by the flood
control plan. Drainage collection system capacities shall be sized for a
minimum of the 10-year flood, but no significant damage or risk of personal
injury may occur in a 100-year flood. Major hydraulic structures (including
bridges and open channels) shall be designed for the 100-year flood. (Ord.
2005-21, 5-4-2005)
12-3-2: DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   Streets: Design criteria for gutter capacity and associated lane
flooding will depend on roadway type as shown in table below. Street designs
must include surface drainage relief points (especially for flat gradient
areas, local sumps or depressions and downhill cul-de-sacs) and provide for
routing of 100-year recurrence hydrographs to adequate downstream conveyance
facilities. For pedestrian safety, 100-year flood flow in streets must be
limited by underground storm drain conveyance and street design so that the
product of depth (feet) and velocity (feet/second) in gutter does not exceed
six (6). 100-year flood flows in streets must be contained within the street
right of way and adjacent drainage easements. Where underground conveyance is
required to limit street flows, it will be designed for the 10-year flood, or
greater.
   STREET GUTTER CAPACITY FOR 100-YEAR EVENT
 
Locals                          Flow may spread to crown
Minor collector and residential Flow may spread to crown
collector
Collector and major collector   Flow spread must leave 1 travel lane free
                                of water
                                Flow spread must leave 1 travel lane and
Arterial                        center turn lane in each direction free
                                of water
 
   B.   Storm Drains:
      1.   Storm drain design conveyance capacity will be sized for a minimum
of the 10-year, 3-hour flood. The 100-year, 3-hour design flood will be used
for evaluation and prevention of significant damage due to street overflow.
Inlets must have sufficient capacity to prevent local ponding in the 10-year
event, with fifty percent (50%) blocking of inlets by debris. Analysis of
combined street and storm drain capacity for the 100-year flood must determine
maximum ponding depths and water levels and show that these are nondamaging.
      2.   Design consideration will be given for differences in interception
capacity of inlets on grade compared to interception capacity of inlets in sag
locations. Inlet spacing and locations will be for continuous grade or sag
situations, as appropriate.
      3.   All storm drains will be designed by application of the Manning
equation. Minimum velocity shall be two (2) feet/second flowing one-half (1/2)
full.
      4.   Storm drains will not be allowed to be designed for surcharged pipe
conditions unless otherwise approved by LaVerkin City. When storm drains are
designed for full pipe flow, or surcharged pipe conditions, the designer shall
establish the hydraulic grade line considering head losses caused by flow
resistance in the pipe, and changes of momentum and interference at junctions,
bends, and structures. The water surface elevation profile and hydraulic grade
line will be shown for the 10-year and 100-year design flood as required in the
drainage control report and plan.
   C.   Culverts: A culvert entrance blockage factor of up to fifty percent
(50%) shall be used for small diameter culverts and culverts placed in
drainages with upstream debris as determined by LaVerkin City. The 100-year
water surface backwater upstream will be determined (using HEC-2) and shown to
be nondamaging. Potential paths of embankment overtopping flows will be
determined and redirected, if necessary, so that no significant flood damage
occurs.
   D.   Bridges: Bridges must pass the 100-year event with a minimum of one
foot (1') of freeboard. No significant increases are allowed in upstream water
levels. A HEC-2 analysis of potential upstream water surface increases may be
required by LaVerkin City. If the bridge deck is not free span, local and
regional scour analyses are required for pier footings and embankments.
Appropriate references are "Stream Stability At Highway Structures", "Hydraulic
Engineering Circular No. 20", federal highway administrations, and computer
programs such as USCOE HEC-6 or FHWA FESWMS.
   E.   Open Channels: The 100-year recurrence flood will be used for design.
Side slopes and maximum velocities will depend on criteria shown in the chart
below. Drop structures may be required to limit velocities to noneroding
values. Supercritical velocities are not permitted for any material. Any use of
irrigation ditches, or canals, for flood control must receive written approval
from both the irrigation company and LaVerkin City.

   Notes:
      1.   For composite lined channels, use the lowest of the maximum mean
velocities for the materials used in the composite lining.
      2.   Deviations from the above values are only allowed with appropriate
engineering analysis and/or suitable agreements for maintenance
responsibilities.

    Natural: Fortier and Scobey, 1926
    Fully lined: Various sources
Maximum velocities for grass lined channels depend on type of grass mixtures,
with higher velocities appropriate for Bermuda grass. Consult "Open-Channel
Hydraulics", Ven Te Chow, for details. The minimum bottom width of the channels
will be six feet (6') to facilitate access of maintenance equipment.
   F.   Storage Facilities: Storage facilities will generally be used to
prevent local increases in 10-year, 72-hour; and 100-year, 72-hour; peak flows
due to development or the 100-year, 3-hour storm, whichever case requires more
volume. Detention ponds must empty in twenty four (24) hours, or less.
Partially wet basins may be allowed for recreational or aesthetic purposes, but
storage below permanent spillways or low level outlets cannot be counted into
control calculations. Retention ponds intended for infiltration may require
extensive subsoil and ground water studies and maintenance requirements and are
not allowed unless approved by LaVerkin City.
Energy dissipation and erosion protection is required at all outlet structures
where storm drainage is released into a natural drainage course, unless
LaVerkin City agrees there is no need shown for such protection. (Ord. 2005-21,
5-4-2005)
12-3-3: EXCAVATION; FLOOR LEVEL:
No building shall be constructed in or moved to any floodplain, unless an
addition to the floodplain is created by excavating an area next to the
floodplain to an area, elevation, and volume no less than the space occupied by
the building. Each building in the floodplain shall have a floor level at least
two feet (2') above the 100-year FEMA, and non-FEMA flood level unless
otherwise approved by LaVerkin City as outlined in this title. All parts of any
such building below the floor level shall be waterproofed. No building shall be
constructed in a floodplain area without proof that the building's foundation
will not be affected by any water conditions in the area. (Ord. 2005-21, 5-4-
2005)
