chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “San Juan County
Code”, for which designation “code of ordinances”, “codified ordinances” or

resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section, unless otherwise provided.
§ 10.005 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or

construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons, unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural,
and words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the

not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid section
or application.
   (B)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code containing a
non-severability provision, each division or part of every section is
severable. If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:

so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
      (2)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in

entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,

or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.

forfeiture or liability incurred under the section, unless the repealing
section so expressly provides.
   (C)   The section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the
purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of

§ 11.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The Board of County Commissioners (Board) finds that the enforcement
of this code, the adopted rules and regulations and applicable state statutes
altogether referred to herein as “code”) is an essential public function. Code
enforcement is vital to the protection of the public’s health, safety and
quality of life. The Board therefore recognizes that enforcement starts with
the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in
administrative code enforcement hearings, judicial proceedings, land use
decisions, administrative processes affording a hearing and personnel
decisions. The Board finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that
uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain
compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative
code enforcement order may require the county to file a criminal or civil
action to gain compliance. For specified county action, or a decision made by a
county official, as more particularly defined and designated in published
county ordinances or policies, in which an adverse administrative decision by
the county results in detriment to a person, it is the purpose and intent of
the county to afford that person due process of law by way of an administrative
hearing. Due process shall require proper notice of the nature of the
administrative decision and the opportunity to be heard, a hearing before a
fair and impartial Administrative Law Judge, the right to present evidence, the
right to cross-examination, the right to be represented by an attorney or other
advocate, the right to receive an adequate explanation of the reasons
justifying any resulting administrative order.
   (B)   The Board of County Commissioners further finds that an effective
county administrative review process gives property owners, citizens,
businesses, and the county an opportunity for an independent review of
administrative decisions. An effective administrative review allows the appeal
authority to revisit and establish the relevant facts and information, and
ensure the proper legal standards are applied. An effective administrative
appeal process provides an opportunity for the parties to mediate settlement
alternatives, as appropriate. The county administrative review process
safeguards the rights of businesses, property owners, citizens, and
associations; identifies and addresses errors in administrative decisions; and
reduces the potential for county legal costs and financial liability associated
with protracted litigation.
(Ord. 2020-11, passed 9-2-2020; Ord. 2023-03, passed 5-16-2023)
§ 11.002 SCOPE.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter may be applied to all violations of
this code, the adopted rules and regulations and applicable state statutes. It
has been designed as an additional remedy for the county’s use in achieving
compliance with county ordinances and in achieving compliance with the rules
and regulations.
   (B)   The appeal remedies contained in this chapter apply to all county
administrative decisions or actions, whether such decisions or actions are
based on the county code, on adopted rules and regulations, or applicable state
statutes, unless the county code provision relevant to the administrative
decision or action provides for an alternative appeal remedy.
(Ord. 2020-11, passed 9-2-2020; Ord. 2023-03, passed 5-16-2023)
§ 11.003 EXISTING LAW CONTINUED.
   The provisions of this chapter do not invalidate any other provisions of
this code, other county ordinances, but shall be read in conjunction therewith
as an additional remedy. By establishing performance standards and obligations
to act, it is the intent of the Board that county employees and officers, as
well as employees and officers of county districts, exercise discretionary
authority in pursuit of an essential governmental function and that any such
standards or obligations shall not be construed as creating a ministerial duty
for purposes of tort liability.

officer, dereliction of assigned duties or the existence of a systemic bias or
conflict of interest that might affect impartiality of decisions.
      (4)   A person appointed to serve as an Administrative Law Judge shall
either be law trained or have significant experience with the requirements and
operation of administrative hearing processes. The person shall be free from
any systemic bias or conflict of interest that might affect impartiality of
decisions.
      (5)   An Administrative Law Judge, in individual administrative reviews,

Administrative Law Judge shall not adjudicate/review a matter if he or she is
biased or prejudicated with respect to any issue, person, or party; or has a
personal interest which impairs his or her ability to fairly address the facts
and law in a matter. A motion to disqualify under this rule may be submitted to
the Administrative Law Judge by any party to an administrative appeal. The
Administrative Law Judge shall consider the motion and shall decide whether to
proceed with the adjudication/review or withdraw. The Administrative Law Judge

         (b)   PREJUDICE means a fixed mental attitude or position of a judge,
based on extrajudicial factors (factors other than the law or evidence

or other interests or relationships that influence a judge’s judicial conduct
or judgment.

administrative review for violations of
Ch. 152 of this code of ordinances and such other matters as specifically
designated by published ordinance or policy.
      (2)   An Administrative Law Judge is a quasi-judicial officer, which
includes the authority to investigate and adjudicate the matter on appeal. In
all cases, the review of the matter on appeal shall be de novo. The
Administrative Law Judge may mediate a resolution of the matter among the
parties towards a settlement of the appeal.
      (3)   An Administrative Law Judge may continue a review for good cause
shown by one of the parties or if the Administrative Law Judge independently
determines that due process has not been adequately afforded to a party.
      (4)   At the request of any party to an administrative hearing, an
Administrative Law Judge may sign subpoenas for witnesses, documents and other
evidence where the attendance of the witness or the admission of evidence is
deemed helpful by the Administrative Law Judge to decide issues at the hearing.
All costs related to the subpoena, including witness and mileage fees, shall be
borne by the party requesting the subpoena.
      (5)   The Administrative Law Judge may modify civil fees or fines upon a
finding of good cause. The Administrative Law Judge may reduce the fines to
what is just and equitable under the circumstances; however, in connection with

Judge may not order the responsible person to pay less than actual costs
incurred by the county and shall require the responsible person to pay the
administrative costs as established in the consolidated fee schedule.

reverse, in whole or in part; remand; or modify the administrative decision of

abatement, assessing civil fines; or, where extraordinary circumstances exist,
granting a new review.
      (8)   An Administrative Law Judge may require a responsible person to
post a performance bond to ensure compliance with an administrative order, but
only if agreed to by the enforcement official handling the matter for the
county.
      (9)   An Administrative Law Judge shall not make any order that would
require or allow a person to violate state law or county ordinance.
      (10)   An Administrative Law Judge shall not adjudicate or review an
appeal of a legislative decision.

appropriate pre-hearing requirements.
   (B)   For any pre-hearing conference, except for a settlement conference,
the Administrative Law Judge shall publish a memorandum which summarizes the
issues discussed during the pre-hearing conference, and, if appropriate,
publish orders for the parties relating to the matter on appeal. At any time
after an appeal is filed, the Administrative Law Judge may order a party to
produce documents or other evidence under the party’s control if necessary to
decide the matter pending before the Administrative Law Judge. At any time, the
Administrative Law Judge may take judicial notice of public or generally
available facts or information, provided that all parties are informed of the
facts or information which the Administrative Law Judge intends to judicially
notice and each party shall be given a reasonable opportunity to refute the
facts or information which the Administrative Law Judge intends to judicially
notice.
   (C)   Prior to a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall include the
parties in the preparation and publication of a hearing management order. That
order may include, as appropriate: submission of documents and production of
witness lists prior to the hearing; the types of evidence to be considered;

closed to the public; recording of the hearing; representation of the parties;
sequencing of the presentation of evidence and making arguments; consequences
of a person or party failing to appear at the hearing; issuance of subpoenas,
as appropriate; parties’ opportunity to confront and cross examine witnesses;
the parties’ burdens of proof (including affirmative defenses); exclusion of

the Administrative Law Judge in questioning witnesses; submission of rebuttal
evidence; requests for continuance and how such requests will be handled; and
motions and how motions will be handled.
   (D)   Administrative hearings are intended to be informal in nature. The
state rules of civil procedure and evidence shall be guidelines for the conduct
of the hearing but shall not be binding. Formal rules of evidence and civil
procedure, including discovery shall not apply; however, upon request made in
writing reasonably in advance of a hearing, the county shall provide to a
person requesting a hearing the opportunity to review documents, photographs or
other tangible evidence it intends to present at the hearing and shall provide
a list of the witnesses it intends to call at the hearing. Failure to request
discovery shall not be a basis for a continuance. Complainant information shall
not be disclosed or released unless the complainant is a witness at the
hearing. The procedure and format of the administrative hearing shall follow
duly adopted policies and procedures.
   (E)   The county shall bear the initial burden of proof to establish the
existence of a violation of published county ordinances or policies other than
those in a land use appeal.
   (F)   In a land use appeal, the initial burden of proof shall be borne by
the appellant.
   (G)   After a party’s initial burden of proof has been met, the
Administrative Law Judge shall inform the parties of each party’s burdens of
proof; based on the matter on appeal, relevant state statutes, and relevant
state case law.
   (H)   Unless required otherwise by state statute or state case law, such
burden of proof shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence.
   (I)   Each party shall have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and
present evidence in support of the case. A written declaration signed under
penalty of perjury may be accepted in lieu of a personal appearance. Testimony
may be given by telephone or other electronic means.
   (J)   Administrative hearings shall be held at the county administrative
officesand shall be recorded; however, at the discretion of the Administrative
Law Judge, administrative hearings may be held at the location of a violation
as long as adequate provision is made to preserve a verbatim record of the
hearing.
   (K)   The person shall have the right to be represented by an attorney or
other advocate. If an attorney will be representing a responsible person at a
hearing, notice of the attorney’s name, address and telephone number shall be
given to the County Attorney at least one day prior to the hearing. If such
notice is not given, the hearing may be continued at the county’s request.
   (L)   Administrative hearings may be held on Mondays through Fridays,
excluding county holidays, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

and the right to appeal.
      (2)   Within ten business days after all evidence and testimony are
presented, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a written administrative
order that affirms or reverses, in whole or in part; remands; or modifies the

ability to take necessary corrective actions by specified deadlines. Such fees
shall continue to accrue until the responsible person complies with the
Administrative Law Judge’s decision and corrects the violation.
      (9)   An administrative order imposing civil fines for failure to abate a
violation of the county code by a stated deadline, shall continue to accrue

each day the violation remains uncorrected and not to exceed a total of $3,000
for a violation.

hearings as may be necessary or as requested by the county to ensure compliance

§ 11.011 COUNTY EMPLOYEE APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Employee appeals. Employee appeals for the county shall consist of the
county’s Administrative Law Judge appointed or designated pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this code.
   (B)   Non-appealable actions.
      (1)   No probationary, temporary/seasonal or part-time employee, or
appointed employee, has the right to appeal any disciplinary action or other
employment action.
      (2)   No employees have appeal rights for verbal warnings, written
reprimands or involuntary reassignment for disciplinary purposes which do not
affect the employee’s rate of pay.
      (3)   Unless specifically provided by this section, no employee has the
right to appeal a termination, transfer or pay reduction which is made for a
non-disciplinary reason, such as a reduction in force, furlough, reorganization
or a broadly applicable reduction in salary which affects multiple employees in
a department or in the county.
      (4)   No employees have appeal rights for suspension from employment
without pay for two days or less.
      (5)   No appeal is allowed from discharge or involuntary reassignment due
to loss of state or federal licensure or certifications which are required for

   (C)   Appealable rights for merit employees. Merit employees have the right
to appeal any disciplinary action resulting in:
      (1)   Dismissal, termination or release from employment;
      (2)   Demotion;
      (3)   Suspension from employment without pay for more than two days; or
      (4)   Involuntary transfer for a disciplinary purpose to a position with

   (D)   Merit employees have the right to appeal a dismissal, termination, or
release from employment, or reassignment to a position with less remuneration,

   (E)   Appealing to the Administrative Law Judge.
      (1)   Employees desiring to file an appeal must submit their written
notice of appeal, describing in detail the grounds for the appeal with any
supporting documentation, to the County Clerk or with the Chief Administrative
Officer within ten business days following the employment action giving rise to
the appeal, or an employee will be deemed to have waived all appeal rights.
      (2)   A copy of the appeal shall also be filed with the employee’s
supervisor and the Human Resource Department. Upon receipt of the employee’s
appeal, a date and time shall be set for the Administrative Law Judge to
convene a hearing to hear the appeal. All appeal documents will then be
forwarded to the Administrative Law Judge.
      (3)   Hearings and decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall be held
and rendered as soon as reasonably practicable, with no unreasonable delay. The
Administrative Law Judge may allow an enlargement of time for hearing
preparations, if good cause is shown.
      (4)   All parties to the appeal shall be entitled to appear at the appeal
hearing in person and to be represented by counsel, to have the hearing open to
the public, to confront witnesses whose testimony is to be considered and to
examine the evidence to be considered by the Administrative Law Judge.
      (5)   The Administrative Law Judge may request the appointment of
independent medical or other technical experts, in the Administrative Law
Judge’s sole discretion, if the Administrative Law Judge believes that the

      (7)   The Utah Rules of Evidence, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and Utah
Administrative Code do not apply to administrative hearings. Hearings are

The Administrative Law Judge may entertain objections in order to maintain
decorum and to address issues of relevance.
      (8)   In the Administrative Law Judge’s discretion, parties may convene
for a pre-hearing conference with the Administrative Law Judge to discuss
relevant issues, such as anticipated witnesses or the scope of the appeal.
   (F)   Record of the hearing. An audio recording of the hearing shall be kept
and all exhibits received in evidence at the hearing shall be maintained.
   (G)   Appeals from disciplinary actions. The proceedings for appeals from
disciplinary actions are bifurcated.
      (1)   During the first phase of the proceedings, the Administrative Law
Judge considers evidence of the charges upon which the discipline was based.
The county bears the burden of proving the charges by a preponderance of the
evidence.
         (a)   If the Administrative Law Judge sustains all of the charges,
then it shall proceed to the second phase of the hearing, described herein.
         (b)   If the Administrative Law Judge sustains none of the charges,
then the Administrative Law Judge shall overturn the disciplinary action.
         (c)   If the Administrative Law Judge sustains some, but not all, of
the charges, then the Administrative Law Judge shall refer the decision back to
the department director for reconsideration of the disciplinary decision, in
light of the Administrative Law Judge’s findings. A referral back to the
department director is an interlocutory order, and is not subject to appeal.
The department director may decrease the severity of, modify, withdraw or
retain the disciplinary decision previously made. If the department director
fails to respond to the Administrative Law Judge within three business days
from the Administrative Law Judge’s referral, then the Administrative Law Judge
shall proceed as if the department director has not changed the disciplinary
decision.
      (2)   During the second phase of the proceedings, the Administrative Law
Judge considers whether the misconduct warranted the sanction imposed by the
department director. The Administrative Law Judge gives broad deference to the
department director’s choice of punishment, and reviews that decision for an
abuse of discretion. The disciplined employee bears the burden of proving an
abuse of discretion by clear and convincing evidence:
         (a)   A department director abuses his or her discretion if the
sanction is arbitrary, capricious or illegal;
         (b)   When considering whether the sanction is arbitrary, capricious
or illegal, the Administrative Law Judge may consider whether the discipline
imposed is:
            1.   Disproportionate in light of the circumstances; or
            2.   Inconsistent with previous sanctions imposed by the department
upon similarly situated employees pursuant to the department’s or county’s own
policies.
         (c)   If the Administrative Law Judge finds that the disciplined
employee has carried the burden of establishing an abuse of discretion, then
the Administrative Law Judge shall overturn the disciplinary action.
      (3)   The disciplined employee may waive challenge to either phase of the
proceedings at any time. In the absence of a clear, written waiver, the
proceedings will proceed through both phases.
   (H)   Appeals from discharge or reassignment due to fitness for duty
determinations.
      (1)   In cases of discharge or transfer to a position of less
remuneration due to a determination that the individual is unfit to report to
duty due to a medical condition, the employee has the right to appeal that
decision.
      (2)   In cases of fitness for duty appeals, the county bears the burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances warrant
the action taken.
   (I)   Rendering decision.
      (1)   The Administrative Law Judge shall render a final decision in
writing and may:
         (a)   Sustain the county’s action; or
         (b)   Overturn the county’s action. If the county’s action is
overturned, the Human Resource Department or designee shall remove the record
of the overturned action from the employee’s personnel file and retain it
separately, which record shall be designated as private pursuant to state law.
      (2)   The Administrative Law Judge shall reinstate any loss of pay
associated with an overturned action, but in the case where an employee has
taken employment elsewhere, the amount shall be reduced by any amounts the
employee earned from other employment during this period of time.
      (3)   If a department director reduces the severity of the disciplinary
decision, then the Administrative Law Judge shall reinstate any loss of pay
which would not have been incurred, if the reduced discipline had been
initially imposed.
   (J)   Transmission. The Administrative Law Judge shall transmit a copy of
its decision to the employee, the department director, the Human Resource
Department and the County Recorder for certification. The County Clerk shall
certify the decision by placing the county’s official seal on the document and
the date of certification.

provided by or to the county.
   (F)   The scope of the appeal shall be the land use decision being appealed,
the grounds for relief raised by the appellant, issues the Administrative Law
Judge determines may be raised by a party in court after the final
administrative decision, and any requirements of county ordinances, policies,
and procedure.
   (G)   The review of factual matters by the Administrative Law Judge shall be
de novo. The Administrative Law Judge may request that the parties narrow the
factual matters or issues which are subject to de novo review.
   (H)   The Administrative Law Judge shall: presume that the land use decision
of a land use authority is valid; and uphold the land use decision unless the
land use decision is: (A) arbitrary and capricious; or (B) illegal.
      (1)   For purposes of appeal: A land use decision is arbitrary and
capricious if the land use decision is not supported by substantial evidence in
the record.
      (2)   A land use decision is illegal if the land use decision is:
         (a)   Based on an incorrect interpretation of the land use regulation;
or
         (b)   Contrary to law.
   (I)   If multiple land use decisions were made and timely appealed regarding
the same subject property and are subject to inseparable interests by nature of
the same project, property at issues, or the alleged injury to be caused, those
shall be consolidated into a single appeal before the Administrative Law Judge.
   (J)   The Administrative Law Judge may reverse the land use decision, affirm
the land use decision, affirm in part and/or reverse in part, modify a
condition or requirement, attach conditions or requirements, remand the land
use decision to the land use authority, and make any such order as ought to be
made consistent with its decision.
   (K)   On a question of law pertaining to the interpretation of CLUDMA, the
Administrative Law Judge may request an opinion from the County Attorney’s
Office prior to issuing any final decision on an appeal. The legal opinion will
be provided in writing to all parties and become part of the appeal record. The
legal opinion is not the final decision and is not binding on the
Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge must issue a written
final decision.
   (L)   The Administrative Law Judge may grant variances to county land use or

   (C)   Content. The notice of appeal shall clearly set forth:
      (1)   The appellant’s identity and contact information (including an
email address);
      (2)   The land use decision being appealed, including the date thereof
and, if applicable, the date the appellant discovered the decision;

clearly identify the message as a “notice of appeal.”
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 1-16-2024)
§ 12.006 APPEAL PROCESS.
   (A)   Intake. Upon receiving a notice of appeal, the Chief Administrative
Officer shall inspect it for compliance with the foregoing requirements of §
12.005. If the notice of appeal is compliant, it shall be transferred
immediately to the Appeal Authority and the County Attorney’s Office. If the
notice of appeal is not compliant, the Chief Administrative Officer shall
inform the appellant of the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are timely cured,
the notice of appeal shall be considered to have been filed when the initial
notice was filed.
   (B)   Notice to parties. Upon receiving the notice of appeal from the Chief
Administrative Officer, the Appeal Authority shall immediately determine
whether it is brought by the applicant. If not, the Appeal Authority shall
immediately inform the applicant of the appeal, invite the applicant to
participate as a party to the appeal, and the Appeal Authority and all other
parties shall treat the applicant as a party to the appeal.
   (C)   Record. Immediately upon receiving the notice of appeal, the County
Attorney shall assemble and serve on the Appeal Authority and the other parties
the record of the land use decision on appeal. The record shall include
relevant minutes, complete applications at issue, relevant communications with
the applicant, relevant communications with the appellant where applicable, and
any written record of the decision. The county shall Bates-stamp these
documents, which shall become the record on appeal. Absent extraordinary
circumstances, the County Attorney shall serve the record on the parties before
the scheduling conference is held.
   (D)   (1)   Scheduling conference. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the
Appeal Authority shall in timely fashion hold a scheduling conference to
include:
         (a)   Deciding whether the grounds for the land use decision appear in
the record provided by the County Attorney;
         (b)   Scheduling the hearing;
         (c)   Setting a submission date for briefing; and
         (d)   Confirming the theories of relief to be addressed on appeal.
      (2)   (Excluding jurisdictional issues, theories of relief and issues not
confirmed at the scheduling conference, including regarding the completeness
and adequacy of the record, will not be considered by the Appeal Authority. The
appellant must raise every theory of relief it can raise in district court.)
      (3)   Unless extraordinary circumstances prohibit it, the scheduling
conference shall be held within 14 days after the Appeal Authority receives the
notice of appeal. The scheduling conference need not be held in person but
shall include all parties.
   (E)   Briefing.
      (1)   Prior to the hearing, the parties (the appellant, the county, and,
if applicable, the applicant) shall file simultaneous briefs on the theories of
relief and issues confirmed at the scheduling conference. The briefs shall not
exceed 15 double-spaced pages, excluding the caption, signature block,
certificate of service, and exhibits. The briefs shall follow the formatting
required by Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 10(d) and be filed and served on the
Appeal Authority and all parties via email. Except as provided in division (H)
below, no affidavits or declarations or other evidentiary documents beyond
those contained in the record may be attached to the briefing.
      (2)   All theories of relief and issues, including jurisdiction, the
completeness of the record, or a party’s standing, shall be reserved for the
briefing and hearing, not presented through separate filings.
      (3)   No other briefing shall be filed or considered unless the Appeal
Authority orders supplemental briefing as described below. The date set for the
filing and service of briefs shall not be less than seven days before scheduled
hearing.
   (F)   Hearing.
      (1)   At the hearing, the parties shall present argument to the Appeal
Authority.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (H) below, the hearing need not be
held in person.
   (G)   Supplemental briefing. If at the end of the hearing the Appeal
Authority determines that supplemental briefing is necessary in order to render
an informed decision, the Appeal Authority may order supplemental briefing to
be filed on a specifically identified and narrow question. The Appeal Authority
shall set a date for the supplemental briefing to be filed, the briefing
length, and whatever else it deems appropriate. Unless extraordinary
circumstances require otherwise, the supplemental briefing shall be filed
within 14 days of the hearing. Supplemental briefing should be rare and
permitted only in extraordinary circumstances.
   (H)   Inadequate record. If at the scheduling conference the Appeal
Authority determines that the grounds for the land use decision do not appear
in the record provided by the County Attorney, then the foregoing process is
altered in the following ways:
      (1)   Each party may attach to its brief affidavits or declarations and
all documentary evidence related to the land use decision beyond the record
provided by the County Attorney that the party wishes the Appeal Authority to
consider. Absent good cause, documents not attached to a party’s brief will not
be considered. The Appeal Authority generally will follow the Utah Rules of
Evidence when considering the submitted affidavits or declarations and
documentary evidence.
      (2)   The parties may examine and cross-examine witnesses during the
hearing. Such testimony shall be guided generally by the Utah Rules of
Evidence.
      (3)   The hearing shall be held in person at the county’s administrative
offices.
      (4)   If at the end of the hearing the Appeal Authority determines that
supplemental evidence is necessary in order to render an informed decision, the
Appeal Authority may order specific supplemental evidence to be filed following
the procedure and direction of division (G).
(Ord. 2024-02, passed 1-16-2024)
§ 12.007 DECISION.
   (A)   Issuance. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Appeal Authority
shall serve on all parties a concise written decision within 28 days of the
hearing or of any ordered supplemental submissions, whichever is later. If the
Appeal Authority can do so, it is encouraged to issue its decision sooner.
   (B)   Standard of review. Except as provided in division (C), the Appeal
Authority shall review the land use decision and determine only whether it is
supported by substantial evidence or illegal. A land use decision is illegal if
it is based on an incorrect interpretation of a land use regulation, conflicts
with the authority granted by CLUDMA, or is contrary to law.
   (C)   Inadequate record. If at the scheduling conference the Appeal
Authority determines that the grounds for the land use decision do not appear
in the record provided by the County Attorney, then the Appeal Authority shall
determine whether the land use decision was correct.
   (D)   Content. The Appeal Authority’s written decision shall set forth
factual findings and legal conclusions sufficient for review. The Appeal
Authority may only affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the land use
decision. If reversed entirely or in any part, the Appeal Authority shall
provide the county instructions to issue a land use decision consistent with
the Appeal Authority’s decision.
   (E)   Notification. The Appeal Authority’s decision shall set forth in bold
typeface the parties’ rights to petition for judicial review, citing the
appropriate statute and providing a non-binding calculation of the filing
deadline.

§ 31.041 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the
CED Board and its members from approving grants that might benefit the private
interest of a Board member.
      (2)   This policy is intended to supplement, but not replace, any
applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to
governmental organizations.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      FINANCIAL INTEREST.
         (a)   A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or
indirectly, through business, investment or family:
            1.   An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which
the CED Board is considering an application, transaction or arrangement;
            2.   A compensation arrangement with the CED Board or with any
entity or individual with which the CED Board has a transaction or arrangement;
or
            3.   A potential ownership or investment interest in, or
compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the CED
Board is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
         (b)   Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well
as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.
         (c)   A FINANCIAL INTEREST is not necessarily a conflict of interest.
Under §
31.037(B) of this chapter, a person who has a financial interest may have a
conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee
decides that a conflict of interest exists.
      INTERESTED PERSON. Any Board member who has a direct or indirect
financial interest, as defined in division (C) below, is an INTERESTED PERSON.
   (C)   Procedures.
      (1)   Duty to disclose. In connection with any actual or possible
conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the
financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts
to the Board considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
      (2)   Determining whether a conflict of interest exists. After disclosure
of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with
the interested person, he or she shall leave the governing board or committee
meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and
voted upon. The remaining Board members shall decide if a conflict of interest
exists.
      (3)   Procedures for addressing the conflict of interest.
         (a)   An interested person may make a presentation at the governing
Board meeting, but after the presentation, he or she shall leave the meeting
during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement
involving the possible conflict of interest.
         (b)   After exercising due diligence, the governing Board shall
determine whether the organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more
advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not
give rise to a conflict of interest.
         (c)   If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not
reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest,
the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the
disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the CED
Board’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and
reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its
decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
      (4)   Violations of the conflicts of interest policy.
         (a)   If the governing Board has reasonable cause to believe a member
has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall
inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an
opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
         (b)   If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further
investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or
committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible
conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective
action.

      (1)   When a new or existing position becomes vacant, the employees in
the department where the vacancy occurs shall be notified. If more than one
employee expresses interest in the position, the applicable supervisor will
conduct interviews. If the applicable supervisor determines that there is an
interested, suitable candidate from within the department, the position may be
filled internally upon review and approval from the Human Resource Director and
the Board of County Commissioners.
      (2)   In some instances where a temporary employee is functioning in a
similar position as that being recruited for, the department head/elected
official will have the option of filling the vacancy without formal recruitment
or competition so long as the temporary employee qualifies for the position.
This qualification procedure will be met when:
         (a)   The employee has been in a temporary position for a period of at
least three months; and
         (b)   The employee has satisfactorily performed the duties for which
he or she has been assigned.
      (3)   Additionally, when the need has been determined and a request has
been approved by the Board of Commissioners, the department head may promote an
employee into a newly vacated position.
   (B)   County-wide recruitment. If internal department recruiting produces no
suitable candidates, recruitment may continue by posting the vacancy within all
the county departments. Any county employee may apply for a position by
contacting the Human Resource Department. After the position closes, the
applicable supervisor may interview qualified applicants. If the elected
official, department head or supervisor determines there is a suitable
candidate, the position may be filled upon review and approval from the Human
Resource Director and the Board of County Commissioners. The supervisor may
also elect to refer the position to open recruitment. In such a case, qualified
county applicants will be considered with all other open recruitment
applicants.
   (C)   Open recruitment. If a position remains vacant after considering
departmental and county-wide recruitment, the county will publicly advertise or
post the vacancy as deemed necessary by the Human Resource Director. Outside
applications will be accepted for a minimum of seven calendar days after or
concurrent with departmental and county-wide recruitment. At the option of the
department head/elected official, workforce services or another recruiting
entity may be designated to assist in the application gathering and review
process. All interested applicants must file their applications with the Human
Resource Department. After the recruitment period closes, the Human Resource
Department will forward the qualified applications to the applicable supervisor
to decide which applicants to interview.
   (D)   Concurrent recruitment. At the discretion of a department head/elected
official and where it can be demonstrated that it is in the best interest of
the department/office, recruitment for an open position may run concurrently
(e.g., internal, county and open recruitment may run concurrently).
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.071 HIRING PROCEDURES.

   (C)   (1)   Upon closing the recruitment, the supervisor and/or department
head/elected official over the position being recruited shall review all
applications and select a suitable number of interview candidates that meet the
minimum job qualifications. The interview process shall be coordinated by the
department head/elected official in connection with the Human Resource
Department.
      (2)   Upon completing the interviews and any related selection test(s),
the supervisor and/or department head/elected official shall submit the
recommendation for hire to the Human Resource Director. The Human Resource
Director shall submit the final recommendation for hire to the Board of County
Commissioners for final approval.
   (D)   The county reserves the right to reject any application which
indicates on its face that the applicant does not possess the minimum
qualifications required for the position. Applicants and subsequently hired
applicants who make false statements or who are found to be engaged in any type
of deception or fraud in the application or testing process shall be rejected
or immediately terminated.
   (E)   (1)   Applicants may be subjected to competitive testing which may
include, but not be limited to: determination of whether an employee is
bondable, rating of education and experience, written, oral or physical agility
tests, essential function demonstrations and/or background investigations,
proof of academic attainment and the like.
      (2)   Applicants for positions which require the employee to operate
county vehicles or equipment on public roadways must provide a copy of a Motor
Vehicle Record (“MVR”). MVR’s will be used to assist in the ranking of
applicants who meet the minimum requirements.
   (F)   Public health and safety demands that employees be physically able to
perform the duties of the job classification to which hired. The physical
requirements of the job constitute bona fide occupational qualifications. When
hiring a new employee, job offers are considered conditional if it is
determined that the candidate is required to pass a physical examination by a
qualified medical examiner before commencing work. The results of the exam will
be presented to the department head/elected official, in writing, and will be
treated as a confidential medical record. The county will also accommodate
employees and applicants in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and provide “reasonable accommodation”.
      (1)   The county will pay the cost of any required medical examination.
      (2)   A final candidate for any position may be required to undergo drug
and alcohol testing. (See §
32.220)
   (G)   In conformance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
(Pub. Law No. 99-603), the Human Resource Department shall establish an
employment verification system, and shall verify that all applicants for vacant
positions or persons hired to fill vacant positions are authorized to work
within the boundaries of the United States.
      (1)   The Human Resource Department shall complete or have completed
Immigration and Naturalization Service Form 1-9 prior to the hired employee’s
first day of work and verify work eligibility through examining such documents
as a United States passport, birth certificate, Social Security card, driver’s
license or an alien identification document.
      (2)   Employees must also attest in writing that they are authorized to
work in the United States.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.072 FINAL APPOINTMENT.
   The department head/elected official shall make recommendations for final
appointments for new hires to the Human Resource Director. The Human Resource
Director shall then submit the recommendation for hire to the Board of County
Commissioners for final approval.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.073 ORIENTATION PERIOD.
   (A)   (1)   All appointments to positions within the county, whether new
hires, rehire, reinstatements (affected by reduction-in-force or leave without
pay) or promotion, require an orientation period during which both the county
and the employee can determine compatibility and competence. This period is
regarded as a testing period designed to acquaint the new employee with the
position and allow the employee, supervisor and department head/elected
official to measure fairly the employee’s suitability for the job.
      (2)   The orientation period shall be six months in duration with an
option by elected officials/department heads to extend the period an additional
six months.
      (3)   The orientation period for Sheriff’s office employees shall be 18
months in duration with an option to extend the period an additional six
months. The employment relationship may be terminated at any time during the
new hire orientation period, with or without notice, and with or without cause,
by either the employee or the county.
   (B)   (1)   Promoted employees and all new employees who fail to demonstrate
competence and/or compatibility with the new assignment within the six-month
period or the 18-month period for Sheriff’s office personnel shall be
terminated, unless the department head/elected official decides to extend the
employee’s orientation period.
      (2)   Sheriff’s office personnel that are required to have Peace
Operations Special Training (“POST”) certification (road deputies and
correctional officers) shall have an orientation period that extends through
the POST certification program(s) required for their jobs. In other words, the
orientation period does not end until eighteen months after the POST
certification program is completed.
   (C)   Upon completion of the orientation period, the supervisor shall
conduct a performance review to apprize the employee of their suitability for
the position and determine the employment actions to be recommended to the
Board of County Commissioners.
   (D)   After the employee has completed the designated orientation period the
employee is deemed to be a regular county employee.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.074 RE-EMPLOYMENT OF RETIREES.
   It is the policy of the county to comply with UCA § 49-11-505 (1953, as
amended), regarding the re-employment of retirees. Furthermore, Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) regulations require that there be a bona fide
separation period before a retiree returns to work. Additionally, it is a
violation of IRS regulations to have a “deal” of re-employment arranged prior
to retirement. Therefore, an exemplary employee who is otherwise qualified to
retire under the state’s retirement system (URS) may retire and, at the sole
discretion of the county, become re-employed in a full- or part-time capacity
for any open position which he or she may be qualified for after six months
have passed from the retirement date without post-retirement restrictions under
the above statutory section.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.075 OTHER EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS.
   (A)   Promotion. A promotion is defined as a change in job title and/or
grade recognizing a substantial change in the employee’s duties (see §
32.053). Employees promoted into a higher pay grade will receive an increase
which is to go into effect the pay period following the promotion date.
   (B)   Reinstatement/rehire. 
      (1)   Former employees who left voluntarily, and in good standing may be
reinstated to a vacant position only when their qualifications and ability
indicate a potential for performance which would clearly exceed expected
performance of interested qualified current employees. Previous experience may
be given credit in determining placement of employee on salary schedule and
accrual of benefits if the rehire or reinstatement occurs within one year from
the date of termination.
      (2)   Former employees that were terminated or left county employment
voluntarily without giving proper notice are not deemed to have left the county
in “good standing” and may be denied an opportunity to apply or interview for
an open position.
   (C)   Transfer. When a position becomes vacant in any office/department
within the county, employees are free to make application for the position
without hindrance from other department head/elected officials. However,
employees are encouraged to visit with his or her department head/elected
official before making such application. The employee must be considered on an
equal basis with all other applicants. The office/department accepting the
transferring employee shall accept all accrued leave time as their budgetary
obligation.
   (D)   Reassignment. The effective operation of an office/department requires
periodic changes in work assignments to match functional needs with
capabilities from one position to a similar position in the same classification
and grade within the office/department. Also, employees may request
reassignments, but must do so in writing through established chains of
authority.

toward the completion of an orientation period if hired into a permanent
position.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.093 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.
   Independent contractors hired to perform professional or other specialized
services for the county are not employees of the county and do not qualify for

by-project or service-by-service basis by the Board of County Commissioners.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.094 GRANT POSITIONS.
   (A)   A grant employee occupies a position which is more than 50% funded by
grant monies or another alternate funding source when it is anticipated that
the grant or alternate funding source will continue for more than two years.
Grant employees, may, upon consent of the Board of County Commissioners, accrue

funding is no longer available. Employees accepting grant positions shall be
required to sign a letter acknowledging the conditions of their employment and
the funding source to which the position is tied.
   (B)   Grant monies are funds received from sources other than the county’s

EMPLOYEE CONDUCT, DISCIPLINE AND EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS
§ 32.105 EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of all employees to observe policies
necessary for the proper operation of county functions. Employees still within
their orientation period may be terminated at any time for any reason and are
not entitled to any form of progressive discipline nor are they entitled to
appeal any disciplinary measure. However, all employees that violate county
policy are subject to discipline. Depending upon the circumstances, the county
may reprimand, transfer, suspend, demote, reduce pay or terminate employees who
violate county policy.
   (B)   Grounds for discipline may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Inefficiency;
      (2)   Incompetence;
      (3)   Failure to maintain skills;
      (4)   Inadequate performance levels;
      (5)   Neglect of duty;
      (6)   Misconduct;
      (7)   Disloyalty;
      (8)   Inability to work in harmony with co-workers;
      (9)   Rudeness to the public;
      (10)   Disobedience of a reasonable order of a supervisor;
      (11)   Dishonesty;
      (12)   Insubordination;

      (15)   Misuse of public funds or property;
      (16)   Tardiness;
      (17)   Unapproved absences; and/or
      (18)   Any act adverse to public service.
   (C)   The grounds for discipline list in division (B) above is not
exhaustive and is merely set forth as a guideline. This list should not be
construed as preventing or limiting the county from taking disciplinary action,
including termination, in circumstances where the county deems such action to
be appropriate regardless of whether the county has specifically identified a
written rule or policy. Similarly, employees may be disciplined for violations
of county policy found in other sections of this manual, violations of state or
federal law, or violations of relevant policies, rules or laws promulgated
elsewhere.
   (D)   (1)   Before implementing disciplinary action that may lead to
termination, the employee’s supervisor or department head/elected official
should review the circumstances with the Human Resource Director.
      (2)   Employees may appeal some, but not all, disciplinary actions
through the county’s dispute resolution process as outlined in §§
32.120 through
32.124.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.106 PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE; EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS.
   (A)   Verbal reprimand.
      (1)   A verbal reprimand is a formal conversation between a supervisor
and an employee about a specific aspect of the employee’s performance and/or
conduct. This step is taken when an employee has committed a relatively minor
violation of county policy.
      (2)   When giving the verbal reprimand, the disciplining authority should
identify the specific action(s) that warrant the verbal reprimand, the specific
policies violated, and the correction the employee is expected to make.
      (3)   After the verbal reprimand has been given, the supervisor must
summarize the meeting in writing, including the above cited elements in the
summary, in the event the formal documentation is required at a later date.
This verbal reprimand summary should be delivered to the Human Resource
Director to be placed in the employee’s official personnel file. Verbal
reprimands cannot be appealed or grieved under the county’s dispute resolution
process.
   (B)   Written reprimand.
      (1)   A written reprimand is a formal written notice to the employee
regarding repeated offenses for which a verbal reprimand has already been
given, significant misconduct and/or specific inadequate performance.
      (2)   The written notice should identify the specific action(s) that
warrant the written reprimand, the specific policies violated, and the
correction the employee is expected to make. The employee is asked to
acknowledge receipt of the reprimand by signing and dating the document. If the
employee refuses to acknowledge receipt, a witness can sign and date the
document stating the employee received a copy of this document. The original of
the reprimand, with the employee’s or witness’ signature, shall be sent to the
Human Resources Office for placement in the employee’s official personnel file.
      (3)   Written reprimands cannot be grieved under the county’s dispute
resolution process.
   (C)   Suspension.
      (1)   Suspension without pay is a severe disciplinary action administered
by the supervisor, department head or elected official. A suspension is usually
implemented after an oral reprimand and/or written reprimand have been given
and expectations of the supervisor/department head/elected official are not
being met by the employee, or when an employee commits a serious violation of
county policy. The length of the suspension will typically range from one to
five work days, but may be longer involving more serious matters. Prior to
deciding to suspend an employee without pay, a supervisor must provide that
employee an opportunity to give his or her side in response to the charges.
      (2)   The suspension without pay written notice shall include:
         (a)   The effective date of the suspension, including the time and
date the employee is to report back to work;
         (b)   Details of the incident(s) or action(s) warranting the
disciplinary action including the policies, rules and/or standards violated as
well as the dates and nature of previous direction such as verbal and written
reprimands (if applicable);
         (c)   A statement indicating the specific improvements expected; and
         (d)   Notice that this action may be grieved under this chapter and
the procedure and time limits contained therein.
      (3)   (a)   The employee is asked to acknowledge receipt of the
suspension by signing and dating the document.
         (b)   If the employee refuses to acknowledge receipt, a witness can
sign and date the document stating the employee refused to acknowledge receipt,
but received a copy of this document.
         (c)   The original of the suspension, with the employee’s or witness’
signature, shall be sent to the Human Resources Office for placement in the
employee’s official personnel file.
   (D)   Demotion/termination/dismissal.
      (1)   (a)   Demotion or termination is a severe disciplinary action
administered by the supervisor, department head or elected official. Such an
action usually occurs, but is not required to occur, when previous disciplinary
steps have been taken and there has been inadequate change in the performance
and/or behavior by the employee, or when an employee has committed a serious
violation not appropriately addressed by lesser forms of discipline.
         (b)   Prior to deciding to recommend demotion or termination, a
supervisor must provide that employee an opportunity to give his or her side of
the story in response to the charges.
      (2)   An employee that has fulfilled his or her orientation period that
is recommended for demotion or termination from county employment shall be
given a written statement setting forth the charges upon which the proposed
demotion or termination is based. The statement shall include:
         (a)   The effective date of the notice of proposed demotion or
suspension without pay pending termination;
         (b)   A statement detailing the incident(s) or action(s) warranting
the discipline, including the policies, rules and/or standards violated as well
as the dates and nature of previous supervisor direction such as verbal and
written reprimands, and suspensions (if applicable);
         (c)   An explanation of the employee’s right to a hearing as provided
by this chapter and the procedure and time limits contained therein; and
         (d)   A statement that the decision to demote or terminate will be
based on the findings of the hearing.
      (3)   The employee is asked to acknowledge receipt of the demotion/
termination notice by signing and dating the document. If the employee refuses
to acknowledge receipt, a witness can sign and date the document stating the
employee refused to acknowledge receipt, but received a copy of this document.
      (4)   (a)   The original of the demotion/termination notice, with the
employee’s, or witness’ signature, shall be sent to the Human Resource Office
for processing and placement in the employee’s official personnel file.
         (b)   No decision to recommend demotion or termination of an employee
will be made without prior consultation with the Human Resources Director.
   (E)   Other forms of discipline.
      (1)   If a disciplining authority determines to issue an alternative form
of discipline to those described above, the employee is entitled to the
procedure that is most closely aligned to the discipline that is issued.
      (2)   The Human Resource Director will ultimately determine which
procedure is most appropriate after giving due deference to the disciplining
authority’s opinion as to the appropriate procedure.

§ 32.107 EMPLOYEE GOOD-FAITH REPORTING.
   (A)   General policy. No employee may be subject to any adverse action as
that term is defined in the state’s Protection of Public Employee’s Act
(“UPPEA”), currently codified at UCA § 67-21-1 et seq., because the employee
communicates in good faith the waste or misuse of public funds, property or
manpower, a violation of a federal, state or local law, rule or regulation.
Moreover, no employee may be subject to adverse action because he or she has
objected to or refused to carry out a directive that the employee reasonably
believes violates a federal, state or local law, rule or regulation adopted by
the federal, state or local government.
   (B)   Reporting. An employee may report such conduct by giving written
notice or otherwise formally communicating the alleged conduct to:
      (1)   A person having authority over the alleged perpetrator;
      (2)   The State Attorney General’s office;
      (3)   Law enforcement (if the conduct is criminal in nature); or
      (4)   A member of the Board of County Commissioners or the County Clerk/
Auditor.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, APPEAL AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
§ 32.120 BASIS FOR GRIEVANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section to provide for the reasonable

employees and supervisory personnel should, however, make every possible effort
to settle differences without utilizing of the procedures contained in this
section.
   (B)   Any county employee that has completed an orientation period may file
a grievance as defined and deemed permissible in this chapter.
   (C)   No prejudicial, discriminatory or retaliatory action may be taken, at
any time, by the county against any person for his or her participation in or
statements made in the investigation or settlement of a grievance. This is in
no way meant to limit the right of the county to take appropriate disciplinary
measures for an employee who has provided false statements or accusations.
   (D)   A grievance shall be deemed abandoned if not filed and processed
within the time limitations contained in §§
32.121 through
32.123 below.

However, every proposed salary change must be weighed against the anticipated
affect(s) upon the county budget. Final determination and any changes to the
salary scale will be made by the Board of County Commissioners.
   (B)   Where general, across-the-board raises are awarded, the raise will be
effective on a date determined and approved by the Board of County
Commissioners.
      (1)   Cost-of-living vs. market. Adjustments to the salary schedule may

both. All employees, regardless of employment status, shall receive the
benefits of such general adjustment to the pay plan.
      (2)   Benefits. In determining the total compensation value of the
position, benefits must be considered. Base salary plus cost of benefit equals

§ 32.138 OVERTIME.
   (A)   Overtime shall be avoided if at all possible. For some county
departments and offices overtime is unavoidable. Every effort should be made to

Standards Act (FLSA), the work week shall begin at 12:00 a.m. on Monday and end
at 12:00 a.m. (midnight) on Sunday.

director.

executive, administrative and professional employees.
      (2)   The county determines, after review and approval from Human
Resources and the Board of County Commissioners, which positions to
characterize as exempt from the FLSA. FLSA exempt positions are generally
compensated on a salary basis and do not accrue compensatory time for overtime
hours worked.
   (D)   (1)   For all regular full-time, temporary and seasonal employees,
overtime shall be paid at the rate of time-and-one-half the regular rate of pay
for all hours worked in excess of the 40-hour work week or pay period for law
enforcement personnel, as described in division (A) above.
      (2)   All authorized monetary payments for overtime shall be issued on
the regularly scheduled pay day for the pay period in which it was earned.
   (E)   (1)   The Federal Government has allowed local and state governments
to pay compensatory time (“comp-time”) instead of overtime monetary pay. This
is provided that employees agree to accept comp-time in writing and the rates
at which it is paid are the same at which monetary compensation would have been
paid. For instance, a worker who works more than 40 hours per week will receive
one and one-half hours of comp-time for each hour of work over 40.
      (2)   No employee not eligible for overtime pay shall be eligible for
comp-time pay.
   (F)   Comp-time may only be used when an employee has agreed in a signed
writing to receive overtime through comp-time.
      (1)   All accrued compensatory time shall be used before the use of
accrued vacation or other forms of leave.
      (2)   In no event shall any employee be able to accumulate hours in
excess of the limits established below.
         (a)   Employees engaged in public safety activities, emergency
response activities, or seasonal activities who are not exempt from the Fair
Labor Standards Act overtime rules may accumulate no more than 480 hours.
         (b)   Employees engaged in any other activity not listed above and who
are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime rules may accumulate
no more than 240 hours. Additionally, once such employees have worked 160 hours
of overtime, they may accumulate no more comp-time.
      (3)   No employee may be forced or coerced to accept comp-time in lieu of
payment.
      (4)   Employees must be allowed to use the comp-time within a reasonable
period after the employee makes a request for its use if that will not unduly
disrupt the operations of the department.
   (G)   Records of overtime hours worked shall be maintained by the department
head/elected official and reported monthly to the Clerk/Auditor.
   (H)   When call-out occurs, as in the case of emergencies, snow removal and
the like, the county shall pay a minimum of one-half hour of overtime when the
employee is called out to work other than their regular work schedule.
   (I)   All time spent in training, in conferences, at workshops, meetings and
the like or traveling to such events, when such attendance is required by the
county, shall constitute hours worked and shall be used to calculate overtime
eligibility under the FLSA.

Act, 1985 (COBRA), a person who has been covered under an employer’s group
medial and hospitalization insurance plan as a plan participant or dependent

coverage would otherwise terminate. More specifically, a county employee that
has been employee for six consecutive months prior to their voluntary or
involuntary termination (other than for gross misconduct) from county
employment will be allowed to continue medical and hospitalization insurance
coverage for themselves, their spouse and dependents for up to 18 months from
the date of termination. However, the terminated employee is required to pay
the entire cost of the coverage and coverage may cease if the premium payments
are not made. The county may assess up to 2% of the premium as an
administrative fee.

insurance policies at issue. Life insurance is also provided. Questions
regarding issues should be directed to Human Resources.

§ 32.165 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE.

of a parent, spouse or child, or another “qualifying exigency” shall apply for
FMLA leave. The employee notice shall contain the reason for the leave, the

health condition, must provide medical certification of the serious health
condition within 15 days after the request or as soon thereafter as is
reasonably possible. The county may also require a second or third opinion (at
the county’s expense), periodic re-certification of the serious health
condition (as frequently as every 30 days), and when the leave is a result of
the employee’s own serious health condition, a fitness for duty report to
return to work. The county may deny leave to employees who do not provide
proper general or advanced leave notice or medical certification within
established time frame.
   (C)   Measurement. The county has designated the 12-month period to be
measured forward from the day an employee’s FMLA leave commences, until

§ 32.180 TRAVEL.
   (A)   (1)   Travel expenses associated with authorized trips on county
business, for attendance at conventions, conferences, field trips, educational
courses or meetings and the like, will be paid by the county. The employee will

      (2)   An employee may be accompanied by a spouse on approved county
business trips with the understanding that the county will not pay any of the
costs incurred by the spouse or be responsible for any liability associated
therewith.
      (3)   All absences from work to attend various meetings, training,
seminars, conventions and the like must be approved by the department head/
elected official prior to attendance.
   (B)   All out-of-state travel must be pre-approved by the Board of County
Commissioners. A “Request for Out-of-State Travel” Form should be completed and

for pre-approval. In the event of emergency travel that was not pre-approved,
the Board of County Commissioners should approve the travel immediately upon
return. The approved request should be attached to the expense report for
reimbursement. Routine travel into adjoining states as part of one’s daily job
does not require pre-approval and will not trigger the out-of-state per diem
policy stated below.
      (1)   First class accommodations will be utilized only when a lesser rate
is not available. If a trip requires a choice of air, ground or other type of
travel, reimbursement shall be computed at the lowest rate. An employee may
select another option for his or her convenience, but reimbursement will be
based on the lowest approved rate, unless otherwise approved by the Board of
County Commissioners.
      (2)   Per diem rates for meals (minus incidentals), for out-of-state
travel tied to an out-of-state travel request and approval, shall be reimbursed
to the employee at the M&IE rate set by the United States General Services
Administration (GSA).
   (C)   When an employee is traveling on business that is paid by another
entity, he or she is not entitled to claim reimbursement from the county. If
such travel involves use of a county car, mileage reimbursement received from
another entity shall be paid to the county. Claiming travel expense for the
same trip from two or more entities constitutes a felony punishable by fines
and jail time.
   (D)   The employee is responsible for all personal charges made on direct
billing accounts. This would include, but is not limited to, personal telephone
calls, meals, in-room movies, laundry and dry cleaning and the like.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019; Ord. 2020-05, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 32.181 TRAVEL EXPENSES.

shall be at a rate established by the Board of County Commissioners and allowed
by the IRS, which may be adjusted from year to year. Employees anticipating

§ 32.183 USE OF COUNTY VEHICLES.
   (A)   Each employee must possess a valid state driver’s license before
operating a county vehicle. If needed and available, county cars may be
scheduled through the County Road Office. Employees will be reimbursed for
verifiable (via receipt) expenses such oil, gas, emergency auto service and
parking fees. An employee using a county car is responsible for assuring that
the car interior is cleaned prior to returning the car.
   (B)   Employees required to commute in a county vehicle for valid non-
compensatory business reasons may not use a county vehicle for personal use
other than commuting.
   (C)   If space is available, an employee’s spouse and children, but not
friends, can accompany them on a trip in a county car if it does not conflict
with employees completing their assigned duties or put the spouse and children
in harm’s way.
      (1)   When an employee is considering out-of-town travel with their
spouse and children, they should evaluate the nature of the trip and what might
they may be doing after hours. If the employee will be socializing or
conducting private business, it may be better that the employee take a personal
vehicle. Also, the employee needs to evaluate the need to take a specialty
vehicle.
      (2)   If it is anticipated that the spouse will need to drive the
vehicle, the spouse must sign a volunteer agreement with Human Resources and
submit their driver’s license to the County Risk Manager for review and
clearance by the Department of Motor Vehicle prior to the trip being taken. If
this procedure is not followed and an accident occurs, the employee and spouse
will be responsible for damages incurred. Furthermore, it should be understood
that by allowing a spouse and children to accompany an employee is not an
invitation to unlimited use of county vehicles for personal convenience. It is
expected that prudence and good judgment will be exercised when determining
when and how the vehicle will be used.
   (D)   It is the policy of the county that if a spouse and children
accompanies an employee, it will not be in carrying out normal day-to-day
duties within the county, but rather on those special occasions when out-of-
town trips are required.
   (E)   On-call status employees, such as road deputies, snow removal crews or
other similar job-related duties, will not be allowed to transport spouses or
other family members to social events, church or other non-work related
activities. However, if a specialty vehicle is going out of town for repair
work, training, or for other non-essential work related activities, then the
same rules apply as for motor pool vehicles.
   (F)   County employees are prohibited from smoking, picking up hitch hikers,
talking on cell phones or giving rides to friends while operating county
vehicles. Furthermore, Good Samaritan acts are to be limited to those outlined
in §
32.257.

meetings, conferences, workshops, or other approved programs, the employee may
not submit that meal for reimbursement.
   (B)   An employee will not be reimbursed for in-county meals, unless the
employee is required to live away from home within the county. While in the
field, the employee is entitled to reimbursement at the G.S.A. rate for meals.

§ 32.220 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   General provisions. The county is a drug-free workplace. Employees who
are under the influence of, in possession of, or have in their system, any
illegal or prohibited controlled substances or alcohol while at work are
subject to discipline, up to and including termination. Employees who use,
possess or distribute illegal controlled substances at any time, whether at
work or not, are subject to discipline up to and including termination. County
employees are subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this section. The
county reserves the right to implement a drug testing program consistent with
state law. The county complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

      (1)   It is the policy of the county to provide and foster a drug- and
alcohol-free workplace. A drug- and alcohol-free workplace protects the safety
of the public as well as the county’s workforce. The county believes that the
abuse of drugs and/or alcohol creates a variety of workplace problems including
increased injuries on the job, increased absenteeism, increased financial
burden on the health and benefit programs, decreased employee morale, decreased
productivity, and decline in the quality of services rendered by the county.
      (2)   All employees are prohibited from using, consuming, buying,
possessing or selling drugs or alcoholic beverages in the workplace as
specified by this policy, and are prohibited from reporting to work or being
subject to work (specifically while on-call or on break) with drugs active in
their systems or while under the influence of alcohol. The county also
discourages the detrimental or illegal use of alcohol and/or drugs by its
employees when off-duty.
      (3)   It shall be a condition of employment and continued employment that
all employees and prospective employees comply with the provisions of this
policy and all other relevant state and federal statutes. It shall be a
condition of authorization as a volunteer that all volunteers and prospective
volunteers comply with the provisions of this policy and all other relevant
state and federal statutes. While the county will be supportive of those who
seek help voluntarily with a drug or alcohol addiction, the county will be
equally firm in identifying and disciplining those who continue to violate this
policy and/or do not seek rehabilitative assistance.
      (4)   This policy is intended to conform with the requirements set forth
in the Local Government Entity Drug-Free Workplace Policies Act, UCA, Title 34,
Ch. 41, and all other relevant state and federal statutes including the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The provisions of any applicable law,

and effective day-to-day operations of county departments, including
collaboration and exchange of information within and between county departments
and other branches of government and others.
   (B)   Policy.

communications. Although encouraged to explore the vast resources available on
the Internet, employees should use discretion in the sites that are accessed.
Since all the computer systems and software, as well as the e-mail and Internet
connection, are county-owned, all county policies related to such property are
in effect at all times. Any employee who abuses the privilege of county-
facilitated access to e-mail or the Internet, may be denied access to the
Internet and, if appropriate, be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination. At no time should the employees of the county assume
privacy of computer usage, e-mail or call records. Employees have no right to
keep contents of e-mail and files private. With regard to privacy issues and
legal implications, the county has the right to access and disclose the
contents of electronic files, as required for legal, audit or legitimate county
operational or management purposes.

brought to its attention. Violators are subject to corrective action and
perhaps discipline, and may also be prosecuted under state and federal
statutes.
      (4)   When using county-provided IT resources the employee or volunteer
is a representative of county government at all times. At a minimum, this means
that IT resources will not be used to:

based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age,
disability or political or religious beliefs;
         (b)   Distribute incendiary statements which might incite violence or
describe or promote the use of weapons or devices associated with terrorist
activities; and/or
         (c)   Distribute or solicit sexually-oriented messages or images.

or in support of such activities is prohibited (unless authorized through job
responsibilities).
      (7)   Unacceptable use of information technology resources includes, but

in support of such activities. Illegal activities shall be defined as any
violation of local, state or federal laws;

taken to ensure that grammar and spelling are correct. Mistakes must be
corrected quickly.
   (F)   General governance and oversight of county social media sites. The
county’s social media sites may contain information that represents or appears
to represent the county’s position on policy issues or other matters affecting
county business and/or the positions of the county’s leaders. Thus, the
county’s Office of Administration has general oversight of all county social
media sites.
   (G)   Design and content of county social media sites.
      (1)   Departments and offices will use proper grammar, and where
possible, avoid jargon. Social media tools are often more casual than most
communication tools, but all county social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and
Instagram, shall represent the county appropriately and professionally.
      (2)   Departments and offices may use a departmental logo in their social
media tools. Where appropriate for a particular site, social media pages will
include the county’s logo. Page names should be descriptive of the department/
office.
      (3)   All content-sharing activities, such as video-sharing, shall be in
good taste, appropriate and consistent with the county’s policies.
      (4)   Comments from the public are allowed and encouraged on the county’s
social media sites and shall be monitored daily to ensure the comments meet
certain criteria; the county’s social media sites must be structured narrowly
to focus discussions on a particular interest of the county rather than
creating a “public forum”.
      (5)   Information that is proprietary, subject to the attorney-client
privilege or state or federal privacy laws, and information not subject to
disclosure under the state’s Governmental Records Management Act shall not be
posted on any county social media site. Each department’s social media
administrator shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this rule.
   (H)   Appropriate employee use of social media.
      (1)   Employees assigned to maintain county social media sites shall
adhere to the principles articulated in this policy. Employees shall not work
on departmental social media sites during off-duty hours unless specifically
pre-approved to do so by the employee’s supervisor. All such time worked
outside the employee’s normal work scheduled shall be reported and included in
the employee’s 40-hour work week. Any work in excess of 40 hours will be paid
overtime as required by law and county policy.
      (2)   Consistent with the county’s policies on use of the county’s
telephone and e-mail systems, incidental and occasional personal use of social
media is permitted during work hours provided it is very limited in duration
and does not have a detrimental effect on employee productivity.
      (3)   County resources, work time, social media tools and a county
employee’s official position shall not be used for personal profit or business
interests or to participate in political activity.
      (4)   If commenting on county business, employees should use a disclaimer
which establishes that their comments represent their own opinions and do not
represent those of the county.
      (5)   Employees may not attribute personal statements or opinions to the
county when engaging in private blogging or postings on social media sites.
      (6)   County employees, contract employees for the county and county
volunteers shall not post images, files or text depicting county property,
equipment or personnel in any manner that would adversely affect the reputation
of the county or a county department or office.
      (7)   The following guidelines apply to personal communications using
various forms of social media.
         (a)   Employees should use common sense when using social media sites.
Employees should remember that what they write is public, may be public for a
long time and may spread to large audiences. Employees should refrain from
posting information that they would not want their supervisor or other
employees to read or that they would be embarrassed to see in the newspaper or
on television.
         (b)   The county expects its employees to be truthful, courteous and
respectful toward supervisors, coworkers, citizens, customers and other persons
associated with the county. Employees shall not engage in name-calling,
personal attacks or other such demeaning behavior.

§ 32.227 RETURN TO WORK POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The county strives to create a balance between returning
employees to work at the earliest date following an injury or illness and the
disruption caused by employees returning to work in a limited capacity.
   (B)   Policy. Employees with a medical limitation expected to last 90
calendar days or less may request to return to work on light or restricted
duty. Supervisors/elected officials may use discretion in balancing the

When appropriate, light or restricted duty assignments lasting 90 calendar days
or less may be provided subject to approval by the supervisor/elected official.
   (C)   Procedures.
      (1)   An injured/ill employee may request return to work on light or
restricted duty for up to 90 calendar days. The county has no obligation to
create a light or restricted duty position and may deny the request.
      (2)   Prior to or upon returning to work, the employee must submit a
medical release signed by their medical provider which includes:
         (a)   Medical release to return to work on light or restricted duty
based on the employee’s job description;
         (b)   A list of physical or mental work limitations; and
         (c)   Expected date of return to work with full recovery based on the
employee’s job description.
      (3)   A supervisor/elected official will not contact the employee’s
health care provider. However, a supervisor/elected official may, in
consultation with the Human Resources Department, as an employee to provide
additional information from the health care provider. If no information is
received the request will be denied.
      (4)   Approval to return to work and work options are as follows.
         (a)   If a request for light or restricted duty is approved, the
supervisor/elected official will provide the employee with written notification
outlining the employee’s work related activities consistent with the medical
release.
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the employee to work within the
physical limitations specified by the health care provider and to perform only
the duties assigned as outlined in the approval letter.
         (c)   An employee released for full duty will return to the same or a
comparable position or to a position with a lower grade at the same rate of
pay.
      (5)   An employee who is unable to return to full duty at the end of the
90-calendar day period to a light or restricted duty assignment may take leave
consistent with this policy until medically released for full duty. The
employee may consult with the Human Resource Director or designee to discuss
other options available under county policy.
      (6)   An employee who refuses to return to work either in the current
position or on light or restricted duty after being released by a health care
provider may be terminated unless the employee is entitled to another type of
qualifying leave such as FMLA, ADA or sick leave.

§ 32.228 CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY.
   (A)   Overview. The county officers and employees individually commit
themselves in their official capacity to ethical, businesslike, and lawful
conduct, including appropriate use of their authority and decorum at all times.
Officers and employees must avoid even the appearance of impropriety to ensure
and maintain public confidence in the county. Officers and employees owe a
fiduciary duty to the county and must not act in a manner that is contrary to
that duty or to the interests of the county. Officers and employees must place
the interests of the county over their own personal interests with respect to
the governance, policy, strategic direction and operations of the county.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the intent of the Board of County Commissioners to meet and
exceed those protections against conflicts of interest contained in state law.
Under this policy, a conflict of interest arises when an officer or employee
has a personal interest in a matter that is or may be in conflict with or
contrary to the county’s interests and objectives to such an extent that the
officer or employee is or may not be able to exercise independent and objective
judgment within the context of the best interest of the county. For the
purposes of this policy, an officer or employee’s “personal interest” includes
those of his or her relatives, business associates or other persons or
organizations with whom he or she is closely associated.
      (2)   The following provisions shall serve as a guide to officers with
respect to the affairs of the county.
         (a)   County officers and employees shall not receive, accept, take or
solicit, directly or indirectly, anything of economic value as a gift, gratuity
or favor from a person or entity if it could be reasonably expected that the
gift, gratuity or favor would influence the vote, action or judgment, or be
considered as part of a reward for action or inaction. Officers and employees
are required to submit a report to the county commission and the county’s
Internal Auditor of the actual or estimated value of any gifts or casual
entertainment received as an officer that exceeds $50.
         (b)   The complete confidentiality of proprietary business information
must be respected at all times. Officers and employees are prohibited from
knowingly disclosing such information, or in any way using such information for
personal gain or advancement, or to the detriment of the county, or to
individually conduct negotiations or make contacts or inquiries on behalf of
the county unless officially designated by the county commission.
      (3)   Officers and employees are prohibited from acquiring or having a
financial interest in any property that the county acquires, or a direct or
indirect financial interest in a supplier, contractor, consultant or other
entity with which the county does business. This does not prohibit the
ownership of securities in any publicly-owned company except where such
ownership places the officer in a position to materially influence or affect
the business relationship between the county and such publicly-owned company.
Any other interest in or relationship with an outside organization or
individual having business dealings with the county is prohibited if this
interest or relationship might tend to impair the ability of the officer(s) to
be independent and objective in his or her service to the county.
      (4)   If members of the immediate family of an officer or employee have a
financial interest as specified above, such interest shall be fully disclosed
to the county commission which shall decide if such interest should prevent the
county from entering into a particular transaction, purchase or engagement of
services. The term IMMEDIATE FAMILY means officer’s spouse, parent, dependent
children and other dependent relatives.
      (5)   When a conflict of interest exists, the officer or employee shall
publicly declare the nature of the conflict and may recuse himself or herself
on any official action involving the conflict.
      (6)   Officers and employees may not realize, seek or acquire a personal
interest in a business that does business with the county.
      (7)   Officers and employees shall complete a conflict of interest
disclosure form annually by the end of January. This form shall be signed and
notarized. Completed forms shall be submitted to the Clerk/Auditor and made
available to the public upon request.
      (8)   The Clerk/Auditor shall provide copies of all completed forms to
the County Commission Chair at the end of January each year.
      (9)   The Commission Chair shall review all completed forms and consider
the disclosures. The Commission Chair should make changes to assignments,
duties or contracts deemed appropriate to eliminate or mitigate conflicts of
interest within the county.

OCCUPATIONAL LAWS
§ 32.240 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY.
   No job is so important and no service so urgent that time cannot be taken to
perform work safely. Equipment, materials and operations must be understood
before they are utilized. It is the intent of the county to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations pertaining to the Occupation Safety and Health
Act (OSHA) as established under federal law or state law. To that end, the
county has instituted a comprehensive health and safety program, and its
provisions are found in a separate manual entitled, “San Juan County

   (B)   In conjunction with §
32.220, every employee involved in an on-duty accident or unsafe work practice,

notify law enforcement (city police, county sheriff or highway patrol), the
employee’s immediate supervisor and the County Risk Manager immediately, or as
soon as practical, to report the accident and fill out necessary accident
forms. For clarity, an ACCIDENT is defined as an unfortunate or negligent event
resulting from carelessness, unawareness, ignorance or a combination of causes.
An INCIDENT is defined as wear and tear that can be expected on a vehicle or
equipment through normal usage. It is the employee’s responsibility to secure
the names and addresses of any witnesses in addition to requesting the other
party to prepare a statement to be written and delivered to the County Risk
Management Manager. Notification to the supervisor, the proper accident reports
and related information should be expedited to enable the timely filing of
insurance claims.
   (B)   Failure to notify law enforcement, the supervisor and/or County Risk
Manager of a traffic accident immediately shall result in a reprimand or other
disciplinary action.
   (C)   Depending upon the seriousness of the accident in which the employee
is involved and the causation for such an accident, the employee job status and
compensation could be affected through reassignment, reclassification, demotion
or dismissal. Employees who have their driver’s license suspended or revoked,
who are no longer able to perform the essential functions of the job may be
placed upon leave without pay or be terminated. Each situation shall be given
case-by-case consideration and employees so affected may appeal through the
established grievance procedure.
   (D)   Drug and alcohol testing will occur when an employee has been involved
in an on-duty accident if by observation of the employee and the circumstances
of the accident reasonably could indicate violation of the county’s drug
policy, as detailed in §
32.220.
(Ord. passed 6- -2019)
§ 32.256 VEHICLE SAFETY AND OPERATOR GUIDELINES.
   The county has established standard operating procedures with regard to the
operation of office/department vehicles and equipment. These guidelines
include, but are not limited to, mandatory use of seat belts (driver and all
passengers), driver safety training and the like. Non-compliance by employees
with established standard operating procedures may be grounds for disciplinary
action. All employees who operate county vehicles must complete driver safety
training within one year of hire date. Additionally, county procedures relative
to vehicle operation and safety are contained within the “San Juan County
Safety Manual”, which combined with this policy, constitutes the complete
county vehicle and safety program.

      (1)   Stopping to ask if assistance is necessary; and/or
      (2)   Contacting the road office or law enforcement via mobile phone or
radio, requesting an ambulance, police and/or wrecker service. A courtesy
telephone call can be made to another party in which assistance could be
delivered to the stranded party.
   (C)   County employees should not use county vehicles or equipment to pull
out private vehicles that are stuck, make or assist with repairs to private
vehicles, provide fuel to private vehicles, tow vehicles to any location and
the like. If there is a life threatening situation, employees may use county
vehicles or equipment to move or assist vehicles at the scene or to prevent
further damage or injury.
   (D)   While it is understood that with some assistance, motorists may be
able to continue, there are private companies that are in the business to
provide these types of services and the county should not be in competition
with such businesses. County employees, especially those with mobile phones and
radios, should assist as possible, in accordance with this policy.
   (E)   (1)   This policy is not intended to eliminate those duties that are
regularly performed by law enforcement officers and emergency response team
operations.

procedures of the Sheriff’s office in regards to the call out of wrecker

for a county employee to use his or her county-issued or private cell phone to

when it occurs after the employee has received a written notice that the use is
unauthorized or prohibited under this policy and the employee does not appeal
the written notice, or that which occurs after the employee receives a written
decision from the Commission finding that the personal use is considered
unauthorized or prohibited under this policy.
      (6)   The Commission means to provide broad discretion to the County
Administrator, department heads, and other County boards in authorizing
personal use of public property by employees under their supervision or
control.
      (7)   The Commission recognizes that incidental personal use of public
property by an employee is authorized under UCA § 76-8-402 and further
authorizes incidental personal use under this policy. The Commission considers
incidental personal use to include:
         (a)   Use of public property for limited use of a personal nature when
the individual is using the public property to perform their duties of office,
employment or service under contract; and
         (b)   Use of public property of a personal nature when such use of the
public property:
            1.   Is available to the general public;
            2.   Does not create more than a de minimis cost to the county;
            3.   Is provided or required to be provided to the employee as an
employee benefit or convenience, such as lunchroom and nursing room facilities;
            4.   Is not clearly prohibited by this policy; or
            5.   Is accidental or unintentional and the employee timely
reimburses the cost of the personal use to the county.
   (G)   Procedures and responsibilities.
      (1)   If the County Administrator, a department head or a supervisor or
believes that an employee is using public property in a manner that is not
incidental or should not be authorized, they shall give the employee a written
notice that specifically informs the employee that the personal use is not
considered incidental and will not be considered authorized as of the date of
the written notice, or as of the date of a final written determination by the
Commission of an appeal of the written notice.
      (2)   In determining if personal use should be authorized, the County
Administrator or a department head shall consider whether the personal use of
public property:
         (a)   Does not substantially interfere with the use of the public
property to perform duties of office, employment or service under contract;
         (b)   Creates only a de minimis cost to the county;
         (c)   Creates more than a de minimis cost to the county but provides a
benefit to the county or its employees as determined by the Commission;
         (d)   Creates more than a de minimis cost to the county but the
employee reimburses the county for the cost of the personal use of the public
property at a rate determined by the county;
         (e)   Provides the employee with training and familiarity with the
public property which will allow them to be more proficient with its use to
perform their public duties;
         (f)   Provides support of other agencies or community organizations
which promotes good will between those agencies or community organizations and
the county; or
         (g)   Provides a reasonably arguable benefit to the county.
      (3)   An employee may appeal a written notice provided under this section
to the Commission if they believe their personal use of public property should
be authorized by providing a written request for appeal of the written notice
within five business days of receipt of the written notice. The Commission
shall hear either in writing or in person the person who issued the written
notice and the employee, and make a decision on whether the personal use of the
public property will be authorized or prohibited. The Commission shall inform
the County Administrator and the employee of their decision within ten days of
their decision.
      (4)   The CFO shall notify an employee of the cost to be reimbursed to
the county for personal use of public property, which was not clearly
prohibited by this policy, when that use was accidental or unintentional or due
to damage to public property during personal use of public property by the
employee.
      (5)   The employee shall timely reimburse the county the amounts
determined by the CFO under this section or contest the amount of the
reimbursement to the CEO within five business days of notice from the CFO. The
CFO shall within five business days of receipt of such notice to contest the
amount of reimbursement provide the employee and the CFO a decision regarding
the amount of reimbursement.
      (6)   If the employee does not agree with the decision of the CFO of the
amount of reimbursement for personal use of public property, the employee shall
request an appeal of the CFO’s decision to the County Commission within five
business days of receipt of the CFO’s decision. The Commission shall consider
the requested appeal at their next scheduled meeting and provide the employee
notice of its final decision on the amount of reimbursement within ten business
days of that meeting.

   (A)   Policy.
      (1)   All transactions charged to credit cards shall be made in
compliance with adopted county policies and procedures. County credit cards

Employees should exercise good judgement and act responsibly when using a
county-issued credit card. Credit cards are to be used only by authorized
county government employees.
      (2)   Credit cards should be used as often as possible when making
approved purchases. Employees are discouraged from using personal funds to pay
for county expenses. The county will only reimburse employees who use personal
funds to pay for legitimate county expenses. Department head must provide
written approval of the purchase.
   (B)   Requesting a credit card. Department must request the credit card for
the employee. Before a card is issued, an employee must sign the credit card
usage agreement form. Distribution of credit cards should be limited to those
employees who have a compelling business need. Credit cards should not be
provided to employees and officers who have only an occasional or infrequent
use. The sharing of credit cards is discouraged as it further weakens
oversight.
   (C)   Responsibility for credit cards. The department head is ultimately
accountable for use of any county credit cards assigned to their department.
   (D)   Custody of credit card.
      (1)   The credit card is the property of the county and must be kept
secure at all times.

not be paid.
      (2)   In those cases where sales tax is unavoidable, approval of the tax
must be obtained from the County Clerk/Auditor.
   (F)   Limits and restrictions.
      (1)   Each county credit card is assigned a monthly, daily and per-
transaction limit as determined by the County Administrator.
      (2)   A single purchase cannot be split into multiple transactions to
bypass card limits.
      (3)   If authorized limits become insufficient to meet department needs,
an increase may be requested by the department head.
      (4)   Temporary, per-transaction limit increases for purchases may be
approved on an approved purchase order.
      (5)   County credit cards have been set up to block some transactions
based on supplier’s merchant category code.
      (6)   If the department head believes a transaction should not have been
declined they can request that the category is added to the cardholder’s
profile.
   (G)   Card payments. Purchases made over $1,000 must have an approved
purchase order prior to purchase being made.
   (H)   Credit card reconciliation.
      (1)   All credit card users will submit a credit card reconciliation
monthly, no later than the twenty-fifth of the month, with an itemized receipt

meeting); and
         (e)   Transaction date.
      (3)   If no itemized receipt is submitted a missing receipt form must be
completed signed by both card holder and department head. Excessive use of the
missing receipt form may result in loss of credit card privileges.
   (I)   Unauthorized uses.
      (1)   Any employee found using a county credit card for an unauthorized
use may be subject to the employment disciplinary process, in accordance with
this chapter, the following as examples of unauthorized charges:
         (a)   Personal, non-official expenses of any kind, for any reason;
         (b)   Purchases considered an inappropriate use of public funds;

cash equivalents; and/or
         (d)   Professional services without a current county agreement.
      (2)   Any unauthorized use may result in criminal charges.
      (3)   If a county credit card is used for personal expenditures by
accident the employee can reimburse the county for expense at 150% of the
expense charged (this is a requirement of state law and cannot be waived or
changed by the county).

APPENDIX A: FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT GUIDELINES
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
Basic Leave Entitlement
FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-
protected leave to eligible employees for the following reasons:
   ·   For incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care or child birth;
   ·   To care for the employee’s child after birth, or placement for adoption
or foster care;
   ·   To care for the employee’s spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a
serious health condition; or
   ·   For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform
the employee’s job.
Military Family Leave Entitlements
Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or
call to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a
contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address
certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include attending
certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing
certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling
sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.
FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees
to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered service member during a
single 12-month period. A covered service member is a current member of the
Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a
serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may
render the service member medically unfit to perform his or her duties for
which the service member is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or
therapy; or is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired
list.
Benefits and Protections
During FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee’s health coverage
under any “group health plan” on the same terms as if the employee had
continued to work. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored
to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and
other employment terms. Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any
employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an employee’s leave.
Eligibility Requirements
Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least
one year, for 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, and if at least 50
employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.
Definition of Serious Health Condition
A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or
mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care
facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition
that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the
employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in
school or other daily activities.
Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met
by a period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days combined
with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen
of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a
chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing
treatment.
Use of Leave
An employee does not need to use this leave entitlement in one block. Leave can
be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically
necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned
medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the employer’s operations. Leave
due to qualifying exigencies may also be taken on an intermittent basis.
Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid Leave.
Employees may choose or employers may require use of accrued paid leave while
taking FMLA leave. In order to use paid leave for FMLA leave, employees must
comply with the employer’s normal paid leave policies.
Employee Responsibilities
Employees must provide 30 days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave
when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days notice is not possible, the employee
must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with an
employer’s normal call-in procedures.
Employees must provide sufficient information for the employer to determine if
the leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and
duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee is
unable to perform job functions, the family member is unable to perform daily
activities, the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health
care provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave.
Employees also must inform the employer if the requested leave is for a reason
for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees also may be
required to provide a certification and periodic recertification supporting the
need for leave.
Employer Responsibilities
Covered employers must inform employees requesting leave whether they are
eligible under FMLA. If they are, the notice must specify any additional
information required as well as the employees’ rights and responsibilities. If
they are not eligible, the employer must provide a reason for the
ineligibility.
Covered employers must inform employees if leave will be designated as FMLA-
protected and the amount of leave counted against the employee’s leave
entitlement. If the employer determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected,
the employer must notify the employee.
Unlawful Acts by Employers
FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:
   ·   Interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided
under FMLA;
   ·   Discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice
made unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to
FMLA,
Enforcement
An employee may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring
a private lawsuit against an employer. FMLA does not affect any Federal or
State law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law or
collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave
rights.

CASH RECEIPT AND DEPOSIT POLICY
§ 33.015 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish a uniform control design for
all departments of the county that receive cash. This subchapter has been
developed by the Treasurer with input received from the Clerk/Auditor, external
auditors and approved by the Board of County Commissioners, who ultimately is
responsible for the overall design and implementation of organizational
controls. Over time it is expected this subchapter will be adjusted for changes
in systems and organizational structure, at which time the Treasurer will
propose changes to the Board of County Commissioners for review and approval.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 33.016 CASH RECEIPTS AT SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL LOCATIONS.
   (A)   All funds received are entered into the accounting system at the time
of the transaction or if the transaction occurs at a location without access to
the accounting system the funds will be logged into a pre-numbered receipt book
with enough detail to determine where/who the funds came from, the purpose for
receiving the funds, the method of payment (cash, check, credit card and the
like) and designate the appropriate account. Manual receipts should have three
copies: customer copy; Treasurer copy; and a location copy.
   (B)   At the end of each day, the person responsible for receiving cash will
close out his, her or their cash drawer, reconcile the system generated report
to the cash in the drawer, place cash, checks and credit card receipts received
along with the report in a deposit bag and deliver it to the Treasurer’s office
or place it in a secure (locked) place for deposit as soon as possible but at
least every three days. Choosing two set days per week (e.g., Tuesday and
Thursday) is recommended.
   (C)   Void/adjusted transactions, if a transaction needs to be voided or
adjusted it should be done by someone who does not receive cash, if an office
doesn’t have enough employees to have adjustments made by a supervisor that
doesn’t receive cash, two employees will sign off on the adjustment or voided
transaction explaining the circumstances causing the adjustment. If the
location is using a manual receipt book all copies of the receipt should be
present for any voided receipt. The system should be designed to generate a
report of all adjusted/voided transactions to facilitate monitoring of this
process.
   (D)   Every effort should be made to ensure large quantities of cash are not
on hand at any location overnight. If a location has a large transaction or
series of transactions leaving cash on hand over $2,000, the deposit should be
made in the same day.
   (E)   When deposits are made with the Treasurer’s office the employee making
the deposit will turn over the funds and watch as it is counted, receive a
receipt detailing the amount, date of receipt and the signature of the
Treasurer’s office employee who took custody of the funds. This receipt will be
returned to the location and kept with the receipt records. In order to receive
a receipt, the originating department should bring two signed copies of the
ticket, one for the Treasurer and one for the originating department to keep.
Any discrepancy in the funds being deposited and the supporting documentation
should occur when custody of the funds changes.
   (F)   The Treasurer’s office enters the deposit into the accounting system
and takes funds to the bank. Deposits are made each business day by the
Treasurer’s office.
   (G)   Mail will be opened by an authorized employee and any correspondence
containing payments will be removed and processed prior to distributing mail to
individual persons or departments.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 33.017 DEPOSITS WITH TREASURER.
   (A)   A Treasurer’s office employee will receive all department funds, count
the funds, compare the amount received to the supporting documentation provided
and give a receipt to the employee who turned over the funds with the amount
received, date and that employee’s name and signature. The originating
department needs to bring two signed copies of each cash ticket, one for the
Treasurer and one for the originating department to keep.
   (B)   An employee from the Treasurer’s office enters the information from
the deposit into the accounting system.
   (C)   Each day, the Treasurer will compile all cash and checks received,
match the total to the total receipts in the accounting system and create a
deposit slip (deposit information should be sufficiently detailed to allow a
reviewer to trace individual transactions from satellite locations into the
deposit and verify that the funds were received by the bank).
   (D)   Copies of deposit slips are maintained and used to reconcile bank
statements to the accounting records.
   (E)   Department heads for departments that collect cash should review the
revenue recorded into the accounting system with their copy of the deposits to
ensure correct recording of cash. Where practicable the system should be
designed to only allow receipts for cash receipts to be recorded to accounts
that pertain to that office or department.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 33.018 REAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS.
   (A)   Real property tax payments are made directly to the Treasurer. They
are entered into the tax system immediately upon receipt. Payments will be
either for pre-payments, for current taxes or for redemption (past due) taxes.
   (B)   If a parcel is underpaid by $5 or less, the Treasurer’s office is
authorized to adjust the amount due to eliminate the outstanding balance. If
the underpayment is greater than $5, the Treasurer’s office will bill the
taxpayer for the additional amount due. At the end of each business day, cash
receipts entered into the tax system will be balanced with the cash and checks
received for the day, A deposit for the tax receipts will then be made the next
business day. Reports for each type of receipt will be balanced with the bank
and PTIF (Public Treasurer’s Investment Fund) balances each day.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 33.019 ASSESSOR’S TAX PAYMENTS.
   Each morning, the Assessor’s office will bring to the Treasurer’s office a
report of the motor vehicle and personal property taxes received by the
Assessor the previous day. The Treasurer will verify the receipt totals and
return a signed T-bill for the receipts to the Assessor. The Assessor’s office
deposits the PTIF receipts and the Treasurer’s office deposits the UPP
receipts.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 1-19-2021)

purchased during a tax sale is habitable or in any particular condition.

availability, validity or existence of water rights associated with any of the
properties sold during a tax sale.

from the time of sale until the recording of the Auditor’s tax deed to a

PURCHASES; AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS
§ 34.025 PURCHASES OF SPECIFIC AMOUNTS.
   (A)   Purchases up to $1,000. All procurements of services and goods in an
amount less than $1,000 may be approved by the department director; provided,
such procurements have been budgeted for within the department and are in line
with the budgeted purposes and responsibilities of said department. A
department or division may not spend a maximum of $50,000 in a fiscal year with
an individual vendor using the small purchase limit. This rule cannot be used
for ongoing services. Contracts at this limit, if required, can be executed by
the Purchasing Agent. No quotes are required at this limit.
   (B)   Purchases over $1,000 and up to $5,000. 
      (1)   All procurements of services and goods in an amount over $1,000 and
up to $5,000 must have a purchase order approved by the department director and
the Purchasing Agent prior to initiating the purchase.
      (2)   Descriptions of items or services will use sufficient and
descriptive terminology to allow the reviewer to understand what is being
purchased and why, part numbers by themselves are not sufficient. When the
individual procurement item cost is more than $1,000 for one or more items and
the total procurement is less than $5,000, the department or division must
obtain competitive quotes.
      (3)   All purchases between this limit shall be made after obtaining a
minimum of two bids. The agency must purchase the item/service from the
supplier offering the lowest quote meeting specifications unless one is of a
higher and better quality. Contracts at this limit can be executed by the
Purchasing Agent.
   (C)   Purchases over $5,000 and up to $15,000.
      (1)   All goods, services and equipment over $5,000, but less than
$15,000, require (at a minimum) three written quotes from three different
vendors. Quotes may be provided by fax, mail, e-mail or by printing listed
prices from vendor websites. The Purchasing Agent may require the department to
conduct an RFP to ensure pricing is competitive. A waiver of the required
minimum number of quotes will be granted by the Purchasing Agent or designee
upon a showing that a diligent effort was made to obtain the quotes or a sole
source justification has been provided and approved. All quotes (and wavier, if
applicable) shall be submitted electronically with the requisition or
contracted award as part of the formal purchasing record. The department
director must sign the quote selected for the procurement.
      (2)   Once quotes have been obtained, the method of procurement is
determined by type of expenditure and total cost, as follows:
         (a)   Goods/equipment under $10,000: county purchase order;
         (b)   Goods/equipment between $10,000 and $15,000: may constitute a
capital purchase and requires assistance from the Purchasing Agent and requires
a county purchase order with appropriate terms and conditions; and
         (c)   Services between $5,000 and $15,000: county-approved contract is
required executed by the County Board of Commissioners unless delegated to the

the exemption of those requirements must be attached. Purchases within this
range will need a county-approved contract.
   (D)   Purchases over $15,000 and up to $50,000. Purchases over $15,000
require a written contract to be approved in an open meeting. Purchases between
$15,000 which are ongoing services must be put out for competitive bid with a
public notice. All procurements of services and goods in an amount over $50,000
must be put out for competitive bid with a public notice and to be prepared and
approved by the Department Director, Supervisor, Purchasing Agent and the
County Board of Commissioners. (See §§
34.040 through

(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.026 AVOIDANCE OF APPROVAL AND WRITTEN CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS.
   Purchases shall not be divided into smaller purchases for the purpose of
evading the approval process required by this policy, or for the purpose of
avoiding the need to obtain a written contract.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.027 SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Sole source procurement shall be used only if a requirement is
reasonably available from a single supplier.
      (2)   A requirement for a particular proprietary item does not justify
sole source procurement if there is more than one potential bidder or offeror
for that item.
   (B)   Examples of circumstances which could necessitate sole source
procurement are:
      (1)   Where the compatibility of equipment, accessories, replacement
parts or service is the paramount consideration;
      (2)   Where a sole supplier’s item is needed for trial use or testing;
      (3)   Procurement of items for resale; and
      (4)   Procurement of public utility services.
   (C)   (1)   The determination as to whether a procurement shall be made as a
sole source shall be made by the Purchasing Agent.
      (2)   Each request shall be submitted in writing by the using agency.
Such officer may specify the application of such determination and its
duration.
      (3)   In cases of reasonable doubt, competition should be solicited.

of goods and services for any amount.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.041 NEGOTIATION OF ADJUSTMENTS.
   In the event that bids exceed available funds and the lowest responsive and
responsible bid does not exceed funds available by more than 5%, the Board may,
where time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a
reduced scope, negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in
the bid requirements, with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, in
order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)

furnished and will not necessarily be returned. Samples must be labeled or
otherwise identified as called for by the purchasing agency.
      (5)   Bid security. Bid bonds and performance bonds or other security may
be required for supply contracts or service contracts as the Purchasing Agent
deems advisable to protect the interests of the purchasing agency. Any such
requirements must be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds
should not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror
responsibility.
      (6)   Bid price. Bid prices submitted in response to an invitation for

Purchasing Agent, names and addresses on bidder lists shall be available for
public inspection.
   (I)   Pre-bid conferences. Pre-bid conferences may be conducted to explain
the procurement requirements. They shall be announced to all prospective
bidders known to have received an invitation for bids. The conference should be
held long enough after the invitation for bids has been issued to allow bidders
to become familiar with it, but sufficiently before bid opening to allow
consideration of the conference results in preparing their bids. Nothing stated
at the pre-bid conference shall change the invitation for bids unless a change
is made by written amendment as provided in §
34.043 of this chapter and the invitation for bids and the notice of the pre-
bid conference shall so provide. If a written summary of the conference is
deemed advisable by the Purchasing Agent, a copy shall be supplied to all those
prospective bidders known to have received an invitation for bids and shall be

§ 34.043 AMENDMENTS TO INVITATION FOR BIDS.
   (A)   Application. Amendments should be used to:
      (1)   Make any changes in the invitation for bids such as changes in
quantity, purchase descriptions, delivery schedules and opening dates;
      (2)   Defects or ambiguities; or
      (3)   Furnish to other bidder’s information given to one bidder if such
information will assist the other bidders in submitting bids or if the lack of
such information would be equitable to other bidders.
   (B)   Form. Amendments to invitation for bids shall be identified as such
and shall require that the bidder acknowledge receipt of all amendments issued.
   (C)   Distribution. Amendments shall be sent to all prospective bidders
known to have received an invitation for bids.
   (D)   Timeliness. Amendments shall be distributed within a reasonable time
to allow prospective bidders to consider them in preparing their bids. If the

possible such time shall be increased in the amendment or, if necessary, by
telegram or telephone and confirmed in the amendment.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.044 PRE-OPENING MODIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS.
   (A)   Procedure.

telegraphic notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bid
prior to the time set for bid opening.
      (2)   A telegraphic modification or withdrawal received by telephone
prior to bid opening from the receiving telegraph company will be effective if
the telegraph company confirms the message by sending a copy of the written
telegram showing that the message was received at such office prior to bid
opening.
   (B)   Disposition of bid security. Bid security, if any, shall be returned
to the bidder when withdrawal of the bid is permitted.
   (C)   Records. All documents relating to the modification or withdrawal of
bids shall be made a part of the appropriate procurement file.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.045 LATE BIDS, LATE WITHDRAWAL AND LATE MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Any bid, withdrawal or modification received at the address designated
in the invitation for bids after the time and date set for receipt of bids at
the place designated for receipt is late.
   (B)   No late bid, late withdrawal or late modification will be considered
unless received before contract award, and the bid, withdrawal or modification
would have been timely, but for the action or inaction of personnel directly
serving the procurement activity or lateness in the delivery of the bid
otherwise not attributable to the bidder’s fault or negligence.
   (C)   The Purchasing Agent, in consultation with the County Attorney’s
office, shall determine whether to accept a late bid, late withdrawal or late
modification. All documents relating to the late bid, late withdrawal or late
modification shall be made a part of the appropriate procurement file.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.046 RECEIPT, OPENING AND RECORDING OF BIDS.
   (A)   Receipt. Upon receipt, all bids and modifications will be time
stamped, but not opened. They shall be stored in a secure place until bid
opening time.
   (B)   Opening and recording. Bids and modifications shall be opened
publicly, in the presence of one or more witnesses, at the time and place
designated in the invitation for bids. The names of the bidders, the bid price,
and such other information as is deemed appropriate by the Purchasing Agent,
shall be read aloud or otherwise be made available. The opened bids shall be
available for public inspection, except to the extent the’ bidder designates
trade secrets or other proprietary data to be confidential as set forth in
division (C) below. Material so designated shall accompany the bid and shall be
readily separable from the bid in order to facilitate public inspection of the
non-confidential portion of the bid. Make and model, and model or catalogue
numbers of the items offered, deliveries and terms of payment shall be publicly
available at the time of bid opening regardless of any designation to the
contrary.
   (C)   Confidential data. The Purchasing Agent shall examine the bids to
determine the validity of any requests for non-disclosure of trade secrets and
other proprietary data identified in writing. If the parties do not agree as to
the disclosure of data, the Purchasing Agent shall inform the bidders in
writing what portions of the bids will be disclosed.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.047 MISTAKES IN BIDS.
   (A)   No correction. If a mistake is attributable to an error judgment, the
bid may not be corrected. Bid correction or withdrawal by reason of an
inadvertent, non-judgmental mistake is permissible, but at the discretion of
the Purchasing Agent and to the extent it is not contrary to the interest of
the purchasing agency or the fair treatment of the other bidders.
   (B)   Mistakes discovered before opening. A bidder may correct mistakes
discovered before bid opening by withdrawing or correcting the bid as provided
in §
34.044 of this chapter.
   (C)   Confirmation of bid. When it appears from a review of the bid that a
mistake has been made, the bidder should be requested to confirm the bid.
Situations in which confirmation should be requested include obvious, apparent
errors on the face of the bid or a bid unreasonably lower than the other bids
submitted. If the bidder alleges mistake, the bid may be corrected or withdrawn
if the conditions set forth in divisions (A) above and (D) and (F) below are
met.
   (D)   Mistakes discovered after opening, but before award. This division (D)
sets forth procedures to be applied in three situations described in divisions
(D)(1), (D)(2) and (D)(3) below in which mistakes in bids are discovered after
opening, but before award.
   (E)   Minor informalities. Minor informalities are matters of form rather
than substance evident from the bid document, or insignificant mistakes that
can be waived or corrected without prejudice to other bidders; that is, the
effect on price, quantity, quality, delivery or contractual conditions is not
significant. The Purchasing Agent may waive such informalities. Examples
include the failure of a bidder to:
      (1)   Return the number of signed bids required by the invitation for
bids;
      (2)   Sign the bid, but only if the unsigned bid is accompanied by other
material indicating the bidder’s intent to be bound;
      (3)   Acknowledge receipt of an amendment to the invitation for bids, but
only if:
         (a)   It is clear from the bid that the bidder received the amendment
and intended to be bound by its terms; or
         (b)   The amendment involved had a negligible effect on price,
quantity, quality or delivery.
   (F)   Mistakes where intended bid is evident. If the mistake and the
intended bid are clearly evident on the face of the bid document, the bid shall
be corrected to the intended bid and may not be withdrawn. Examples of mistakes
that may be clearly evident on the face of the bid document are typographical
errors, errors in extending unit prices, transposition errors and arithmetical
errors.
   (G)   Mistakes where intended bid is not evident. A bidder may be permitted
to withdraw a low bid if:
      (1)   A mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document, but
the intended bid is not similarly evident; or
      (2)   The bidder submits proof of evidentiary value which clearly and
convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made.
   (H)   Mistakes discovered after award. Mistakes shall not be corrected after
award of the contract.
   (I)   Written approval or denial required. The Purchasing Agent shall
approve or deny, in writing, a bidder’s request to correct or withdraw a bid.
Such approval or denial may be so indicated on the bidder’s written request for
correction or withdrawal.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.048 BID EVALUATION AND AWARD.
   (A)   General. The contract is to be awarded to the lowest responsible and
responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in
the invitation for bids. The invitation for bids shall set forth the
requirements and criteria which will be used to determine the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder. No bid shall be evaluated for any requirements or
criteria that are not disclosed in the invitation for bids. An invitation for
bids, a request for proposals or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or
all bids or proposals may be rejected, in whole or in part, when it is in the
best interest of the purchasing agency, as determined by the purchasing agency.
In the event of cancellation of the solicitation or rejection of all bids or
proposals received in response to a solicitation, the reasons for cancellation
or rejection shall be made a part of the bid file and shall be available for
public inspection and the purchasing agency shall:
      (1)   Re-solicit new bids using the same or revised specifications; or
      (2)   Withdraw the requisition for supplies or services.
   (B)   Responsibility and responsiveness. Responsibility of prospective
contractors is covered by responsibility and pre-qualification of these
regulations.
   (C)   Product acceptability. The invitation for bids shall set forth the
evaluation criteria to be used in determining product acceptability. It may
require the submission of bid samples, descriptive literature, technical data
or other material. It may also provide for:
      (1)   Inspection or testing of a product prior to award for such
characteristics as quality or workmanship;
      (2)   Examination of such elements as appearance, finish, taste or feel;
or
      (3)   Other examinations to determine whether it conforms with any other
purchase description requirements. The acceptability evaluation is not
conducted for the purpose of determining whether one bidder’s item is superior
to another, but only to determine that a bidder’s offering is acceptable as set
forth in the invitation for bids. Any bidder’s offering which does not meet the
acceptability requirements shall be rejected.
   (D)   Determination of lowest bidder. Bids will be evaluated to determine
overall economy for the intended use, in accordance with the evaluation
criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. Examples of such criteria
include, but are not limited to, transportation cost, energy cost, ownership
and other identifiable costs or life-cycle cost formula. Evaluation factors
need not be precise predictors of actual future costs, but to the extent
possible such evaluation factors shall:
      (1)   Be reasonable estimates based on upon information the purchasing
agency has available concerning future use; and
      (2)   Treat all bids equitably.
   (E)   Extension of time for bid or proposal acceptance. After opening bids
or proposals, the Purchasing Agent may request bidders or offerors to extend
the time during which their bids or proposals may be accepted; provided that,
with regard to bids, no other change is permitted. The reasons for requesting
such extension shall be documented.
   (F)   Only one bid or proposal received. If only one responsive bid is
received in response to an invitation for bids (including multi-step bidding),
an award may be made to the single bidder if the Purchasing Agent finds that
the price submitted is fair and reasonable, and that either other prospective
bidders had reasonable opportunity to respond, or there is not adequate time
for re-solicitation. Otherwise, the bid may be rejected and:
      (1)   New bids or offers may be solicited;
      (2)   The proposed procurement may be canceled; or
      (3)   If the Purchasing Agent determines in writing that the need for the
supply of service continues, but that the price of the one bid is not fair and
reasonable and there is no time for re-solicitation or re-solicitation would
likely be futile, the procurement may then be conducted under a sole source
procurement or an emergency procurement as appropriate.
   (G)   Multiple or alternate bids or proposals. Unless multiple or alternate
bids or offers are specifically provided for, the solicitation shall state they
will not be accepted. When prohibited, the multiple or alternate bids or offers
shall be rejected although a clearly indicated base bid shall be considered for
award as though it were the only bid or offer submitted by the bidder or
offeror. The provisions of this division (G) shall be set forth in the
solicitation, and if multiple or alternate bids are allowed, it shall specify
their treatment.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.049 TIE BIDS.
   (A)   Definition. Tie bids are low responsive bids from responsible bidders
that are identical in price.
   (B)   Award. Award shall not be made by drawing lots, except as set forth
below, or by dividing business among identical bidders. In the discretion of
the Purchasing Agent, award shall be made in any permissible manner that will
discourage tie bids. Procedures which may be used to discourage tie bids
include:
      (1)   Where identical low bids include the cost of delivery, award the
contract to the bidder farthest from the point of delivery;
      (2)   Award the contract to the identical bidder who received the
previous award and continue to award succeeding contracts to the same bidder so
long as all low bids are identical;
      (3)   Award to the identical bidder with the earliest delivery date;
      (4)   Award to a Utah resident bidder or for a Utah-produced product
where other tie bid(s) are from out of state;
      (5)   If price is considered excessive or for other reason such bids are
unsatisfactory, reject all bids and negotiate a more favorable contract in the
open market; or
      (6)   If no permissible method will be effective in discouraging tie bids
and a written determination is made so stating, award may be made by drawing
lots.
   (C)   Record. Records shall be made of all invitations for bids on which tie
bids are received showing at least the following information:
      (1)   The invitation for bids;
      (2)   The supply, service or construction item;
      (3)   All the bidders and the prices submitted; and
      (4)   Procedure for resolving tie bids.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 34.050 MULTI-STEP SEALED BIDDING.
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      MULTI-STEP SEALED BIDDING. A two-phase process consisting of a technical
first phase composed of one or more steps in which bidders submit unpriced
technical offers to be evaluated by the purchasing agency, and a second phase
in which those bidders whose technical offers are determined to be acceptable
during the first phase have their price bids considered. It is designed to
obtain the benefits of competitive sealed bidding by award of a contract to the
lowest responsive, responsible bidder and at the same time obtain the benefits
of the competitive sealed proposals procedure through the solicitation of
technical offers and the conduct of discussions to arrive at technical offers
and terms acceptable to the purchasing agency and suitable for competitive
pricing.
   (B)   Use. The multi-step sealed bidding method will be used when the
Purchasing Agent deems it to the advantage of the purchasing agency. Multi-step
sealed bidding will thus be used when it is considered desirable.
      (1)   To invite and evaluate technical offers to determine their
acceptability to fulfill the purchase description requirements;
      (2)   To conduct discussions for the purposes of facilitating
understanding of the technical offer and purchase description requirements and,
where appropriate, obtain supplemental information, permit amendments of
technical offers or amend the purchase description;
      (3)   To accomplish divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above prior to soliciting
priced bids; and
      (4)   To award the contract to the lowest responsive and responsible
bidder in accordance with the competitive sealed bidding procedures.
   (C)   Pre-bid conferences in multi-step sealed bidding. Prior to the
submission of unpriced technical offers, a pre-bid conference as contemplated
by pre-bid conferences may be conducted by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing
Agent may also hold a conference of all bidders at any time during the
evaluation of the unpriced technical offers.
   (D)   Procedure for phase one of multi-step sealed bidding.
      (1)   Form. Multi-step sealed bidding shall be initiated by the issuance
of an invitation for bids in the form required by the content of the invitation
for bids, except as hereinafter provided. In addition to the requirements set
forth above, the multi-step invitation for bids shall state:
         (a)   Unpriced technical offers are requested;
         (b)   Whether price bids are to be submitted at the same time as
unpriced technical offers; if they are, such price bids shall be submitted in a
separate sealed envelope;
         (c)   It is a multi-step sealed bid procurement, and priced bids will
be considered only in the second phase and only from those bidders whose
unpriced technical offers are found acceptable in the first phase;
         (d)   The criteria to be used in the evaluation of the unpriced
technical offers;
         (e)   The purchasing agency, to the extent the Purchasing Agent finds
necessary, may conduct oral or written discussions of the unpriced technical
offers;
         (f)   Bidders may designate those portions of the unpriced technical
offers which contain trade secrets or other proprietary data which are to
remain confidential; and
         (g)   The item being procured shall be furnished generally in
accordance with the bidder’s technical offer as found to be finally acceptable
and shall meet the requirements of the invitation for bids.
      (2)   Amendments to the invitation for bids. After receipt of unpriced
technical offers, amendments to the invitation for bids shall be distributed
only to bidders who submitted unpriced technical offers and they shall be
allowed to submit new unpriced technical offers or to amend those submitted.
If, in the opinion of the Purchasing Agent, a contemplated amendment will
significantly change the nature of the procurement, the invitation for bids
shall be canceled in accordance with the cancellation of solicitations of these
regulations and a new invitation for bid issued.
      (3)   Receipt and handling of unpriced technical offers. Unpriced
technical offers shall not be opened publicly nor be disclosed to unauthorized
persons. Bidders may request non-disclosure of trade secrets and other
proprietary data identified in writing.
      (4)   Evaluation of unpriced technical offers. The unpriced technical
offers submitted by bidders shall be evaluated solely in accordance with the
criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The unpriced technical offers
shall be categorized as:
         (a)   Acceptable;
         (b)   Potentially acceptable, that is, reasonably susceptible of being
made acceptable; or
         (c)   Unacceptable. The Purchasing Agent shall record in writing the
basis for finding an offer unacceptable and make it part of the procurement
file.
         (d)   The Purchasing Agent may initiate phase two of the procedure if,
in the Purchasing Agent’s opinion, there are sufficient acceptable unpriced
technical offers to assure effective price competition in the second phase
without modification or alteration of the offers. If the Purchasing Agent finds
that such is not the case, the Purchasing Agent shall issue an amendment to the
invitation for bids or engage in technical discussions as set forth in division
(D)(5) below.
      (5)   Discussion of unpriced technical offers. Discussion of its
technical offer may be conducted by the Purchasing Agent with any bidder who
submits an acceptable or potentially acceptable technical offer. During the
course of such discussions the Purchasing Agent shall not disclose any
information derived from one unpriced technical offer to any other bidder. Once
discussions are begun, any bidder who has not been notified that its offer has
been finally found unacceptable may submit supplemental information modifying
or otherwise amending its technical offer at any time until the closing date
established by the Purchasing Agent. Such submissions may be made at the
request of the Purchasing Agent or upon the bidder’s own initiative.
      (6)   Notice of unacceptable unpriced technical offer. When the
Purchasing Agent determines a bidder’s unpriced technical offer to be
unacceptable, such officer shall notify the bidder. Such bidders shall not be
afforded an additional opportunity to supplement technical offers.
   (E)   Mistakes during multi-step sealed bidding.
      (1)   Mistakes may be corrected or bids may be withdrawn during phase
one;
      (2)   Before unpriced technical offers are considered;
      (3)   After any discussions have commenced under the procedure for phase
one of multi-step sealed bidding, discussion of unpriced technical offers; or

to award shall be made showing the basis on which the award was found to be
most advantageous to the purchasing agency based on the factors set forth in
the request for proposals.
   (D)   One proposal received. If only one proposal is received in response to
a request for proposals, the Purchasing Agent may, as such agent deems
appropriate, either make an award or, if time permits, re-solicit for the
purpose of obtaining additional competitive sealed proposals.
   (E)   Publicizing awards. After a notice to award is issued, a contract is

§ 34.060 EXCEPTIONS TO COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSAL PROCESS.
   (A)   The Purchasing Agent or designee may determine that for a given
request it is either not practicable or not advantageous for the county to
procure a commodity or service referenced in the above by soliciting
competitive sealed proposals. When making this determination, the Purchasing
Agent or designee may take into consideration whether the potential cost of
preparing, soliciting and evaluating competitive sealed proposals is expected
to exceed the benefits normally associated with such solicitations. In the
event of such a determination, the Purchasing Agent or designee may elect to
utilize an alternative, more cost effective procurement method, which may
include, but shall not be limited to, direct negotiations with a qualified
vendor or contractor.

Commissioners may make the awarding of a contract subject to further

§ 35.001 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for the county
to assist the county in identifying actions that involve the unconstitutional
taking, damaging or exaction of private real property without the payment of
just compensation as required by the Constitution of the United States and of
the state.
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004)
§ 35.002 DEFINITION.
   CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUES are actions involving the physical or
regulatory taking of private real property by the county that might require
compensation to a private real property owner under:
   (A)   The Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States;
   (B)   Article I, § 22, of the Utah Constitution; or
   (C)   Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking
of private real property by a governmental entity.
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004)
§ 35.003 GUIDELINES.
   (A)   The following guidelines shall be considered by the county when taking
any action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private
real property. The county should review the following to determine and identify
whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking issues. It
is the policy of the county that no individual bear burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the community as a whole.
   (B)   A “Yes” answer to any of the following questions could raise the
implication of a taking or damaging of private property for which compensation
may be required:
      (1)   Does the action result in a permanent or inevitably recurring
physical occupation of private property?
      (2)   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or
grant an easement to the county without the payment of just compensation?
      (3)   Does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent ongoing
nuisance, originating on county property, that impacts neighboring lands so
that their owners or occupants sustain a special and unreasonable interference
with the quiet enjoyment of the property?
      (4)   Does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership
such as the right to reasonable access, the right to light, air and view within
the right-of-way of an abutting public street or the right to exclude others
from private property?
      (5)   Does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected
and vested right, such as the right to continue a nonconforming use; the right
to have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a
complete application was submitted; legally issued subdivision play approvals,
building permits or licenses; or other protected property interests?
      (6)   Does the action impose a severe economic burden that is
inappropriately unfair when considered in light of: the burden placed on the
property owner; the nature of the government action and benefit; and the
property owner’s investment-backed expectations?
      (7)   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically
viable use of the property in a situation where the proposed use does not
constitute a nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety?
      (8)   Does the action limit the use of private property without
substantially advancing a legitimate public interest?
      (9)   Has the county failed to demonstrate by an individualized
determination that any conditions, dedications, exactions imposed as a
condition of approval of development applications place only fair and roughly
proportionate burdens on development, offsetting the burdens that the proposed
development places on public utilities, streets and other services but not
imposing additional burdens on development that the community as a whole should
bear?
      (10)   Does the action discriminate against property owners, imposing
restrictions or burdens on one property owner that other similarly situated
property owners do not bear?
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004)
§ 35.004 ANALYSIS.
   (A)   If the county determines that a government action involves
constitutional taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed by the
county to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken.
   (B)   In reviewing the proposed action, the following factors may be
analyzed:
      (1)   The affect the potential taking would have on the use or value of
the private property;
      (2)   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional
taking;
      (3)   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the
county’s lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;
      (4)   The cost to the county for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined;
      (5)   The governmental interest involved and its nexus to the potential
taking; and
      (6)   If the action is roughly proportionate or reasonably related to the
impact of any proposed development.
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004)
§ 35.005 APPEALS.
   Any owner of private property whose interest in the property is subject to a
physical or regulatory taking by the county, pursuant to a final and
authoritative decision or action by the county, may appeal the county’s
decision or action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the
grounds for the appeal in the County Clerk/Auditor’s office within 30 days from
the date of the county’s final decision or action. The appeal shall be reviewed
and heard by the Administrative Law Judge pursuant to
Chapter 11 of this code.
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004; Ord. 2023-03, passed 5-16-2023)
§ 35.006 LIMITATIONS.
   The guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and shall not be construed
to expand, nor limit, the scope of the county’s liability for a constitutional
taking. The county shall have no legal liability to any person, firm or entity
of any nature whatsoever and a court may not impose liability upon the county
for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2004-02, passed 6-28-2004)
§ 35.007 LEGAL ACTION.
   A property owner’s failure to appeal the action of the county does not
constitute, and may not be interpreted as constituting, a failure to exhaust
available administrative remedies or as a bar to bringing legal action.

      (4)   Agricultural and gardening operations where i) all reasonable

working order; and iii) such operations do not occur during the restricted
hours;
      (5)   Construction, fabrication, and property maintenance activities

commercial or industrial source of sound may apply to the Planning and Zoning
Administrator (or designee) for an exception in order to provide time to comply
with the maximum sound pressure levels set forth in Table 3 of §
94.005 above. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall have the authority,
consistent with this section, to grant an exception, not to exceed 365 days
from the date of such application unless extended by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator for good cause.
      (2)   Any person seeking an exception in time to comply shall file an
application with the Planning and Zoning Administrator. The application shall
contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or
activity for which the exception is sought into compliance with this chapter
prior to the date requested in the application would constitute an unreasonable
hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. The applicant
shall mail notice of the application for an exception in time to all neighbors
within 100 feet of the source of the sound and shall file an affidavit of
mailing with the Planning and Zoning Administrator. Any individual who claims
to be adversely affected by allowance of the exception in time to comply may

hearing may be held.
      (3)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the
Planning and Zoning Administrator shall balance the hardship to the applicant,
the community, and other persons of not granting the exception in time to
comply, against the adverse impact on health, safety, and welfare of persons
affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse
impacts of granting the exception. Applicants for exceptions in time to comply
and persons contesting exceptions may be required to submit any information the
Planning and Zoning Administrator may reasonably require. In granting or
denying an application, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall place on
public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the
exception in time to comply including a statement that the need for the
extension or modification clearly outweighs any adverse impacts of granting the
extension or modification.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Administrator may grant or deny the
application. If the application is granted, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator may impose conditions, including a schedule for achieving
compliance. Noncompliance with any condition of the exception shall terminate
the exception and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this
chapter for which the exception was granted.
      (5)   Appeals of an adverse decision of the Planning and Zoning
Administrator shall be made to the Planning and Zoning. Review by the Planning
and Zoning shall be limited to whether the decision is supported by substantial
evidence.

   (C)   Variances.
      (1)   A variance from specific requirements of this chapter may only
(emphasis added) be granted by the Subdivision Administrator acting as the land
use authority or the Planning Commission acting as the appeal authority upon

purpose of the land use ordinances;
         (b)   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
         (c)   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a

variance is sought; and
         (b)   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
      (3)   In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance
would cause unreasonable hardship under division (C)(2)(a) above, land use
authority or appeal authority may not find an unreasonable hardship if the
hardship is self-imposed or economic.
      (4)   In determining whether or not there are special circumstances
attached to the property, land use authority or appeal authority may find that
special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances:
         (a)   Relate to the hardship complained of; and
         (b)   Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties
in the same zone.
      (5)   Pursuant to state law, variances run with the land.
      (6)   (a)   An application for a variance from one or more of the
requirements of this chapter shall be made to the Subdivision Administrator in
the form of a letter. The letter shall include the basis for the variance
request and the nature of the hardship that would result if the variance is not
approved.
         (b)   The Subdivision Administrator shall evaluate the application
using the criteria of division (C)(6)(a) above and shall approve or deny the
request.
         (c)   If the Subdivision Administrator determines that the variance
shall be denied, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning
Commission acting as the appeal authority who shall uphold or overturn the
Subdivision Administrator’s decision.
            1.   The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the
conditions justifying a variance have been met.
            2.   The appeal authority may not grant a use variance.
            3.   In granting a variance, the appeal authority may impose
additional requirements on the applicant that will:
               a.   Mitigate any harmful affects of the variance; or
               b.   Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is
waived or modified.
         (d)   The preliminary or final plat application which includes or is
the subject of a variance request shall not be scheduled for consideration by
the Board of County Commissioners until all variance requests have been either
approved or denied by the Subdivision Administrator and/or the Planning
Commission.

Administrator’s interpretation of the language of this chapter or his or her

(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.037 FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   The final plat is the last stage in the subdivision approval
process. At this stage, the subdivider is responsible for delineation and
dedication of all public rights-of-way and easements, dedication of other
public lands, if required, and final lot and block configuration. In addition,
all public improvements associated with the subdivision are identified and
quantified, and the subdivider is required to enter into a subdivision
improvements agreement with the county which guarantees that the appropriate
improvement costs are borne by the subdivider.
      (2)   No request for final plat approval shall be considered by the Board
of County Commissioners until the preliminary plat has been approved by the
Planning Commission and all conditions of approval set forth in the resolution
approving the preliminary plat have been satisfied. The final plat approval
process shall not be used to amend or revise the approved preliminary plat or
the conditions of approval of the preliminary plat. Any revisions or amendments
to the preliminary plat, or to the conditions, must be approved by the Planning
Commission by an amendment to the preliminary plat prior to the Board of County
Commissioners hearing of the final plat.

§§
152.050 through
152.065 of this chapter;
         (f)   In the event the proposed subdivision is within one and one-half

special service district, or municipal expansion area, the applicant shall
provide written comments from the affected entity; and
         (g)   A copy of all restrictive covenants on the property which shall
be recorded with the County Recorder with the final plat. The covenants shall
indicate that the county has no responsibility for enforcing the covenants, but
will be the responsibility of the subdivider or subsequent lot purchasers to
enforce these covenants.
   (C)   Process.
      (1)   The Subdivision Administrator shall review the application for
final plat approval to determine whether it is consistent with the approved
preliminary plat and with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   If the Subdivision Administrator determines that the final plat
application is not in compliance with the approved preliminary plat, or with
the requirements of this chapter, the Subdivision Administrator will provide
the subdivider a list of the deficiencies and other information to assist in
the correction of the application.
      (3)   Upon a determination that the application for final plat is
complete and consistent with the approved preliminary plat and the requirements
of this chapter, the Subdivision Administrator shall schedule the final plat to
be presented to the Board of County Commissioners for acceptance.
      (4)   The subdivider must be familiar with the minimum county road
standards as outlined in §
152.052(B) of this chapter.
         (a)   If the intent of the subdivider is to build roads within the
subdivision that will be accepted and maintained by the county after
dedication, such roads must be built consistent with the county road standards.
To ensure that this happens, the subdivider must meet with a representative of
the county’s Road Department.
         (b)   Before proceeding on any road work, placement of any underground
utilities and/or acquisition of any road materials, the subdivider must provide
the county’s Road Department with a copy of the preliminary plat and set up an
on-site meeting with the county’s Road Department representative to review all
aspects of the roads within the subdivision. If the subdivider intends that the
roads within the subdivision shall be private roads and thus not required to be
constructed to county standards, the subdivider may be required to obtain the
approval of the county’s Road Department for all subdivision access roads that
originate off of County roads and other safety factors such as placement of
signs and other items. The subdivider may be required, at his or her own
expense, to provide testing for road materials, compaction testing and other
testing procedures will be used to assure compliance with minimum standards.
The subdivider will develop a schedule of work to be accomplished with an
inspection schedule.
         (c)   If the subdivider proceeds with any of the work outlined herein
without the approval and/or inspection of the county’s Road Department
representative, the county will not accept these roads onto the county system
nor be responsible for any type of maintenance duty. This would include, but
not be limited to, the placement of any type of water, sewer, septic,
telephone, cable television, fire hydrant and the like lines that will be
within the right-of-way of any public roads. If such lines are intended to be
placed within the right-of-way of any public roads, substantial compliance will
be required and the subdivider will required to either provide adequate
certification of such compaction or compensate the county for inspecting such
for compliance.
         (d)   After all requirements have been met and inspections completed a
letter will be sent to the subdivider stating the acceptance of the roads by
the county (never been done).
   (D)   Actions required prior to recording the final plat.
      (1)   The surveyor making the plat shall certify that the surveyor:
         (a)   Holds a license in accordance with the state’s Professional
Engineers and Land Surveyors Licensing Act;
         (b)   Has completed a survey of the property described on the plat in
accordance with state law and has verified all measurements;
         (c)   Has resolved any and all boundary issues with adjoining
properties to said subdivision; and
         (d)   Has placed monuments as represented on the plat.
      (2)   No plat shall be recorded until it has been:
         (a)   Approved by the Board of County Commissioners;
         (b)   A signature Mylar has been prepared with all revisions, signed
by the land owner(s) and the surveyor with signatures notarized, surveyors seal
and registration number, signature of the Chair of the Board of County
Commissioners and attested by the County Clerk/Auditor;
         (c)   An approved subdivision improvements agreement has been executed
and filed with the County Clerk/Auditor; and
         (d)   The final plat Mylar has been approved as to form and signed by
all necessary parties such as the County Planning Commission representative,
the County Health Department representative, the County Attorney’s office and
the like.

§ 152.038 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS; ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   (A)   A minor subdivision of four or less lots is permitted and is exempted
from the platting process found in this chapter and may be processed and
approved by staff with the presentment of a record of survey to be filed in the
Surveyor’s office by a licensed surveyor and upon providing evidence of legal
and utility access to the lot that complies with the minimum road standards as
outlined in this chapter.
   (B)   Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any minor subdivision
lot, the following shall be provided to the county: a site plan showing the
location of the improvement in relation to the lot lines to ensure that the
setbacks and other requirements as outlined in this chapter are met.
(Ord. 2019-04, passed 11-19-2019)
§ 152.039 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   In order to ensure that the required county roads and, if
specified, other public facilities including drainage and water and sanitary
sewer facilities are constructed in accordance with the county road standards,
acceptable drainage facility standards and the standards of the agency
providing public and water and sanitary sewer service and to ensure that the
cost of the required public improvements are borne by the subdivider and not
the public, the subdivider will be required to enter into a subdivision
improvement agreement with the county.
      (2)   The agreement shall be found acceptable to the county and signed by
the applicant prior to the approval of the final plat by the Board of County
Commissioners.
      (3)   No final plat shall be approved by the Board of County
Commissioners until an approved subdivision improvement agreement has been
executed.
   (B)   Form and content.
      (1)   The subdivision improvement agreement shall be structured as
proscribed by the Board of County Commissioners.
      (2)   The subdivision improvement agreement shall, at a minimum, describe
the public improvements to be provided by the subdivider and include unit and
total costs, the form of collateral to be provided for the public improvements
and the basis for forfeiture of the collateral and assumption of responsibility
by the county.
   (C)   Collateral required to guarantee improvements.
      (1)   The Board of County Commissioners shall require that sufficient
collateral be provided by the subdivider to cover the cost of the public
improvements required by the subdivision improvement agreement and insure the
completion of such improvements within the time period specified. The amount of
collateral shall be 125% of the estimated cost of the county roads as prepared
by the county’s Road Department. If requested by the agency responsible for the
provision of public water and/or sanitary sewer service, the Board of County
Commissioners shall also require collateral for water and sanitary sewer
improvements. Collateral may also be required for drainage facilities and other
improvements. The collateral shall be in the form of an escrow deposit,
performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or in special circumstances, a
first lien and restriction on sale of the property to be subdivided. The first
lien and restriction on sale of the property shall only be used when the
appraised market value of the property is equal to, or greater than, the
estimated cost of the public improvements. The Board of County Commissioners
may accept one, or a combination, of the types of collateral listed above.
      (2)   As improvements are completed, the subdivider may apply to the
Board of County Commissioners for release of all or part of the collateral.
Upon certification by the County Road Department that the county road
improvements have been completed and are in conformance with county standards,
the Board of County Commissioners shall authorize the release of part or all of
the collateral; except that, the Board may retain 10% of the collateral for a
specified period of time in order to ensure that the improvement s have been
properly constructed.
      (3)   In the event that the water and sewer facilities have been included
in the subdivision improvement agreement and collateralized, the Board of
County Commissioners shall authorize the release of the water and sewer
collateral upon notification by the providing entity that the improvements have
been completed.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.050 COMPLIANCE.
   All subdivisions must comply with the following standards.
   (A)   Insofar as possible, the natural terrain, existing topography and
natural vegetation shall be preserved.
   (B)   Where the property to be subdivided is subject to natural or human-
made hazards such as flooding, rock and mud slides, open quarries or abandoned
mines, or where there exists shallow water table conditions or polluted water
sources, such hazards or conditions shall be identified and the subdivider
shall provide stamped engineered documentation as to how the hazards or
conditions have been eliminated, or will be eliminated, through the design and
construction of the subdivision.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.051 LOTS.
   All lots within the subdivision shall conform to the following standards.
   (A)   Lots shall meet the width, depth, frontage and lot size requirements
for the zoning district in which the subdivision is located, as specified in §
152.065 of this chapter.
   (B)   All lots shall abut a dedicated street or county road, or a street or
road that has become public by right of use, or a private street for which
there is a (recorded) maintenance agreement.
   (C)   No single lot shall be transected by a municipal or county boundary
line or by a special service area or special service district boundary, a
public road or street or a private road or street which can legally be used by
property owners other than the owner of the lot.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.052 PUBLIC STREETS.
   (A)   (1)   All streets or other right-of-way designated for public
vehicular use and county maintenance shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the adopted road standards of the county, including adequate
and required street or highway signs, cattle guards and other necessary items,
which are incorporated into this chapter as division (B) below. Maps and plats,
when properly made, acknowledged, filed and recorded according to the
procedures specified, operate as a dedication of all streets and other public
places and vest the fee of those parcels of land in the county for the public
for the uses named or intended in those maps or plats. However, mere dedication
of streets does not trigger the county’s duty to maintain such roads until they
have been constructed or improved to the above mentioned county road standards.
      (2)   If, due to the size of a development, a turn lane is required to
access a public street or streets to be used in the development, the county
shall require the subdivider to obtain and produce for county review a letter
from UDOT stating such.
   (B)   (1)   Street types.
         (a)   Residential streets. Streets which primary function is to
provide access to individual lots within the subdivision. This would include
all streets, except the ones designated as collector streets.
         (b)   Collector streets. The main streets in the subdivision. This
would usually be the street that enters or exits the subdivision which serves
as a collector of all the residential streets.
      (2)   Street widths.
         (a)   Unless deemed otherwise by the county’s Road Department,
residential streets shall have a minimum right-of-way of 50 feet. The minimum
surface width for gravel shall be 26 feet. The minimum surface width for
pavement shall be 24 feet. Gravel streets in Spanish Valley are not permitted
and must be paved.
         (b)   Collector streets shall have a minimum right of way of 60 feet.
The minimum width for gravel shall be 32 feet. The minimum surface width for
pavement shall be 30 feet.
      (3)   Street design standards.
         (a)   Width requirement. Before any street is accepted by the county
for maintenance, the street must be constructed to the width requirement. A
minimum of nine-inch compacted depth of base material must be placed on the
street. Of this base material, the surface must consist of a minimum of three
inches of one inch or three-quarter inch crushed gravel. This material must be
accepted by the county’s Road Department and, if deemed necessary, testing of
the material and compaction may be required by the engineer. If such testing is
required, this shall be done at the expense of the subdivider.
         (b)   Asphalt surfaces. If the street is constructed to an asphalt
surface, the surface depth must be a minimum of three inches to be accepted for
maintenance by the county. Asphalt and compaction must be accepted by the
county’s Road Department and, if deemed necessary, testing of the material and
compaction may be required by the engineer. If such testing is required, this
shall be done at the expense of the subdivider. All newly constructed
subdivision roads in Spanish Valley shall have an asphalt surface.
         (c)   Minimum grade. Unless deemed otherwise by the county’s Road
Department, the minimum grade for all streets shall be 0.5%. The maximum grade
allowed for residential streets is 8% and for collector streets is 6%. Where
the observance of this requirement is unfeasible, an exception may be granted.
Streets should be leveled, when possible, to a grade of less than 4% for a
distance of at least 50 feet approaching all intersections.
         (d)   Intersecting right angles. Whenever possible, streets shall
intersect at right angles. When streets meet at acute angles, a reasonable
radius will be required.
         (e)   Dead end streets. Dead end streets will have a turn-around (cul-
de-sac) with a minimum radius of 50 feet. Dead end streets should not exceed
500 feet in length if possible.
         (f)   Intersections. No more than four streets shall enter an
intersection.
         (g)   Vertical curves. Vertical curves shall be used at all changes of
grade exceeding 1%. Horizontal curves shall be required if street lines deflect
more than five degrees. The minimum centerline radius for residential streets
shall be 150 feet. Collector streets shall be 300 feet.
         (h)   Curb and gutter. The minimum widths of streets which have curb
and gutter shall be 40 feet on residential streets and 50 feet for collector
streets. All measurements are from the back of the curb to the back of the
curb.
         (i)   Cattle guards. Any cattle guards required or installed shall be
in compliance with the county’s Cattle Guard Policy and shall be of a width and
construction approved by the county’s Road Department.
         (j)   Signs. The subdivider shall provide and install any required
signs on roads or streets as required by the Manual of Uniform Traffic-Control
Devices and by the county’s Road Department.
         (k)   Gates. No gates, whether locked or unlocked, shall be allowed on
any roads or streets accepted by the county.
         (l)   Public streets. All roads or streets accepted by the county are
considered public roads and access by the public cannot be limited by the
subdivider or future owners of any of the lots within the subdivision.
         (m)   Drainage/curb and gutter. In the absence of curb and gutter, the
subdivider shall provide a street drainage plan detailing potential impacts to
county roads and streets. The subdivider shall be required to provide and
install culverts or other drainage structures as required by the county.
         (n)   New streets. When a subdivision is considered to be high
density. The county may require the subdivider to pave the road with a minimum
of a two lift armor coat consisting of one lift using a three-quarter inch
dirty gravel chip and the second lift using a one-half inch clean gravel chip;
or as determined by the county a compacted asphalt mat consisting of a minimum
two-inch depth when fully compacted may be required.
         (o)   Existing streets. The county may consider on a case by case
basis the upgrading of officially accepted roads that meet the county standards
in high density subdivisions with at least ten or more lots, or when conditions
in the subdivision may cause safety or health related issues.
      (4)   Easements.
         (a)   Easements for utilities such as poles, wires, conduits, gas
lines, water lines and the like shall be located at the rear of all lots,
whenever possible. The width shall be a minimum of 15 feet, which can be
divided between adjoining lots.
         (b)   If front line easements are required, a minimum of 15 feet shall
be allocated. All easements shall be designed so as to provide efficient
installation of utilities.
         (c)   If front line easements are required and are within the right-
of-way of any road or street, sufficient and proper compaction of any
underground lines shall be required. Testing of compaction shall be at the
expense of the subdivider.
         (d)   All utilities shall be provided in compliance with all of the
required building codes covering such installation.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.053 PRIVATE ROADS.
   The county does not intend to dictate a specific standard of construction to
a subdivider for a private road; except that, the standard must allow reliable
vehicular access for emergency, delivery of goods and services and the
installation and service of utilities. Again, as previously stated above, a
dedication of a private road does not trigger the county’s duty to maintain
such a road until it has been constructed or improved to the county road
standards.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.054 SIDEWALKS AND PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS.
   When, in the opinion of the county’s Road Department, the projected traffic
volumes within the subdivision are such that the separation of vehicular and
pedestrian access is necessary for the safety of the public, the County
Commissioners may require designed sidewalks or pedestrian rights-of-way.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.055 SANITARY SEWAGE.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided below, each lot in the subdivision shall
be served with an approved piped sanitary sewer system.
   (B)   Individual septic tank systems, or other private sewage systems, shall
only be permitted when the nearest point of the subdivision boundary is more
than 1,320 feet from an existing approved sanitary sewer system. Septic systems
shall be in conformance with the requirements established by the state’s
Division of Environmental Health and the county’s Health Department.
(Ord. passed 4- -2016)
§ 152.056 WATER SUPPLY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided below, each lot in the subdivision shall

possible. County staff shall post a notice of Board vacancies, including mid-
term vacancies, in a local newspaper of record.
   (D)   Candidate interest. In early November of each year, the County
Administrator shall cause notice of appointment(s) to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county. The Planning and Zoning
Department shall be responsible for the costs of such advertisement. Such
notice shall state the nature and term of the appointment(s), the qualification
for such appointment, request written statements of interest and
qualifications, and establish a deadline for submittal of such statements,

necessitate.
   (F)   Candidate interviews. Upon availability, a member of the County Board
of Commissioners, a Planning Commission member who is not also a candidate,
county zoning staff, County Attorney and County Administrator may interview
qualified candidates and provide a recommendation to the Board of County
Commissioners. At the start of each interview, candidates will be given three
to five minutes to briefly introduce themselves and to provide relevant
information as to background and experience. During the interview process, the
committee are encouraged to ask questions which verify a candidate’s land use
knowledge, experience, eligibility and availability to meet the requirements of
service. The committee shall ask the same questions of each candidate. After
responding to those questions, Commissioners may ask the applicant additional
clarifying questions if necessary based on the responses the applicant has
given.
   (G)   Voting.
      (1)   The committee shall vote upon the names of candidates in
alphabetical order. Each committee member shall be entitled to one vote for
each vacancy. Committee members shall vote by voice or a raise of hands. If
requested by the Chair, written ballots may be used for voting purposes.
      (2)   Staff will tally the number of votes cast for each candidate and
read this information back to the committee. The committee, by motion will
forward this recommendation, including any findings, to the Board of County
Commissioners for consideration.
   (H)   Recommendations to the Board of County Commissioners.

for streets both public and private including standards for street intersection
markers (signs).
   BASELINE STREET. East and west directional street (ex: Center Street in
Monticello) that intersects with the meridian street (ex: Main Street in

(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.003 DUTIES OF ADDRESSING AGENCY AND ADDRESSING AUTHORITY.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the addressing agency to establish an
addressing standards and definitions policy for the County.
   (B)   The addressing agency shall have a duty to offer addressing guidance,
as requested, from incorporated cities. They must also approve alphabetical
street names and create and maintain address point data for the whole county by
creating a positive relationship with the cities in San Juan County. The agency
is responsible for maintaining address points through data documented and/or
validated by the incorporated cities, including creating new addresses,
updating existing addresses, and making changes to data associated with
individual addresses.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the addressing authority to name and number
all streets, to designate numbers for houses or buildings fronting upon all
such streets, to certify addresses in accordance with the addressing standards
and definitions policy, and to enforce the provisions of this chapter, for the
unincorporated area of the county as well as contract municipalities. The
addressing authority shall inform the county addressing agency before making
addressing changes in the unincorporated county.
   (D)   The addressing agency shall establish and make changes as necessary to
the baseline/meridian streets and boundaries for the individual regions that
make up the regional grid system.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.004 NAMES OF STREETS DESIGNATED IN THE OFFICIAL STREET AND ADDRESS FILES.
   All streets, whether public or private, shall be known by the names by which
they are so designated in the official street and address files of the
addressing agency, with such additions, changes, and corrections of the names
as shall from time to time be placed in the official files by ordinance.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.005 SYSTEM OF NUMBERING.
   The addressing authority in numbering the houses or buildings upon the
streets of unincorporated San Juan County or contract municipalities shall
adhere to the following address format:
   (A)   The initial point of intersection in any regional address grid shall
be the junction of a Baseline Street and Meridian Street axis, and the
numbering shall extend thence east, west, north, and south; the even numbers
always on the right and odd numbers on the left, looking away from the initial
point.
   (B)   Each property identification number must contain:
      (1)   An "address number" component that is numerically sequenced and
assigned to a structure or parcel along a street according to its relative
distance perpendicular to a baseline or meridian axis of a regional address
grid.
      (2)   A "direction component" referencing the regional address grid
quadrant and the compass
in which the address numbers run shall be required whenever a street number is
used in an address, abbreviated with the single letter equivalent for its
compass direction (N, S, E, or W).
         (a)   A prefix directional component is not required on streets with
an alphabetic name in
instances where the direction of travel away from the initial point of
intersection is deemed by the addressing agency to be too inconsistent or would
otherwise be confusing to assign as a singular compass direction. However, in
any regional address grid, a directional component should be included in the
official street and address files, regardless of whether or not the directional
is used as part of an assigned address.
         (b)   A suffix directional component is an optional component to be
included after the street
type that indicates the compass direction taken by the thoroughfare from an
arbitrary starting point - or the sector where it is located.
      (3)   A "street name component" consisting of either an alphabetic name
or a number name, but not both is assigned to both public and private rights-
of-way for locating purposes.
         (a)   Alphabetically named streets.
            1.   Alphabetic names should only contain letters of the alphabet,
without special characters, numerical characters, or hyphens as part of their
name.
            2.   Words that serve as a street type shall not be allowed to
serve as street names or parts of street names. Refer to the definition of
"street type" under section 155.002 of this chapter for a list of street types.
            3.   Alphabetic street names should never be abbreviated.
            4.   Street names shall not be duplicated by exact name, exact
sound, similar name, or similar sound with any other existing or proposed
street names within a regional addressing grid or
singular zip code.
            5.   Street names with unconventional spelling, difficult spelling,
or any combination of the two shall not be used, preferring commonly accepted
spellings on all street names instead.
            6.   A compass directional shall not be used as, or as part of, any
street name.
            7.   No street name shall exceed the number of characters that can
comfortably fit on a street sign. Generally no more than two words not
exceeding 13 characters including spaces but not including the street.
         (b)   Numbered streets.
            1.   Numerically designated based on their location within the
regional address grid relative to either the baseline or meridian axis streets.
            2.   Street numbers shall never contain alphanumeric characters.
            3.   A directional component is required for all addresses
containing a street number to correspond with its orientation on the grid.
      (4)   A "street type component" that modifies the name to distinguish
specific locational, functional, and physical characteristics of the street to
which an address is assigned. Refer to the San Juan County Addressing Policy
for a list of street type definitions. Street types should be abbreviated
following the USPS street type standards.
   (C)   A property identification number may also contain one or more of the
following:
         (1)   A "unit locator component" is a component used to identify a
one-to-one correspondence between a building and high-density occupancy
structures within the building, such as suites, rooms, apartments, and
condominium units. This code is always preceded with a "#" sign instead of
using the word suite, unit, apt., or any other identifier when issued in
standardized address format.
         (2)   A "plus code component" is an alphanumeric component most
commonly in the form XXXX+XX based on latitude and longitude to completely
remove uncertainty as to the location of a parcel or structure, typically
included in areas of remote development from which locating an address may not
be clear using ordinary methods.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.006 DISPLAY OF PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.
   When a property identification number has been designated by the addressing
authority, the owner or occupant of such house or building shall cause a
painted, carved, or cast duplicate of such number at least three inches in
height and varying in size according to the setback distance of the structure,
and of a shade contrasting with the background upon which the number is
mounted, to be located on the structure as provided in this chapter. Such
number(s) shall be block numerals (not script) and shall be located in a
conspicuous position upon the portion of such structure which faces the street.
If such structure is concealed from the street upon which it is located, the
owner or occupant shall cause an additional duplicate of such number at a
location visible from the street indicating the true location of the structure.
The property identification number shall be mounted in a permanent, stationary,
and durable manner - unobstructed at all times by vines, screens, or anything
that would tend to hide or obscure the number, and at a sufficient height that
the number will be clearly perceptible with the unaided eye from the centerline
of the street upon which the structure is located.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.007 PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION APPROVAL IS REQUIRED FOR FINAL PLAT APPROVAL.
   Property identification approval must be given by the addressing authority
prior to final approval of a subdivision. The property identification approval
must appear on the final plat of a subdivision, PUD, condominium, or other
proposed development prior to final approval and upon amendment. The developer
shall pay for and arrange to manufacture and install all street identification
signs as required by the addressing authority.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.008 STREET IDENTIFICATION CHANGE.
   (A)   Upon application from seventy-five percent of the owners of structures
located upon a street for a change in street name identification, and upon
payment of a fee set by the addressing agency and approved by the board of
county commissioners, the addressing agency may grant a street name change. If
the request is granted, the applicant shall pay the cost of changing signage.
The addressing agency shall change the official street file.
   (B)   If, in the opinion of the addressing agency, the requested change of
street name serves a legitimate public interest, the addressing agency may
waive payment of the fee.
(Ord. 2024-05, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 155.009 STREET IDENTIFICATION CHANGE ORIGINATED BY THE COUNTY, CONTRACT
ENTITY, CONTRACT MUNICIPALITY, OR ADDRESSING AUTHORITY.

have structures on the proposed for a name change, by mailing to the county-
recorded property owner address.
      (2)   If the property owners who own lots with structures on a street
proposed for a name change desire to participate in renaming the street, they
may sign a petition agreeing and proposing a new street name. The new name
petition must contain at least seventy-five percent of the signatures of
recorded property owners with structures and must be completed within 30 days
after notification of the proposed name change by the addressing authority.
      (3)   If property owners do not provide a petition agreeing on a new
street name, the name change shall be based on the recommendation from the
