2-1A-1: PURPOSE:
Growth and development activity in the city has created an additional demand
and need for roadway facilities, publicly owned parks, open space and
recreational facilities, and police and fire facilities. Persons responsible
for growth and development activity should pay a proportionate share of the
cost of such planned facilities needed to serve the growth and development
activity. Impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the
costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in comparison to the
benefits already received and yet to be received. Pursuant to Utah Code
Annotated title 11, chapter 36a, this chapter regulates impact fees for planned
facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in
order to carry out the purposes of the impact fee program. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-
2006; amd. 2013 Code)

(Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-3: APPLICABILITY:
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all new development activity in
the city unless otherwise provided herein. Until any impact fee required by
this article has been paid in full, no building permit for any development
activity shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development
activity for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. (Ord.
194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-4: SERVICE AREAS:
The service area for all impact fees shall be all of the incorporated area of
the city, including future annexed areas. The city council, as part of the
impact fee revision process, shall review the appropriateness of the boundary
designation of the service area periodically. Following such review and a
public hearing, the service area may be amended. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-5: CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES:
Calculation of impact fees shall be established by the impact fee study
prepared by Jones And Associates. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)

17-2006)
2-1A-7: OFFSETS TO IMPACT FEES:
Impact fee offsets (sometimes referred to as credits) are created to recognize
the value of land or improvements that are dedicated to the city. These
dedications provide needed infrastructure that benefits the city as a whole.
The accounts are tracked in dollar increments and can be used to satisfy like
impact fees (e.g., transportation and right of way offsets can be used to
satisfy transportation and right of way impact fees). Offsets against the
impact fee that would otherwise be due for a development activity may be
approved in accordance with the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An offset shall be granted for qualifying improvements that are
required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees
otherwise due for the same category of improvements in the same development.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the city council, offsets
shall not result in reimbursement from the city or constitute a credit against
future fees in subsequent developments, and shall not constitute a liability of
the city for any deficiency in the offset.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of
improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or
his predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same
category for which an impact fee was imposed.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing
and paying for appraisals of land and improvements, construction cost figures,
and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the
computation of the offset claimed. The city council shall not grant offsets to
any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the city may
reasonably require.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised
land value of the parent parcel on the date of transfer of ownership to the
city, as determined by an MAI (Member Appraisal Institute) certified appraiser.
The certified appraiser will be selected from a list of city approved
appraisers provided by the city. The applicant shall pay the costs of the
appraisal and the appraiser shall use generally accepted appraisal techniques.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements
of this section shall be valid from the data of approval until ten (10) years
after the date of approval or until the last date of construction of the
project, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed
only by owners of property within the development area for which the qualifying
improvement was required.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any claim for offsets must be made in writing, not later than the time
of submittal of a building permit application or an application for another
permit subsequent to development approval that is subject to impact fees. Any
claim not so made shall be deemed waived. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-8: DEVELOPER AGREEMENTS FOR QUALIFYING IMPROVEMENT IN LIEU OF IMPACT FEES:
Where a development activity includes or requires a qualifying improvement, the
city council and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer
participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying
improvements in lieu of paying all or part of the impact fees which would
otherwise be due on the development. Such agreement may provide for cash
reimbursements, offsets or other appropriate compensation to the developer for
the developer's participation in the financing or construction of the
qualifying improvements. The agreement shall include:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Estimated Cost: The estimated cost of the qualifying improvements,
using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, or, if no bid is
available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed Utah engineer;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Schedule: A schedule for initiation and completion of the qualifying
improvement;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Design In Compliance: A requirement that the qualifying improvement be
designed and completed in compliance with any applicable city or state laws or
regulations;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Amount: Provisions regarding the amount of impact fees which will be
credited to the developer for participating in the construction of the
qualifying improvement; and
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Other Necessary Conditions: Such other terms and conditions as deemed
necessary by the city council. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-9: CHALLENGES AND APPEALS:

justifying a deduction in the standard impact fee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The facts relied upon by the appealing party with respect to the
fees appealed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any studies and data relied upon by the appealing party;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The amount of the impact fee the appealing party claims should be
paid and the reasons supporting that claim; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any errors made by the city in calculating, assessing or collecting
the impact fee.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Hearing; Decision: Upon receipt of the appeal, the appeal authority
shall thereafter schedule a hearing on the appeal in accordance with title 9,
chapter 5 of this code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â District Court Review: Within thirty (30) days of a decision regarding
an impact fee by the appeal authority, any party to the appeal that is
adversely affected by the appeal authority decision may petition the district
court for review of the decision. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006; amd. 2013 Code)
2-1A-10: COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES:

2-1A-11: FUND ACCOUNTING FOR IMPACT FEES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Separate Account: The city council shall establish a separate interest
bearing accounting fund for each type of planned facility for which an impact
fee is collected. The city shall invest such fees and the yield on such fees,
at the actual rate of return to the city, shall be credited to such accounting
fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the city. Such
funds need not be segregated from other city monies for banking purposes.
Interfund loans may be made between such accounting funds.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Yields: Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are
deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes
specified for such fund.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Records Maintained: The city shall maintain and keep financial records
for each such accounting fund, showing the source and amount of all monies
collected, earned and received by the fund, and each expenditure from such
fund, in accordance with normal city accounting practices, and at the end of
each fiscal year shall prepare a report on each such fund showing such
information. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the
same manner as other financial records of the city.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Time Limit: Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six (6)
years after their receipt, unless the city council identifies, in writing, an
extraordinary and compelling reason to hold the impact fees longer than six (6)
years. Under such circumstances, the city council shall establish an absolute
date by which the impact fees shall be expended. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-12: REFUNDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Scope: If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees as
required, all current owners of the property on which impact fees have been
paid shall receive a pro rata refund of such impact fees. In determining
whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be
considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice: The city shall notify the owner or owners of property for which
such a refund may be made, by first class mail deposited with the United States
postal service, at the last known address of such property owners.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Written Request Required: In order to receive such a refund, the owner
or owners of the subject property must, within twelve (12) months after the
mailing of such notice by the city, make a written request for a refund to the
city council, including a certification that such person is a record owner of
the property and that he or she is entitled to the refund. The city council may
rely on such certification, in the absence of a written certification by
another person asserting that the proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in
doubt as to whom to pay such funds, the city may deposit the funds with an
appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In that event,
the city may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable
costs, including attorney fees, of causing the funds to be deposited with the
court.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Request Not Received: Any impact fees for which no application for a
refund has been made within such one year period shall be retained by the city
and expended on appropriate planned facilities.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Interest Included: Refunds of impact fees under this section shall
include any interest earned.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Termination Of Program: If the city council seeks to terminate any or
all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered impact
fees from any terminated component or components, including interest earned,
shall be refunded pursuant to this section. The city council shall publish a
notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of
general circulation at least two (2) times and shall notify all owners of
property for which a refund may be made by first class mail at the last known
address of such property owners. All funds available for refund shall be
retained for a period of twelve (12) months following the second publication.
At the end of that period, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city,
but must be expended for appropriate planned facilities. This notice
requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances
within the impact fee accounts being terminated.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Developer Refunds: The city shall refund to a developer any impact fees
paid by that developer, plus interest earned on the impact fees, if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The developer does not proceed with the development activity for
which the impact fees were imposed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The developer files with the city council a written request for the
refund not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the
building permit (or any extension thereof) in connection with which the impact
fees were assessed; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The city council determines that no impact has resulted from the
contemplated development activity.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Administrative Fee: The city shall charge an administrative fee for
verifying and computing the refund equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) of
the amount of the refund or the city's actual cost of such verification and
computing. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-13: USE OF FUNDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose Received: Impact fees shall be used solely for the purposes for
which they were received.

including, but not limited to, planning, land acquisition, construction,
engineering, architectural, permitting, financing and administrative expenses,
mitigation costs, capital equipment pertaining to planned facilities, and any
other similar expenses that can be capitalized pursuant to generally accepted
accounting principles.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recoup Investment Costs: Impact fees may also be used to recoup
improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth
and development activity will be served by the previously constructed
improvements or incurred costs.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Studies: Impact fees may be used to recoup the cost of studying,
analyzing and preparing the impact fees.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Debt Service On Bonds: Impact fees may be used to pay debt service on
bonds or similar debt instruments issued to finance planned facilities to the
extent such planned facilities serve the development activity for which the
impact fees were imposed. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-14: SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATION TO OTHER FINANCING METHODS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, impact fees are in addition to any
other requirements, taxes, fees or assessments imposed by the city on
development activity or the issuance of building permits or certificates of
occupancy.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Impact fees are intended to be consistent with the city's general plan,
capital facilities plan, impact fee study, land development ordinances, and
other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to
ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development
activity.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In addition to the use of impact fees, the city may finance qualifying
capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment
districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to
such limitations as may be provided by law. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-2006)
2-1A-15: ADJUSTMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conditions: The city council is authorized, upon a proper showing, to
adjust the standard impact fee at the time the fee is charged:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â To respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases, where, if no
adjustments were made, an inequitable collection of impact fees would result;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â To ensure that the impact fee is imposed fairly and in such a manner
that people in similar situations paid a substantially similar impact fee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Based upon studies and data submitted by the developer that justify
recalculating the amount of the impact fee on a particular lot or development;
or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â To allow credits as approved by the city council for dedication of
land for, improvement to, or new construction of, system improvements provided
by the developer, if the facilities are identified in the capital facilities
plan and are required by the city as a condition of approving the development
activity. As used herein, "system improvements" means:

2-1A-16: INDEPENDENT IMPACT FEE CALCULATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Submission; Review: If a fee payer desires not to have an impact fee
determined in any way other than according to an impact fee enactment set forth
in exhibits attached to the ordinance codified herein, then the fee payer shall
prepare and submit to the city council an independent impact fee calculation
for the development activity. The documentation submitted shall show the basis
upon which the independent impact fee calculation was made. The appropriate
city staff shall review the independent impact fee calculation and provide an
analysis to the city council concerning whether the independent impact fee
calculation should be accepted, rejected or accepted in part. The city council
may adopt, reject or adopt in part the independent impact fee calculation based
on the department's analysis and based on the specific characteristics of the
development activity. The impact fee or alternative impact fee and the
calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee
payer.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fee For Review; Deposit: Any fee payer submitting an independent impact
fee calculation must pay to the city a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the
independent impact fee calculation. The fee shall be an amount equal to the
actual review costs incurred by the city, including the cost of any consultant
services deemed necessary by the city council. The city shall require the fee
payer to post a cash deposit of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) prior to
initiating the review. The city shall refund to the fee payer any portion of
such deposit that exceeds the actual costs of review.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Consideration By City Council: The city council shall consider the
documentation submitted by the fee payer and the analysis prepared by the
appropriate department staff persons, but is not required to accept such
documentation or analysis. The city council may require the fee payer to submit
additional or different documentation for consideration. The city council may
adjust the impact fees on a case by case basis based on the independent impact
fee calculation and the specific characteristics of the development activity.
The impact fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set
forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer. (Ord. 194-06, 10-17-

2-1B-1: PURPOSE:
Growth and development activity in the city has created an additional demand
and need for update to the culinary water capital facilities plan and impact
fee study. Persons responsible for growth and development activity should pay a
proportionate share of the cost of such planned facilities needed to serve the
growth and development activity. Impact fees are necessary to achieve an
equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the
future, in comparison to the benefits already received and yet to be received.
Pursuant to Utah Code Annotated title 11, chapter 36a, this chapter regulates
impact fees for planned facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be
liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the impact fee
program. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007; amd. 2013 Code)

2-1B-3: APPLICABILITY:
The collection of impact fees shall apply to all new development activity in
the city unless otherwise provided herein. Until any impact fee required by
this article has been paid in full, no building permit for any development
activity shall be issued. A stop work order shall be issued on any development
activity for which the applicable impact fee has not been paid in full. (Ord.
198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-4: SERVICE AREAS:
The service area for all impact fees shall be all of the incorporated area of
the city, including future annexed areas. The city council, as part of the
impact fee revision process, shall review the appropriateness of the boundary
designation of the service area periodically. Following such review and a
public hearing, the service area may be amended. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)

2-1B-7: OFFSETS TO IMPACT FEES:
Impact fee offsets (sometimes referred to as credits) are created to recognize
the value of land or improvements that are dedicated to the city. These
dedications provide needed infrastructure that benefits the city as a whole.
The accounts are tracked in dollar increments and can be used to satisfy like
impact fees (e.g., transportation and right of way offsets can be used to
satisfy transportation and right of way impact fees). Offsets against the
impact fee that would otherwise be due for a development activity may be
approved in accordance with the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An offset shall be granted for qualifying improvements that are
required to be made by a developer as a condition of development approval.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Offsets shall be allowable and payable only to offset impact fees
otherwise due for the same category of improvements in the same development.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the city council, offsets
shall not result in reimbursement from the city or constitute a credit against
future fees in subsequent developments, and shall not constitute a liability of
the city for any deficiency in the offset.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Offsets shall be given only for the value of any construction of
improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or
his predecessor in title or interest for qualifying improvements of the same
category for which an impact fee was imposed.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing
and paying for appraisals of land and improvements, construction cost figures,
and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the
computation of the offset claimed. The city council shall not grant offsets to
any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the city may
reasonably require.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised
land value of the parent parcel on the date of transfer of ownership to the
city, as determined by an MAI (Member Appraisal Institute) certified appraiser.
The certified appraiser will be selected from a list of city approved
appraisers provided by the city. The applicant shall pay the costs of the
appraisal and the appraiser shall use generally accepted appraisal techniques.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements
of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until ten (10) years
after the date of approval or until the last date of construction of the
project, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed
only by owners of property within the development area or which the qualifying
improvement was required.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any claim for offsets must be made in writing, not later than the time
of submittal of a building permit application or an application for another
permit subsequent to development approval that is subject to impact fees. Any
claim not so made shall be deemed waived. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-8: DEVELOPER AGREEMENTS FOR QUALIFYING IMPROVEMENT IN LIEU OF IMPACT FEES:
Where a development activity includes or requires a qualifying improvement, the
city council and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer
participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying
improvements in lieu of paying all or part of the impact fees which would
otherwise be due on the development. Such agreement may provide for cash
reimbursements, offsets or other appropriate compensation to the developer for
the developer's participation in the financing or construction of the
qualifying improvements. The agreement shall include:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Estimated Cost: The estimated cost of the qualifying improvements,
using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified bidder, or, if no bid is
available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed Utah engineer;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Schedule: A schedule for initiation and completion of the qualifying
improvement;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Design In Compliance: A requirement that the qualifying improvement be
designed and completed in compliance with any applicable city or state laws or
regulations;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Amount: Provisions regarding the amount of impact fees which will be
credited to the developer for participating in the construction of the
qualifying improvement; and
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Other Necessary Conditions: Such other terms and conditions as deemed
necessary by the city council. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-9: CHALLENGES AND APPEALS:

paid and the reasons supporting that claim; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any errors made by the city in calculating, assessing or collecting
the impact fee.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Hearing; Decision: Upon receipt of the appeal, the appeal authority
shall thereafter schedule a hearing on the appeal in accordance with title 9,
chapter 5 of this code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â District Court Review: Within thirty (30) days of a decision regarding
an impact fee by the appeal authority, any party to the appeal that is
adversely affected by the appeal authority decision may petition the district
court for review of the decision. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007; amd. 2013 Code)

2-1B-11: FUND ACCOUNTING FOR IMPACT FEES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Separate Account: The city council shall establish a separate interest
bearing accounting fund for each type of planned facility for which an impact
fee is collected. The city shall invest such fees and the yield on such fees,
at the actual rate of return to the city, shall be credited to such accounting
fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies of the city. Such
funds need not be segregated from other city monies for banking purposes.
Interfund loans may be made between such accounting funds.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Yields: Any yield on such accounting fund into which the fees are
deposited shall accrue to that fund and shall be used for the purposes
specified for such fund.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Records Maintained: The city shall maintain and keep financial records
for each such accounting fund, showing the source and amount of all monies
collected, earned and received by the fund, and each expenditure from such
fund, in accordance with normal city accounting practices, and at the end of
each fiscal year shall prepare a report on each such fund showing such
information. The records of such fund shall be open to public inspection in the
same manner as other financial records of the city.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Time Limit: Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six (6)
years after their receipt, unless the city council identifies, in writing, an
extraordinary and compelling reason to hold the impact fees longer than six (6)
years. Under such circumstances, the city council shall establish an absolute
date by which the impact fees shall be expended. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-12: REFUNDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Scope: If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees as
required, all current owners of the property on which impact fees have been
paid shall receive a pro rata refund of such impact fees. In determining
whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be
considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice: The city shall notify the owner or owners of property for which
such a refund may be made, by first class mail deposited with the United States
postal service, at the last known address of such property owners.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Written Request Required: In order to receive such a refund, the owner
or owners of the subject property must, within twelve (12) months after the
mailing of such notice by the city, make a written request for a refund to the
city council, including a certification that such person is a record owner of
the property and that he or she is entitled to the refund. The city council may
rely on such certification, in the absence of a written certification by
another person asserting that the proposed payee is not the proper payee. If in
doubt as to whom to pay such funds, the city may deposit the funds with an
appropriate court for disposition as the court may determine. In that event,
the city may deduct from the funds deposited an amount equal to the reasonable
costs, including attorney fees, of causing the funds to be deposited with the
court.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Request Not Received: Any impact fees for which no application for a
refund has been made within such one year period shall be retained by the city
and expended on appropriate planned facilities.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Interest Included: Refunds of impact fees under this section shall
include any interest earned.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Termination Of Program: If the city council seeks to terminate any or
all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered impact
fees from any terminated component or components, including interest earned,
shall be refunded pursuant to this section. The city council shall publish a
notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of
general circulation at least two (2) times and shall notify all owners of
property for which a refund may be made by first class mail at the last known
address of such property owners. All funds available for refund shall be
retained for a period of twelve (12) months following the second publication.
At the end of that period, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city,
but must be expended for appropriate planned facilities. This notice
requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances
within the impact fee accounts being terminated.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Developer Refunds: The city shall refund to a developer any impact fees
paid by that developer, plus interest earned on the impact fees, if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The developer does not proceed with the development activity for
which the impact fees were imposed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The developer files with the city council a written request for the
refund not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the
building permit (or any extension thereof) in connection with which the impact
fees were assessed; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The city council determines that no impact has resulted from the
contemplated development activity.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Administrative Fee: The city shall charge an administrative fee for
verifying and computing the refund equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) of
the amount of the refund or the city's actual cost of such verification and
computing. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-13: USE OF FUNDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose Received: Impact fees shall be used solely for the purposes for

mitigation costs, capital equipment pertaining to planned facilities, and any
other similar expenses that can be capitalized pursuant to generally accepted
accounting principles.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recoup Investment Costs: Impact fees may also be used to recoup
improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth
and development activity will be served by the previously constructed
improvements or incurred costs.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Studies: Impact fees may be used to recoup the cost of studying,
analyzing and preparing the impact fees.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Debt Service On Bonds: Impact fees may be used to pay debt service on
bonds or similar debt instruments issued to finance planned facilities to the
extent such planned facilities serve the development activity for which the

capital facilities plan, impact fee study, land development ordinances, and
other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to
ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development
activity.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In addition to the use of impact fees, the city may finance qualifying
capital improvements through the issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment
districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to
such limitations as may be provided by law. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-2007)
2-1B-15: ADJUSTMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conditions: The city council is authorized, upon a proper showing, to
adjust the standard impact fee at the time the fee is charged:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â To respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases, where, if no
adjustments were made, an inequitable collection of impact fees would result;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â To ensure that the impact fee is imposed fairly and in such a manner
that people in similar situations paid a substantially similar impact fee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Based upon studies and data submitted by the developer that justify
recalculating the amount of the impact fee on a particular lot or development;
or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â To allow credits as approved by the city council for dedication of
land for, improvement to, or new construction of, system improvements provided
by the developer, if the facilities are identified in the capital facilities
plan and are required by the city as a condition of approving the development
activity. As used herein, "system improvements" means:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Existing public facilities that are designed to provide services
to service areas within the community at large; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Future public facilities identified in a capital facilities study
or plan that are intended to provide service to service areas within the
community at large.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Reasons Recorded: If the city council grants an adjustment under this
section, it shall include the reason or reasons justifying the adjustment in
the minutes of the meeting during which the adjustment is approved. (Ord.

determined in any way other than according to an impact fee enactment set forth
in exhibits attached to the ordinance codified herein, then the fee payer shall
prepare and submit to the city council an independent impact fee calculation
for the development activity. The documentation submitted shall show the basis
upon which the independent impact fee calculation was made. The appropriate
city staff shall review the independent impact fee calculation and provide an
analysis to the city council concerning whether the independent impact fee
calculation should be accepted, rejected or accepted in part. The city council
may adopt, reject or adopt in part the independent impact fee calculation based
on the department's analysis and based on the specific characteristics of the
development activity. The impact fee or alternative impact fee and the
calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee
payer.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fee For Review; Deposit: Any fee payer submitting an independent impact
fee calculation must pay to the city a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the
independent impact fee calculation. The fee shall be an amount equal to the
actual review costs incurred by the city, including the cost of any consultant
services deemed necessary by the city council. The city shall require the fee
payer to post a cash deposit of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) prior to
initiating the review. The city shall refund to the fee payer any portion of
such deposit that exceeds the actual costs of review.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Consideration By City Council: The city council shall consider the
documentation submitted by the fee payer and the analysis prepared by the
appropriate department staff persons, but is not required to accept such
documentation or analysis. The city council may require the fee payer to submit
additional or different documentation for consideration. The city council may
adjust the impact fees on a case by case basis based on the independent impact
fee calculation and the specific characteristics of the development activity.
The impact fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set
forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer. (Ord. 198.5-07, 8-21-

employ all necessary assistance to cause such objectionable objects or
conditions to be removed or destroyed. The cost accrued by the City, including

registered mail addressed to the last known address of the property owner,
occupant, or persons having interest in the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Failure to Make Payment: In the event the owner, occupant, or
persons having an interest in the property fails to make payment of the amount

considered wetlands or in a pristine state and contributing to the habitat of
non-injurious animals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the inspector determines that the large size of the property
makes the cutting of all weeds impractical, the inspector may issue an order
limiting the required cutting of weeds to a firebreak of not less than fifteen
feet (15') in width around any structures and around the complete perimeter of
the property. In determining an exception, the inspector will consider the size

problem.

such vehicle/vessel for a period of six (6) months. A total of four (4)
extensions may be obtained, provided the requirements as stated hereinafter are
met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Each such permit or extension shall be obtained from the department
after giving proof of ownership and filling out an application on a form to be
provided which gives sufficient information to readily identify the vehicle/
vessel and property in question and paying a fee as established by resolution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Extensions may be obtained by meeting the terms of subsection B1 of

understanding of the circumstances and agreement with the extension signed by
at least seventy five percent (75%) of the owners or occupants of property
within five hundred feet (500') of the applicantâs property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Each such vehicle/vessel shall remain covered by a view obstructing
tarp or similar cover at all times, except when actual restoration or repair
work is in progress.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In the event any part of the vehicle/vessel is raised off the ground
other than by wheels/trailer firmly attached to the vehicle/vessel, it shall be
supported in such a manner as to assure it cannot be readily dislodged or fall
from such support.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A copy of the permit shall be kept with the vehicle/vessel at all
times and shall be shown to the inspector upon demand.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6. Â Â Â Failure to comply with the terms of this subsection shall void the
permit and cause the vehicle/vessel to be declared a nuisance and subject to
the penalty and abatement provisions of this chapter.

is done, diligent effort shall be made to contact the owner or occupant of the
property affected and demand that said conditions be abated within twenty-four
(24) hours. If contact is made and the condition is not abated within the

instituted.

to any or all penalties and remedies as provided in this chapter.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Declaration Of Finding And Intent:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Findings Regarding Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of
way within the city:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well
being of the city and its citizens; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination
basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability
for municipal, educational and community services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm
that may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Protects the police powers and right of way management authority
of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the city infrastructure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Protects the public investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") (PL no. 104-104).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts this

7-2-3: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Nonexclusive Franchise: The city is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and
maintenance of systems in the city rights of way, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal
or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunication systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunication
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the city property. This subsection shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by federal or state
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall
request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the
effective date hereof. If such request is made, the provider may continue
providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not
made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider
shall comply with the provisions of subsection 7-2-9D of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city, upon the written request of the city,
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 120-98, 2-10-1998)
7-2-4: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following
obligations: (Ord. 120-98, 2-10-1998)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, a
nonrefundable application fee in such amount as established by resolution of
the city council. (Ord. 120-98, 2-10-1998; amd. 2013 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date (see franchise agreement). The franchise fee is offset by
any business license fee or business license tax enacted by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in chapter 3 of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Fee Statement And Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
public works department to provide space on city owned poles shall be borne by
the provider.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually, unless otherwise required by the taxing authority.
Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in
this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation;
provided, that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 120-98, 2-10-
1998)

that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair
and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified
by the city, any municipal structure or any other rights of way of the city

other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local requirements, including, but not
limited to, the national electrical safety code.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the city, an imminent danger exists, any rights of way
within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system, may be repaired by
the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights of way intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof.

in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights of way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. (Ord. 120-98, 2-10-1998)

franchise.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Oversight: The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Maintain Records: A provider shall at all times maintain:

management act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access
to perform their duties on behalf of the city; provided, that a provider
notifies the city of and clearly labels the information which a provider deems

shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the
city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records; provided, that the city shall not audit
the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable cost of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city may accept
any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the city

conflict with such law, the provision in question shall return to full force
and effect and shall again be binding on the city and the provider; provided,
that the city shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of
time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a
rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance
with such provision.

person regarding any condition that may result in a removal or relocation of
facilities in the public way to consider possible avoidance or minimization of
removal or relocation requirements and provide the directive as far enough in
advance of the required removal or relocation to allow the person a reasonable
opportunity to plan and minimize cost associated with the required removal or
relocation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â This obligation does not apply to facilities or structures originally
located on private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was

city conducts a test on a meter and the test shows that the meter is within the
range of ninety seven percent (97%) to one hundred three percent (103%)
accuracy, the meter shall be deemed to accurately measure the use of water and
the customer shall pay the costs of the test.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the meter is found to be outside the city's acceptable range of
accuracy, the city shall make whatever repairs are necessary to bring the meter

city property caused by any act or negligence of the customer, his/her family
members, his/her visitors or invitees shall be repaired at the customer's
expense. In emergency situations or if the customer fails or refuses to make
the repairs within a reasonable time, the city may make the repairs and bill
the customer. Failure to pay the bill within a reasonable time shall be grounds
for turning off water service to the customer. Without waiving the right to
turn off water service, the city may also commence legal action to recover the
costs of repair from the customer. In any such legal action, the city shall be
entitled to receive its costs, including reasonable attorney fees.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Unobstructed Access To Meters: Customers are responsible to provide
unobstructed access to water meters by keeping the meter and the area
immediately surrounding it clear of all debris, shrubbery, grass, rocks and
other obstructions. Customers also shall not park or store cars, trucks,
trailers or other objects over, around or on the meter. (Ord. 168-03, 11-11-

8-4B-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this article is to prevent the discharge of sediment and other
construction related pollutants from construction sites. Sediment and debris
from construction sites are a major source of pollution to waterways and water
systems located within the city and surrounding areas. Each year stormwater
runoff carries tons of sediment from construction sites into local drainage
systems, irrigation systems, canals, rivers and lakes. Sediment from stormwater
runoff also clogs and obstructs storm drains, culverts and canals and causes
damage to private property, wildlife habitat and water quality. (Ord. 169-03,
12-2-2003)
8-4B-2: COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW:
Nothing contained in this article is intended to relieve any person or entity
from any obligation to comply with applicable federal and state laws and
regulations pertaining to clean water and/or stormwater runoff. (Ord. 169-03,
12-2-2003)
8-4B-3: PERMIT REQUIRED:
A city stormwater connection and activity application and permit (permit) is
required before any person or entity may excavate, grub and clear, grade, or
perform any type of construction activity that will disrupt or cause a change
in the natural landscape upon any of the following types of property located
within the city:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â One Acre Or More: Any parcel, lot or land development which is equal to
or greater than one acre (43,560 square feet) in size. A subdivision
development greater than or equal to one acre in size qualifies under this
subsection even if each of the individual lots in the subdivision is smaller
than one acre.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Special Concern Areas: Any parcel, lot or land development for which
the city determines that because of the nature or type of the parcel, lot or
development, disturbance of the land is likely to result in erosion or the
transport of sediment off of the site by stormwater to a degree substantially
greater than that which would occur under natural landscape conditions. (Ord.
169-03, 12-2-2003)
8-4B-4: APPLICATION FOR PERMIT:
Any person or entity desiring a permit must first file an application with the
city office. The application may be submitted independently, or as part of an
application for a subdivision preliminary site plan approval, site plan
approval or building permit.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Content: The application shall include a stormwater pollution
prevention plan which meets the criteria set forth in section
8-4B-6 of this article.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Time Of Filing: The applicant shall file the application on or before
the following dates:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subdivision: The date that the applicant submits the preliminary
subdivision plat application if the applicant proposes to develop a
subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Site Plan: The date that the applicant submits a site plan
application if the applicant proposes to develop a site plan or amended site
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Building Permit: The date that the applicant submits a building
permit application if the applicant proposes to construct a building on an
existing lot or parcel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Other: At least two (2) weeks before the developer intends to
perform any type of work not listed above that would require a permit pursuant
to this article.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Compliance: If an applicant's development comes under more than one of
the categories listed above, then the applicant shall submit the stormwater
construction activity application and permit on the earliest of the listed
dates. Failure to comply with the application dates set forth above is not a
criminal offense, but may delay the applicant's project. Failure to acquire a
required permit is grounds for denying a related subdivision application, site
plan application, conditional use permit application or building permit
application. It is unlawful to commence work (move dirt) on a development site
before obtaining a required permit.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Application Approval; Conditions: The director or designee shall
approve the application, grant the permit if the application is complete and
meets the criteria set forth in section
8-4B-6 of this article, and the applicant has paid all permit fees which the
city may prescribe by resolution. The director shall deny the application or
approve the application with conditions if he/she determines that the measures
proposed in the plan fail to meet the criteria set forth in section
8-4B-6 of this article. Conditions the director may impose in connection with
the approval of a permit include, but are not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The establishment of specific measures and controls to prevent
erosion; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The discharge of sediment, debris and other construction related
pollutants from the site by stormwater.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) The city issues a final certificate of occupancy for each lot
in the subdivision;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Individual permits have been issued for each lot in the
subdivision not having a final occupancy permit; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) The property has been revegetated or landscaped in a manner
that eliminates erosion and sediment discharge or that brings the property back
to its natural state.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Site Plans: For permits associated with a site plan approval, the
date that the permittee has completed all required landscaping and all outside
construction work associated with the site plan.

Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Termination: No permit shall be considered terminated until the
permittee submits a notice of termination of the stormwater connection and
activity application and permit ("notice") to the city and the notice is
accepted by the city. The city shall accept the notice if the permittee has met
the requirements of the permit and this article. The permittee shall keep and
maintain all permit required improvements on the site until the city accepts
the notice.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Amendments: In the event that the proposed construction activity for a
site to which a permit pertains is materially altered from that described in an
original stormwater pollution prevention plan in a way that may have a
significant impact upon the effectiveness of the measures and controls
described in the original stormwater pollution prevention plan, the permittee
shall file an amended stormwater pollution prevention plan which meets the
criteria set forth in section
8-4B-6 of this article. (Ord. 169-03, 12-2-2003)
8-4B-5: EXEMPTIONS:

8-4C-3: Definitions
8-4C-4: Storm Sewer Utility
8-4C-5: Storm Sewer Utility Fee
8-4C-6: Billing
8-4C-1: FINDINGS:
The city council makes the following findings regarding stormwater runoff and
the city storm sewer system:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The city's existing storm sewer system consists of a network of manmade
and natural facilities, structures and conduits, including groundwater and
aquifers, that collect and route stormwater runoff.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The city's existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the
stormwater runoff generated in the city.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The city's anticipated growth will place increased demands on the
already inadequate storm sewer system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff endangers the
city's groundwater supply.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff causes
erosion and property damage.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff hinders the
city's ability to provide emergency services to its residents.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff impedes the
regular flow of traffic in the city.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff poses health
hazards to the citizens of the community.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Stormwater runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease, nutrients,
chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials and other undesirable materials that
may jeopardize the integrity of groundwaters and receiving waters, including
the city's culinary water supply.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â All developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the
storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â All developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the
city's operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The state department of environmental quality (DEQ) has determined that
some of the city's stormwater sumps must be included on the prioritized
contamination sources for culinary wells.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â The EPA and the DEQ are developing additional stormwater permitting
requirements that will apply to cities.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control,
existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential
hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the city, its residents and
its businesses.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â A storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of
managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each property in the city
pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to, benefits
from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer system. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)
8-4C-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
city and its inhabitants by improving the city's storm sewer system, managing
and controlling stormwater runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted
waters from entering the city's water supply and other receiving waters, and
establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction, operation
and maintenance of the storm sewer system. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)
8-4C-3: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases shall be defined as follows:
DEVELOPED PARCEL: Any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition
by grading, filling or the construction of improvements or other impervious
surfaces.
EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT (ERU): The average amount of impervious surface,
expressed in square feet, on developed single-family residential parcels in
Uintah City. One ERU equals two thousand eight hundred (2,800) square feet of
impervious surface area.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: Any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that
prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes water
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at greater rates of flow than
the natural surface. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)
8-4C-4: STORM SEWER UTILITY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Creation: The city council hereby creates end establishes a storm sewer
utility as part of the city's overall sewer system. The storm sewer utility
shall plan, design, construct, maintain, administer and operate the city's
storm sewer system.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Enterprise Fund: The city council hereby establishes a storm sewer
utility enterprise fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial
transactions related to the storm sewer utility. All storm sewer utility
service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund. Money in the storm
sewer utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to
other city funds. However, the storm sewer utility may pay other city funds for
services and expenses directly attributable to the storm sewer utility. The
enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Facilities And Assets: The storm sewer utility shall operate
independently of city operations funded by the general fund. The storm sewer
utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities,
such as the water utility and the garbage utility. Upon creation of the
utility, all of the city's storm sewer facilities and assets (other than
streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city council) shall
be transferred to the storm sewer utility in consideration for the storm sewer
utility's agreement to take primary responsibility for planning, designing,
constructing, maintaining, administering and operating the city's storm sewer
system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Administration: The storm sewer utility shall be administered by the
water manager. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)
8-4C-5: STORM SEWER UTILITY FEE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Imposed: Each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be
charged a storm sewer utility fee.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â ERU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential
units (ERUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ERU is
the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel
contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility.
Based on a study completed by an independent engineer, the city council finds
and establishes that one ERU equals two thousand eight hundred (2,800) square
feet of impervious surface area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Calculation: The city council finds that each single-family residential
parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff;
therefore, each developed single-family residential parcel shall pay a base
rate of one ERU. All nonsingle-family residential parcels shall pay a multiple
of this base rate, expressed in ERUs, according to the measured impervious area
of the parcel. The city council may adopt separate rates for PRDs, condominiums
and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Charge Per ERU: The amount charged for each ERU shall be established by
resolution of the city council.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Exemptions And Credits: The city council may establish exemptions and
credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Policies: The water manager may adopt policies, consistent with this
article and any resolutions passed by the city council, to assist in the
application, administration and interpretation of this article and any
resolutions related to the storm sewer utility. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this article or any
storm sewer utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied erroneously may
appeal to the appeal authority as provided in title 9, chapter 5 of this code.
(Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005; amd. 2013 Code)
8-4C-6: BILLING:
The city council finds that the city's storm sewer system, sanitary sewer
system, culinary water system and solid waste collection system are
interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally
responsible manner. Therefore, the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on
the city's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no
regular utility bill for the property, the storm sewer utility fee shall be
charged to the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed
to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services
provided to the property. All properties shall be charged the fee, regardless
of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property requests the storm
sewer utility service. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may
result in termination of water service. (Ord. 184-05, 5-3-2005)

9-10-1: PURPOSE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The city council deems that in order to keep the peace, health, safety
and welfare and promote the best interest of the inhabitants of the city, these
sensitive land development regulations be created, which shall provide
standards, guidelines and criteria, having the effect of minimizing flooding,
fire, erosion and other natural and manmade hazards and protect people and
property while protecting the natural scenic character of the sensitive land
areas not suitable for development, or suitable for development only after
mitigation of hazards and ensuring the efficient expenditure of public funds.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The standards, guidelines and criteria to be achieved by the overlay
zone shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The protection of the public from natural and manmade hazards;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The minimizing of the threat and consequential damages of fire in
foothill areas by establishing fire protection measures;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The preservation of natural features, wildlife habitat and open
space;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The preservation of public access to mountain areas and natural
drainage channels;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The preservation and enhancement of visual and environmental quality
by use of natural vegetation and the prohibition of excessive excavation and
terracing;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The establishment of traffic circulation facilities that ensure
ingress and egress for vehicles, including emergency vehicles into all
developed areas at any time of the year with minimal cuts, fills or visible
scars;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The encouragement of a variety of development designs and concepts
that are compatible with the natural terrain of the foothill areas, that will
preserve open space and natural landscape;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The establishment of land use management criteria that will
encourage protection of natural elements while allowing a harmonious and
satisfying residential environment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Encouragement of regard for the view of the foothills, as well as
the view from the foothills; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Determine areas in the city that, due to geologic hazards, may not
be suitable for development or may require engineering measures to reduce the
hazards to an acceptable level. (Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-10-2: SCOPE AND APPLICATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands in the city
that are so designated as sensitive lands in the city's general plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â This chapter makes additional provisions to those set forth in this
title. Additional requirements not specifically in this chapter may be required
by the planning commission for property designated as sensitive land, if it
determines that it reasonably appears that there are additional hazards
associated with the site. In the event of conflict between such foregoing
designated chapters of this title, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The provisions of these amendments shall have no application to
subdivisions, planned unit developments or other construction projects, which
have been granted preliminary approval prior to the adoption of this chapter.
(Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-10-3: SENSITIVE LANDS OVERLAY MAP:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The city's general plan specifies areas of the city which are
development sensitive for various defined reasons. When these areas are
proposed for development, the applicant must go through the process outlined in
this chapter. Properties within this overlay may not be suitable for
development or may only be suitable after mitigation of the hazards associated
with the specific site. Development within sensitive lands may have one or more
of (but is not limited to) the following natural and manmade hazards: slope ten
percent (10%) or above, dense oak brush, faults/fault zones, high liquefaction
potential, debris flow and other sediment laden flows, flooding, landslides,
rockfalls, shallow groundwater, contaminated groundwater and wetlands.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In the event that there are hazards in an area that are not depicted on
the sensitive lands overlay map, studies may be required and the process
outlined in this chapter will be followed. (Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-10-4: PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW:
The planning commission review shall consist of members of the city staff,
building inspector and city council as necessary. Proposals in the overlay area
and geologic reports on sites in the overlay area shall be reviewed by the
planning commission, which is authorized to determine the process that
proposals will be required to go through for approval and make recommendations
to the city council. The planning commission is authorized to determine, after
review of submitted reports, if properties are appropriate for development.
(Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-10-5: APPEAL OF BOUNDARY OF MAPPED HAZARDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General; Verification: The boundary lines of the sensitive lands
overlay and the hazards therein are a general depiction and should be field
verified.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conflicts; Procedure: Where there is a conflict between the boundary
lines illustrated on the map and actual field conditions, or where mapped
hazards are not present within a particular area, the dispute shall be settled
as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The applicant shall submit to the city technical and geologic
evidence by a qualified engineering geologist to support the claim.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The planning commission (committee) and their geotechnical advisors,
which may include the Utah geologic survey or an independent geologist, may
require additional reviews.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If, after additional reviews are made, the planning commission
agrees with the applicant's engineer and the site is determined to be out of
the sensitive lands overlay area, the applicant may proceed with his or her
application. (Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â If, after additional reviews are made, a consensus is not reached by
the committee and the applicant, the item may be appealed to the appeal
authority after review and recommendation by the planning commission. (Ord.
172-04, 3-2-2004; amd. 2013 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The applicant shall pay any costs incurred for review. (Ord. 172-04,
3-2-2004)

PLANS:
Each step should be followed in the order outlined.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Meet With Planning Commission: The applicant shall meet with the
planning commission to determine the feasibility of the development and review
the general plan map to determine if the site is in the sensitive lands area
and if it is, what hazards are associated with the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the site is outside of the sensitive lands area, the process
outlined in the subdivision title will be followed. If it is subsequently
determined that the site is within the sensitive lands area or the site has
geologic hazards that are not shown on the map, the review process will be
pursuant to this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Building permits on single lots, whether or not in platted
subdivisions, which are in the sensitive lands areas, will follow the outline
through this section, after which the building permit may be issued
administratively after it is determined that the lot can be developed in
accordance with the intent of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If the only hazard associated with the site is high liquefaction,
then the applicant must submit a soils report with recommendations for control
of subsurface water, as well as footing and foundation design, after which the
proposal will follow the process outlined in section
9-10-11 of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Scope Of Work Submitted: A scope of work must be submitted by a
qualified consultant that will address all hazards associated with the site and
how each hazard will be evaluated.

constructed on the development site;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Such facilities shall be designed in accordance with accepted
engineering standards so as to retain safely and adequately the maximum
expected stormwater runoff for a 100-year storm (minimum), as per the city
engineering standards, for a sufficient length of time so as to prevent
flooding and erosion during stormwater runoff flow periods;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Such facilities shall be designed so as to divert surface water away
from cut surfaces or sloping surfaces of a fill; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Streets shall be designed to control and carry excess stormwater out
of the development on street surfaces within the curbed area. Low points on
streets shall not be allowed unless adequate drainage is provided.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Vegetation And Revegetation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All areas on development sites cleared of natural vegetation in the
course of construction of off site improvements shall be replanted with
vegetation, which, when established, shall have characteristics of erosion
control equal to or exceeding the original vegetation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â New plantings shall be protected with organic cover;

Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Exposed unstable surfaces of an excavation or fill shall not have a
ratio steeper than one vertical to two horizontal (1:2).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All permanent fill shall be located so that settlements, sliding or
erosions shall not damage or cover streets, curb, gutter and sidewalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All fill and degrees of compaction shall comply with the standards
of the adopted building code then in effect.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The top or bottom edges of slope caused by an excavation or fill up
to ten (10) vertical feet shall be at least three (3) horizontal feet from the
property line and street right of way lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The maximum vertical height of all cuts or fills shall be ten feet
(10'), except in special circumstances where the planning commission gives
specific approval, but shall not exceed twenty five feet (25') in any case.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â All structures, except retaining walls or soil stabilization
improvements, shall have a setback from the crest of the cut or base of the

cut, unless a structurally sound retaining wall is built for the cut or fill
slope. Retaining walls may be a part of the dwelling unit. Retaining wall
design and construction must be approved by the building inspector.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Streets And Ways: Streets, roadways and private accessways shall follow
as nearly as possible the natural terrain. The following additional standards
shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â At least two (2) ingress and egress routes shall be provided for
each subdivision or condominium project, in the long range development plans of
the development, unless it is determined by the planning commission that it is
not feasible due to topography or other constraints. If so determined,
additional development requirements may be imposed in order to mitigate
circumstances of a single access.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Points of access shall be provided, giving access to all developed,
partially developed or undeveloped areas for emergency and firefighting
equipment. Driveways located upon each lot extending from a public street shall

have an approved temporary turnaround at the end thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Centerline curvatures shall not have less than a one hundred foot
(100') radius on any curve street pattern.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Variations of the street design standard developed to solve special
hillside visual and functional problems may be presented to the planning
commission for consideration. Examples of such variations may be the use of
split roadways to avoid deep cuts, modifications of surface drainage treatments
or sidewalk design.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Architectural Design:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Buildings proposed for construction in the city sensitive lands
overlay zoning district shall be designed to be visually compatible with the
natural beauty of the foothills and canyon areas. The use of building materials
and colors that will blend harmoniously with the natural setting is required.
Such materials as natural woods, brick (earth tones) and stone are considered
to be most appropriate. Highly reflective glass is considered inappropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The planning commission shall review the design and specified
exterior materials and colors for all structures, other than single-family
dwellings. The building inspector shall review the plans of single-family
dwellings with respect to colors, materials, etc. Building permits for such
structures shall not be granted until building materials and colors have been
approved by the reviewing authority.

9-21-7: SPECIAL REGULATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buffer Distances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All extractive operations, roads, machinery, equipment and
stockpiles (excluding topsoil used for reclamation and screening and rock
crushing) shall be kept at least one hundred feet (100') horizontal distance
from any property line, except as may be reduced by the planning commission,
but in no event should the operation be closer than forty five feet (45') to
the property line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All rock crushing operations shall be conducted at least four
hundred feet (400') horizontal distance from any property line, except as may
be reduced by the planning commission for due cause, but in no event shall the
operation be closer than fifty feet (50') to the property line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All excavations shall be kept at least one hundred feet (100') from
a public road, except where the planning commission determines the excavations
may be moved closer if it will not endanger the users of the road.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fencing: Areas of excavation with serious or hazardous conditions shall
be fenced, except where, in the determination of the planning commission, other
suitable devices may be used.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Grading: All grading, to include specifications for slope
stabilization, shall be done in accordance with the latest reclamation plans,
with the concurrence of the city engineer.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Air And Water Quality: All air and water quality related plans and
actions shall be monitored and approved by the health department.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Hours Of Operation: Crushing, screening and hauling, except for the
maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, shall be confined to the
hours between six o'clock (6:00) A.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) P.M., Monday
through Friday, and Saturday from seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock
(7:00) P.M., except for operations that are isolated from other property owners
and have access to major transportation routes with little disturbance to
neighborhoods, or operations required to remain open for public emergency
demands as determined by the city council. Excavation sites with carefully
placed and landscaped berms can overcome any problems associated with day to
day mining operations; this will greatly reduce possible negative impacts on
adjoining properties.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Landscaping: Properties containing uses for which a natural resource
excavation permit is required shall be landscaped for purposes of screening
such uses from public streets and abutting properties not used for excavation
under this chapter.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Noise And Vibration: All equipment on site and off site utilized in the
extraction and processing of native natural resources shall be operated and
maintained so as to minimize the emanation of noise and vibration from the
premises. Soil berming, landscaping and other techniques should be used to
accomplish the objective of reducing the impact of noise and vibration on
adjacent property.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Roads: All permanent haul roads within five hundred feet (500') of
public streets and/or land not in a natural resource zone shall be regularly
surfaced with asphalt or oil, and all roadways shall be regularly watered,
swept or surfaced with a dust palliative.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Monuments: Monuments or other means of identification shall be placed
and maintained around the perimeter of the excavation site so as to enable
reasonable identification of the property line separating the excavation
property from adjoining landowners. (Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-21-8: ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT:
At the end of each calendar year, unless waived by the planning commission for
due cause, each operator conducting mining operations shall file an operations
and progress report with the planning commission. Part of this progress report
may be submitted on United States department of interior, bureau of mines form
OMB no. 42-RO264, or any successor form. The remainder of this report will
summarize activities in fulfillment of the requirements of simultaneous
excavation and reclamation in confirmation with the reclamation plan previously
submitted. (Ord. 172-04, 3-2-2004)
9-21-9: RECLAMATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Objectives: The objectives of excavation reclamation shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or within
a reasonable amount of time thereafter, to a predetermined condition defined by
the reclamation plan as submitted and approved, compatible with past, present
or probable future local land uses;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â To minimize or prevent present and future on site or off site
environmental degradation to the ecologic and hydrologic regimes caused by
mining operations and to meet other pertinent state and federal regulations
regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â To minimize or prevent present and future hazards to public safety
and welfare.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Simultaneous Excavation And Reclamation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resource sites with a
projected life of more than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with
the excavation of the resource. A few objectives of simultaneous excavation and
reclamation are to prevent shallow, stagnant, small bodies of water, small
unusable remnants of land and eroding, barren slopes, all normally associated
with open pit operations, except as providing stormwater detention facilities
as described in a hydrologic report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Excavations shall be planned so as to progressively develop the
proposed final landforms by grading and by stockpiling overburdened materials
in areas designated for future landforms or in excavations where the material
will be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated.
Such areas are to be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed
or within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and
planting shall be completed within one year. The reclamation plan shall contain
a description of the phased rehabilitation process throughout the anticipated
life of the mine.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Final Reclamation: Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any
site where operations authorized under a natural resource permit have been
abandoned for a period of at least one year, or otherwise terminated. The final
reclamation shall conform to the plan approved (including approved
modifications) in the natural resource permit. All reclamation plans shall
conform at least to the below listed minimum standards and requirements listed
elsewhere in this chapter; provided, however, that the planning commission may
require more stringent standards where special hazards exist in order to
protect the health, safety or general welfare of the public and to prevent
injury to property or improvements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Grading: Slopes, overburdened stockpiles and abandoned soil piles
shall be graded and smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation
of potentially dangerous areas in accordance with the direction of the city
engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Water Filled Areas: All excavations which create standing water or
ponds shall be refilled with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply,
however, to any water filled excavations scheduled to become an integral part
of the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done
in such a manner that the groundwater is not polluted as determined through
consultation with the health department. Fill material shall be porous to allow
for water dispersion unless otherwise specified in the reclamation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Landscaping: Unless inconsistent with the final proposed use of the
reclaimed land, the excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be
replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs, grasses or other vegetative ground
cover, preferably native to the area, in order to minimize erosion and to
restore the land to a natural appearance, or to an appearance previously
approved by the planning commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Removal Of Buildings And Equipment: As soon as excavation and/or
manufacturing has been permanently terminated, all buildings and equipment
(including electrical conduits) used in the administration of the operations
shall be removed, unless deemed necessary to the approved final use of the
reclaimed site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Excavation Closer To Property Lines: In the final year of
excavation, the mining operation may, as part of the reclamation project,
excavate closer than forty feet (40') to any property lines, but only upon a
showing of compelling mutual good and the approval of the planning commission
and city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Reclamation Verification: At the conclusion of mining operation and
reclamation of the excavation site, the building inspector, zoning
administrator and city engineer shall present to the planning commission a

application, except to determine whether the application is complete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the land use authority determines that an application is
incomplete, it shall notify the applicant of the incompleteness, highlighting
any insufficiencies and explaining that the application will not be reviewed
until it is complete.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For both preliminary and final applications, after the applicant
submits a complete application, the land use authority shall review and provide
feedback to the applicant in a series of "review cycles."
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A "review cycle" shall consist of the following phases:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Phase #1: The applicant submits a complete application (or, if
after the first cycle, submits a revised version of the complete application).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Phase #2: The land use authority reviews the application in
detail and assesses whether the application conforms to local ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Phase #3: The land use authority responds to the applicant,
citing any missing requirements or areas of noncompliance and providing a
detailed list of necessary revisions to the applicant. For any required
modification or addition to the application or request for more information,
the land use authority shall be specific and include citations to ordinances,
standards, or specifications that require the modification or addition and
shall provide the applicant with an index of all requested modifications or
additions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Phase #4: The applicant revises the application, addressing each
comment or requirement the land use authority made. The applicant must submit
both revised plans and a written explanation in response to the municipality's
review comments, identifying and explaining the applicant's revisions and
reasons for declining to make revisions, if any. If the applicant fails to
respond to a comment made by the land use authority in its review, the review
cycle is not complete and will remain open until the applicant addresses all
comments.

adhere to the maximum number of review cycles and the review deadlines
described in Table A, except as described below. If no further revisions are
needed, the land use authority may end the review process early and approve or
deny the preliminary or final application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â This provision notwithstanding, for any subdivision application that
affects property within an identified geological hazard area, the city is
exempt from limits on the number of permitted review cycles and the city's
deadlines for reviewing and responding (Phases #2 and #3).Â Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the applicant makes a material change to a preliminary or final
application not requested by the city at any point in the review process, the
land use authority may restart the review process, but only with respect to the
portion of the application that the material change substantively affects.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â For preliminary applications, if an applicant takes longer than
forty (40) business days to submit a revised subdivision improvement plan
responding to the city's requests for modifications and additions (in Phases #1
and #4), the city shall have an additional twenty (20) business days to review
and respond to the revised application (Phases #2 and #3 of the next review
cycle or issuing an approval decision).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â For both preliminary and final applications, if an applicant takes
longer than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days to submit a revised
application and respond to the city's request for modifications and additions
(Phases #1 and #4), the application shall, at the option of the land use
authority, expire. If an application expires, the applicant must restart the
subdivision application process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â If the applicant has not submitted a final application within three
hundred sixty five (365) calendar days after the land use authority notifies
the applicant that it has approved the related preliminary application, the
related preliminary approval shall expire. In this case the applicant shall not
submit a final application until the land use authority has issued a new
preliminary application approval.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â When a preliminary or final application's review period ends, the land
use authority shall approve or deny the respective preliminary or final
application within twenty (20) business days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the land use authority has not approved or denied the application
within twenty (20) business days after the allotted review cycles are complete,
the applicant may request a decision. After such a request, the city shall,
within ten (10) business days:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â For a dispute arising from the subdivision improvement plans,
assemble an appeal panel in accordance with Utah Code Â§ 10-9a-511(5)(d) to
review and approve or deny the revised set of plans; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â For a dispute arising from the subdivision ordinance review,
advise the applicant, in writing, of the deficiency in the application and of
the right to appeal the determination to the designated appeal authority.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â After the land use authority provides comments in the last allotted
review cycle for a final application, the city shall not require further
modifications or corrections to the application unless those modifications or
corrections are necessary to protect public health and safety or to enforce
state or federal law or unless the review cycle reset due to the applicant
making a material change that the land use authority did not request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â With the exception of modifications or corrections that are needed
to protect public health and safety, that are needed to enforce state or
federal law, or that arise from the review cycle being reset, the municipality
waives noncompliant subdivision-related requirements that the land use
authority does not identify during the review process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The applicant shall make reasonable changes unless prohibited
otherwise by a contract or deed, to the subdivision application to accommodate
the water conveyance facility to the extent required by Utah Code Â§ 73-1-15.5.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The land use authority may conduct a public hearing (up to the number
described in Table A) during the review period for a preliminary subdivision
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The purpose of these public hearings is to ask questions of the
applicant and receive commentary on the technical aspects of the application
from affected entities, interested parties, and the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the land use authority elects to hold a public hearing, the
hearing must occur before the end of the land use authority's preliminary
review period (end of Phase #3 of the last preliminary review cycle).
Scheduling issues shall not extend the review and approval deadlines in this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The land use authority shall not hold a public hearing during the
review period for a final subdivision application.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Other sections of this chapter notwithstanding, the land use authority
shall approve or deny preliminary and final applications under this chapter
after reviewing the complete applications as described in this section.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Material Testing: The developer shall be responsible for payment of
material testing required by the city engineer during construction of
subdivision improvements.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Plat Approval Required Prior To Improvements: No street improvements or
utilities shall be installed until after approval of the final plat by the land
use authority and recordation thereof with the county recorder. No lots
included in such plat shall be purchased, sold, exchanged, nor offered for sale
or exchange, and no construction of buildings or grading of land upon such lots
shall begin, until all fees to the city are paid in full and the final plat is
so approved and recorded.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-3-8: SIGNING AND RECORDING OF SUBDIVISION PLAT AND POST-APPROVAL ACTIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The land use authority shall approve any complete preliminary and final
applications made under this chapter that comply with municipal ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The land use authority shall issue all approval in writing and shall
certify the approved final plat, either by signing the plat directly or by
attaching a signed certification to the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When the final plat is in approved form as certificated by the land
use authority, the developer shall submit a review copy of the plat to the
Weber county surveyor for additional comments. The developer is responsible for
all county review and recording fees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Following corrections, as directed by the county surveyor, a mylar
shall be produced and delivered to the city recorder with the stamped and
signed surveyor's certificate, signed owner's dedication and any required
acknowledgments. The city acceptance signatures will then be obtained by the
city recorder and presented to the county recorder for final processing.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The land use authority may refuse to approve or renew any plat,
subdivision plan, or dedication of any street or other ground, if deed
restrictions, covenants, or similar binding agreements running with the land
for the lots or parcels covered by the plat or subdivision prohibit or have the
effect of prohibiting reasonably sited and designed solar panels or other
energy-conservation techniques from being installed on buildings erected on
lots or parcels covered by the plat or subdivision.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Mayor To Endorse Approval: When a bond or escrow is required, the mayor
shall endorse approval on the plat after the bond or escrow has been approved
by the city attorney and all the conditions of the resolution pertaining to the
plat have been satisfied.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Post-Approval Process:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The applicant shall record the approved final plat with the county
recorder's office within three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after the
land use authority approves the final application, provided that the applicant
has completed any improvements or posted any performance guarantee required by
city ordinances or described in the approved improvement plan. The applicant
shall not record the approved final plat until such improvements are completed
or guaranteed in compliance with city ordinances and the approved improvement
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â aÂ Â Â An approved final plat not properly recorded with the timeline
specified in this provision is void unless the planning commission approves an
extension.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â An approved final plat operates, when properly recorded, as the
land use authority's acceptance of the dedication of any streets or public
places. A properly approved and recorded final plat also vests the fee of any
dedicated parcels of land in the municipality for the public for the uses named
or intended in the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â City staff shall submit to the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (so
the subdivision can be included in the 911 database), within thirty (30)
calendar days after the final application is approved, either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â An electronic copy of the approved final plat; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Preliminary geospatial data that depicts any new streets and
situs addresses proposed for construction within the bounds of the approved
final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If requested by the Utah Geospatial Resource Center, the city staff
shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Coordinate with the Utah Geospatial Resource Center to validate
the information the municipality submitted about the final plat; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Assist the Utah Geospatial Resource Center in creating electronic
files that contain the information described in the final plat for inclusion in
the unified statewide 911 emergency service database.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Phasing: Subdivisions containing more than twenty (20) lots must be
done in phases. Each phase must be approved by the planning commission and
shall consist of that number of lots that can be completely developed with off-
site improvements within a two (2) year period. Offsite improvements are
construed to be those improvements required by the city public works standards.
On site improvements shall be construed to mean the construction of the
dwelling and its appurtenant improvements on each lot. The development of the
subdivision shall be in an orderly manner and all of the said off-site
improvements will be made available for the full, effective, and practical use
and enjoyment thereof by lessees or grantees of any of the lands located within
the subdivision within the time hereinafter specified. Phases shall be designed
to minimize the dead ending of streets and water lines. Phasing shall be done
in such a manner as to provide sufficient traffic circulation in each of the
phases.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-3-9: EXCEPTIONS TO SPECIFIC APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Development Agreements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subdivisions platted in a valid development agreement are exempt
from the application requirements and review and approval of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Clauses in a valid development agreement with the city supersede all
conflicting requirements in this title, except where a clause in the
development agreement poses a substantial danger to the health and safety of
city residents.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-3-10: NOTICE TO AFFECTED ENTITIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving a complete
subdivision application under this chapter, city staff shall provide written
notice of the proposed subdivision to the facility owner of any known water
conveyance facility located, entirely or partially, within one hundred (100)
feet of the subdivision plat, as determined using information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â From the facility owner under Utah Code Â§ 10-9a-211, using mapping-
grade global positioning satellite units or digitized data from the most recent
aerial photo available to the facility owner;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the state engineer's inventory of canals; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â From a surveyor under Utah Code Â§ 10-9a-603 (6)(c).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To give water conveyance facility owners time to provide feedback on
subdivision applications, the land use authority shall not approve a
preliminary (or related final) subdivision application under this chapter
sooner than twenty (20) calendar days after the applicant submits a complete
application. This waiting period does not apply to revised applications the
applicant may submit during the application review process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A water conveyance facility owner's failure to provide comments to
the land use authority about a subdivision application does not affect or
impair the land use authority's authority to approve the subdivision
application.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-3-11: AMENDING A SUBDIVISION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The city council may vacate a subdivision or a portion of a subdivision
by enacting an ordinance to that effect that describes the subdivision, or the
portion being vacated and recording that ordinance in the county recorder's
office.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A property owner or agent of a property owner may correct minor
typographical or clerical errors in a document of record by filing with the
county an affidavit or other appropriate instrument. This provision does not
apply to changing the name of a subdivision, which requires a material
amendment described in the following provisions.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A fee owner of land in a platted subdivision may request a material
subdivision amendment by filing a written petition with the planning
commission. This petition must meet all the requirements for a preliminary
subdivision application specified in Chapter 3, with the following changes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The preliminary plat (or the record of survey map, if applicable)
should:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Depict only the portion of the subdivision that is proposed to be
amended;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Include a plat name distinguishing the amended plat from the
original plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Describe the differences between the amended plat and the
original plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Include references to the original plat; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Meet all the other plat requirements specified in Chapter 3.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The petition must additionally include the name and address of each
property owner affected by the petition and the signature of each of those
property owners who consent to the petition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The petitioner must include with the petition envelopes addressed to
each property in the subdivision.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Upon receipt of an amendment petition, the planning commission (or city
staff, as delegated) shall provide notice of the petition to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Each utility provider that services a parcel of the subdivision. The
city shall not approve an amendment petition until at least ten (10) days after
noticing these utility providers. The city may notify the utility providers in
any effective manner (email, mail, etc.).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Each property owner in the subdivision. The city shall notify these
property owners by mail.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The planning commission shall hold a public hearing before approving an
amendment petition and within forty-five (45) calendar days after the day on
which the petition is submitted if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A property owner objects in writing to the amendment within ten (10)
days of the city notifying the property owner by mail, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Not every property owner in the subdivision has signed the revised
plat.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Notwithstanding section
10-3-8, the planning commission need not hold a public hearing if notice has
been given to adjoining property owners in accordance with any applicable local
ordinance and the petition seeks to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Join two (2) or more of the petitioner's contiguous lots;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Subdivide one or more of the petitioner's lots;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Adjust the lot lines of adjoining lots or between a lot and an
adjoining parcel if the fee owners of each of the adjoining properties join in
the petition, regardless of whether the properties are located in the same
subdivision;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â On a lot owned by the petitioner, adjust an internal lot restriction
imposed by the local political subdivision; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Alter the plat in a manner that does not change existing boundaries
or other attributes of lots within the subdivision that are not owned by the
petitioner or designated as a common area.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â If the planning commission approves the amendment petition, the
planning commission shall sign the amended plat in the manner described in
section 11.8.2.6.2, and the petitioner shall record the plat, subject to the
completion, or guarantee of any improvements, as described in section 11.8.2.7.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-3-12: LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The fee owners of two (2) parcels may petition to adjust the lot line
separating the parcels without a subdivision amendment. Such a petition shall
include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A record of survey map and a metes-and-bounds description showing
the adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An explanation of the reason for the adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Signatures from all the parcel owners involved in the adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Any other information the planning commission requests.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the adjustment will not result in a violation of a land use
ordinance or an adverse development condition, the planning commission shall
approve the petition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the adjustment is approved, the planning commission shall sign
the record of survey map and accompanying metes-and-bounds description, and the
petitioner shall record the document in the county recorder's office.

10-4-2: COST OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All required improvements shall be made by the applicant/developer, at
their expense, without reimbursement by the city or any improvement district
therein, and in accordance with related codes, fee schedules, and ordinances.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-3: COMPLETION AND INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Before a subdivision plat may be recorded, and before a building permit
may be issued, all improvements required by this chapter or other city
ordinances shall be either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Completed, inspected, and accepted by the city; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Guaranteed according to section 10.4.5.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The decision whether to guarantee an improvement or to complete it
before recording and obtaining a building permit rests solely with the
applicant.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All improvements are subject to city inspection before such
improvements may be accepted by the city or considered complete. The public
works inspector or the city engineer shall provide the inspection of required
improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. If
they find, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the city construction standards and
specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the
improvements or bringing them up to the city construction standards. The
expense of all inspections will be billed to the developer.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All public improvements are subject to the warranty described in
section 10.4.5.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The applicant/developer shall, in accordance with the city's fee
schedule, pay the city an inspection fee before the city shall accept any
improvements.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The provisions of this chapter do not supersede the terms of a valid
development agreement, an adopted phasing plan, or the state construction code.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â For subdivisions for which no performance guarantee has been posted, if
the improvements are not completed within the period specified in the approved
subdivision improvement plan, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In
those cases where a performance guarantee has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance
guarantee, the city may thereupon declare the guarantee to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the guarantee is declared to be in default.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-4: MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks until acceptance of said improvements by the city council. If there
are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the city, the
city may on twelve (12) hours' notice plow the street or effect emergency
repairs and charge the same to the applicant. The city will not normally accept
water improvements or street improvements or assume responsibility for either
general maintenance or snow removal until over fifty percent (50%) of the lots
within the subdivision are built upon.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The applicant/developer shall be required to file a maintenance
guarantee with the city, prior to acceptance, in an amount considered adequate
by the city engineer in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required improvements, including all lot improvements on the individual
subdivided lots for a period of one (1) year after the date of their acceptance
by the city and dedication of same.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Reduction Of Performance Bond Or Escrow Funds: The city shall not
release nor reduce a performance bond or escrow funds on any required
improvement until the developer provides a statement for monies requested,
signed by the city engineer or public works, noting the improvements have been
satisfactorily completed. In no event shall escrow funds or a performance bond
be reduced below ten percent (10%) of the principal amount.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-5: IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES, COMPLETION ASSURANCES, AND WARRANTIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If an applicant elects to guarantee any required improvement, the
applicant shall provide completion assurance for one hundred ten percent (110%)
of the cost of the improvement, guaranteeing that the improvements will be
completed within two (2) years after the date of the guarantee.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For the purpose of posting an improvement guarantee, the cost of the
improvement shall be determined by an engineer's estimate or licensed
contractor's bid.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The city shall accept any of the following forms of guarantee for an
improvement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Performance Bonds: The developer may furnish and file with the city
recorder a corporate surety bond in an amount equal to the cost of the required
improvements, plus ten percent (10%), as estimated by the developer and
approved by the city engineer to secure the installation of required
improvements within one (1) year from the date the final plat is recorded and
to secure the ten percent (10%) guarantee amount for one (1) year beyond the
date of conditional final acceptance of improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Deposit In Escrow: The developer may deposit in escrow with an
escrow holder approved by the city council an amount of money equal to the cost
of improvements required, plus ten percent (10%), as estimated by the developer
and approved by the city engineer under an escrow agreement conditioned for the
installation of said improvements within one (1) year from the date the final
plat is recorded. The escrow agreement aforesaid shall be approved by the land
use authority and shall be filed with the city recorder. The ten percent (10%)
improvement guarantee amount will be held for one (1) year beyond the date of
conditional final acceptance of improvements.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Default: In the event the developer defaults, fails or neglects to
satisfactorily install the required improvements within one (1) year from the
date the final plat is recorded, the city may declare the bond or escrow
deposit forfeited, and the city may install or cause the required improvements
to be installed using the proceeds from the collection of the bond or escrow to
defray the expense thereof. The land use authority may, upon proof of
difficulty, extend the completion date for a maximum period of one additional
year.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â As improvements are completed, inspected, and accepted by the city, the
city council, with the advice of the land use authority shall, each quarter, at
the option of the applicant, issue a partial release of escrow funds
proportional to the improvements accepted during the prior quarter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subject to maintenance provisions contained in this code below, the
city will not accept dedication of required improvements, or release or reduce
a performance guarantee, until the city engineer has submitted a certificate
stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and
until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer,
through submission of detailed "as-built" survey plats of, the subdivision,
indicating location, dimensions, materials, improvements and other information
required by the planning commission and city engineer, that the layout of the
line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with the city
approved construction plans for the subdivision and that a title insurance
policy has been furnished to the city and city engineer indicating that the
improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication to the local
government and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In no event shall a performance guarantee be reduced below twenty
five percent (25%) retainage of the principal amount until total completion.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The city shall not require improvement guarantees for any of the
prohibited uses listed in Utah Code Â§ 10-9a-604.5(3)(d), including improvements
the city has previously inspected and accepted, private improvements that are
not essential to meet the building code, fire code, flood or storm water
management provisions, street and access requirements, or other essential
necessary public safety improvements adopted in a land use regulation.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Upon acceptance of all required improvements, the applicant shall
warrant that said improvements shall remain free from defects in material and
workmanship for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of acceptance by
the city. The subdivider shall be solely responsible for all repairs and
maintenance required to keep the improvements in good working condition for
this 12-month period.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-6: CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Violations Prior To Permit Issuance: No building permit or certificate
of occupancy shall be granted or issued if a developer or his authorized agent
shall have violated any federal, state, or local law pertaining to consumer
protection of real estate land sales, promotion, or practices, or any
applicable conflicts-of-interest legislation with respect to the lot or parcel
of land which is the subject of the permit or certificate, until so ordered by
a court of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Revocation Of Permits And Certificates Of Occupancy: With respect to
said lot or parcel of land, in the event a building permit or certificate of
occupancy has been granted or issued, it shall be subject to revocation by the
city until so ordered otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided
that in no event shall the rights of intervening innocent third parties in
possession of a certificate of occupancy be prejudiced by any such revocation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Penalties For Violation: Any violation of a federal, state, or local
consumer protection law (including but not limited to: Postal Reorganization
Act of 1970; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970; Interstate Land Sales
Full Disclosure Act; the Truth in Lending Act; the Uniform Commercial Credit
Code; State "Blue Sky" laws; State subdivision disclosure acts or conflicts of
interest statute, law, or ordinance) shall be deemed a violation of these
regulations and subject to all of the penalties and proceedings as set forth in
this code.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-7: ACCEPTANCE OF OFF SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conditional Acceptance: After the completion of all off site
improvements and upon receiving a written statement from the city engineer that
all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed, the city council
shall conditionally accept the improvements for a one-year guarantee period.
Such approval shall not be given until the applicant's engineer has certified
to the city engineer, through submission of detailed "as built" construction
plans of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials and other
information required by the city engineer, that the layout of the line and
grade of all public improvements is in accordance with the construction plans
filed with the final plat. Said "as built" plans shall be submitted in ink on
reproducible mylar. A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total principal
amount of the escrow funds or performance bond or letter of credit commitment,
will be held during this one- year guarantee period.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Guarantee Period: The developer shall warrant and guarantee that the
improvements provided for hereunder and every part thereof will remain in good
condition, and that the subdivider shall assume all liability which may arise,
and shall agree to hold the city harmless from any and all liability which may
arise as a result of the improvements which are installed for a period of one
(1) year after the date of conditional acceptance by the city, and agrees to
make all repairs to maintain the improvements and every part thereof in good
condition during the guarantee period at no cost to the city. The guarantee
shall extend to and include, but shall not be limited to, the entire street,
subgrade base and surface, all pipes, curbs, gutters, approaches, sidewalks,
fences and other accessories that are or may be affected by the construction
operations. Whenever, in the judgment of the city engineer, said work shall be
in need of repair, maintenance or rebuilding, he shall cause a written notice
to be served upon the developer and thereupon, the developer shall undertake
and complete such repairs, maintenance or rebuilding. The determination of the
necessity for repairs and maintenance of the work rests with the city engineer,
whose decision upon the matter shall be final and binding upon the developer.
Upon the developer's failure to perform the required repair work within sixty
(60) days from the date of service of such written notice, the city shall have
such repairs made, and the cost of such repairs shall be paid for by the use of
the ten percent (10%) guarantee funds.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Final Acceptance: Except for sidewalks and seal coat, final inspection
by the city engineer shall be made eleven (11) months after conditional
acceptance or as close as weather conditions permit. All defects as noted in
the final inspection report of the city engineer shall be corrected to the
satisfaction of the city engineer. Final acceptance shall be in writing by the
city council after written approval is received from the city engineer. After
final acceptance by the city council, the remaining balance in the escrow fund
or performance bond shall be released.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-8: SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS FOR SIDEWALKS (IF REQUIRED FOR A SUBDIVISION):
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conditional Acceptance: The land use authority, in its discretion, may
allow the developer an additional one year from the date of conditional
acceptance of the off-site improvements to install the sidewalks in the
subdivision; provided, that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The subdivision does not front on a major street where installation
of the sidewalk is necessary for the safety of the general citizenry.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All lots built on in the subdivision have sidewalks installed on the
lot where shown on the construction plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Sidewalks must be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy for any dwelling in the subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â No more than seventy five percent (75%) of the lots are built on in
the subdivision. When the percentage of lots built on exceeds seventy five
percent (75%), the sidewalk must be installed before any additional building
permits are issued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The city shall not conditionally accept any of the sidewalks prior
to the installation of all the sidewalks required in the subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The city retains ten percent (10%) of the escrow funds for the
sidewalks until final acceptance is given by the land use authority.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Guarantee Period: The developer shall warrant and guarantee that the
sidewalks will remain in good condition for a period of one (1) year after the
date of conditional acceptance by the land use authority, and shall make all
repairs to and maintain the sidewalks in good condition during the guarantee
period at no cost to the city. The determination of the necessity for repairs
and maintenance or work rests with the city engineer, whose decision upon the
matter shall be final and binding on the developer.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Final Acceptance: Final acceptance of the sidewalks will follow the
same procedure as outlined in subsection
10-4-3C of this chapter.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-4-9: ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Certificates Of Occupancy:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The extent of street and water improvements shall be adequate for
vehicular access and fire control by the prospective occupant and by police and
fire equipment prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. For
purposes of this section, "adequate" shall mean grading, subgrading preparation
and installation of road base on streets, and installation of all water mains,
valves, hydrants and other appurtenances for the water system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Certificates of occupancy will not be issued on any home within a
subdivision prior to the installation of any improvement determined to be
necessary for public safety, in complete and satisfactory condition as
determined by the city engineer, and a letter of final approval on the septic
system from the health department.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Building Permits: No building permit shall be issued nor escrow or
bonds released for the final ten percent (10%) of lots in a subdivision, or if
ten percent (10%) is less than two (2), for the final two (2) lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by city ordinances or under
an applicantâs approved subdivision improvement plan have been fully completed
and conditionally accepted by the land use authority

10-5-1: GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conformance To Applicable Rules And Regulations: In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules and regulations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All applicable statutory provisions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The zoning title, building and housing codes, and all other
applicable laws of the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The general plan, transportation element of the general plan and
capital facilities plan of the city (as may be applicable), including all
streets, drainage systems and parks shown on the transportation element of the
general plan or general plan, as adopted;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
health department and/or appropriate state agencies;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The rules of the state highway department if the subdivision or any
lot contained therein abuts a state highway;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The Uintah public works standards and technical specifications.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Monuments: The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in
the subdivision as required herein and as approved by the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Monuments shall be located on street right of way centerlines, at
street intersections and at such other points as determined necessary by the
city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All monuments shall be set in an approved ground box as specified in
the public works standards for the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All monuments shall be properly set in the ground by the developer
and approved by the city engineer prior to the time the city council grants
conditional acceptance of the required public improvements of a subdivision.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Character Of The Land: Land which the planning commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, wetlands, improper
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements or other such features which will reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be laid
out or platted or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the
developer and approved by the land use authority, upon recommendation of the
city engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Soil Conditions: Buildings or structures shall not be situated on soft
or unsuitable soils, as determined by the city engineer, where there is a high
water table, or a site subject to flooding as noted on the city floodplain map,
or on noncompacted fill in accordance with the city public works standards.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Subdivision Name: The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically the name of any other
subdivision in Weber County.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-2: LOT IMPROVEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Lot Arrangement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning title and
health regulations, and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots
from an approved street. A lot shall not be divided by a city limit or county
line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All subdivisions shall result in the creation of lots, which are
developable, and provide satisfactory and desirable sites for buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All remnants of lots below minimum size leftover after subdividing
of a tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed to remain as
unusable (remainder) parcels.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The minimum area and dimensions of all lots shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning title for the district in which the subdivision is
located, and to the minimum requirements of the health department for water
supply and sewage disposal. The minimum width for any residential building lot
shall be as required by the zoning title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Where the land covered by a subdivision includes two (2) or more
parcels in separate ownership, and the lot arrangement is such that a property
ownership line divides one or more lots, the land in each lot so divided shall
be transferred by deed to either single or joint ownership before approval of
the final plat, and such transfer certified to the land use authority by the
county recorder.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the zoning title. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area
for the zoning district, the planning commission may require that such lots be
arranged to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where
they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with
the zoning title and these regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at
right angles to street lines (or radial to curving streets lines) unless
variation from this rule will give a better street to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front yard and side setbacks from both
streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off
street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in the zoning title. All property
located within a subdivision shall be included within the boundaries of a road,
lot, or other improved area such that no parts or parcels of land therein
remain unusable.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Double/Reversed Frontage Lots And Access To Lots:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided, except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation, as determined by the planning commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Access From Arterial Streets: Lots should not, in general, derive
access exclusively from arterial streets. Where driveway access from a primary
or secondary arterial street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the
planning commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access
drive to limit possible traffic hazards on such street. Where possible,
driveways should be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back
into traffic on major streets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Gore Shaped Lots: On lots having more than four (4) sides, the
buildable area shall be determined by the building inspector and zoning
administrator.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â R Lots: All R lots shall be clearly identified on the recorded plat and
on a recordable instrument in form acceptable to the city. The instrument shall
be recorded in the office of the Weber County recorder at the time the final
plat is recorded in order to provide notice to potential lot purchasers of the
existence of limitations imposed upon R lot development.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Flag Lots 1: The city does not allow the use of flag lots in
subdivisions greater than three (3) lots.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Debris And Waste: No cut trees, timber, debris, earthy rocks, stones,
soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried on any
land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of conditional
acceptance of the required public improvements of a subdivision, and removal of
the same shall be required prior to final acceptance by the land use authority
of such improvements.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Staking Of Lots: Permanent corner markers shall be placed at all rear
lot corners to completely identify the lot boundaries on the ground. Front lot
corners shall be identified with permanent reference plugs or nails in the
concrete curb or road. All lot corner markers must be in place prior to the
issuance of building permits and after the completion of all subdivision
improvements. All lot corners shall be designated in accordance with state/
county survey laws.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-3: STREETS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General Requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Frontage On Improved Streets:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be laid out
and platted shall have frontage on and access from an improved and dedicated
city street, unless the street is an existing state or county highway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Wherever the area to be laid out and platted is to utilize
existing street frontage, such streets shall be fully improved as required by
the public works standards, unless otherwise provided for by the planning
commission. If the street is leased in the city, permission to access the
street must be obtained by the developer from the lessor prior to the issuance
of any building permits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Access to a subdivision must be from an existing, maintained
public roadway of sufficient width and improvement to meet required lot line to
lot line minimum requirements for the assurance of public safety, as determined
by the city engineer, police and fire departments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Whenever a subdivider submits plans for a subdivision in an area
which has only a single street providing access and the subdividerâs
development will create a situation of overcrowding and/or excessive traffic on
that single access, the subdividerâs plans and specifications must include a
second access street to a collector or arterial street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Grading And Improvement Plans: Streets shall be graded and improved
and conform to the city public works standards and shall be approved as to
design and specifications by the fire chief and the city engineer, in
accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final
plat approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Topography And Arrangement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All
streets shall be arranged to service a maximum number of building sites at or
above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as
possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves
shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the public works
standards of the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights of way established on the
transportation element of the general plan. Such integration shall take
topographical conditions into consideration. The street arrangements shall not
cause unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property. Additional trips
generated by the subdivision shall not exceed existing street capacities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Half streets proposed along a subdivision boundary or within
any part of a subdivision shall not be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Standard residential streets shall approach the arterial or
collector streets at an angle of not less than eighty degrees (80o).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â All streets shall be properly related to special traffic
generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
subdivision. All streets required to be extended to the boundary lines of the
subdivision shall be properly terminated with a temporary turnaround (if no
further development could occur), which shall have a minimum radius of one
hundred feet (100') and shall have a structural section of at least six inches
(6") of road base on prepared subgrade and shall have sufficient stability to
support snowplows, emergency vehicles, school buses and trash collection
trucks. If the turnaround is to be placed within the limits of the proposed
development, it shall be fully improved and dedicated as a cul-de-sac. If the
terminal street extends no more than the length of one lot beyond the
intersection, the planning commission may wave the turnaround requirement as
stated herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, and
the provision for alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, walks and
parking areas so as to minimize conflict or movement between the various types
of traffic, including pedestrians.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â All streets in city subdivisions shall be dedicated to the city,
except that private streets may be approved under special circumstances as
determined by the planning commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Arterial and collector streets shall conform to the width
designated on the "Transportation Element Of The General Plan" whenever a
subdivision is located in an area for which a transportation plan element has
been adopted. For territory where such street plan has not been completed at
the time the preliminary plat is submitted to the planning commission, arterial
or collector streets shall be provided as required by the city public works
standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Standard residential streets shall have a minimum right of way
width of sixty feet (60'), lot line to lot line. Any right of way approved to
be a future residential street prior to 1997, having not less than fifty feet
(50'), lot line to lot line, may be allowed per decision of the planning
commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs may provide frontage for no more than nine (9)
dwelling units. The length and grade of a cul-se-sac shall meet the currently
adopted fire code provisions. Each cul-de-sac must be terminated by a
turnaround of not less than one hundred feet (100') in diameter. If surface
water drainage is into the turnaround due to the grade of the street, necessary
catch basins and drainage easements shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â Utility and drainage easements shall be provided along lot lines
of all subdivision lots and at such other locations as deemed necessary and as
directed by the city. The easements shall have a minimum width of ten feet
(10'), but may encumber adjoining lots by extending across adjoining lot lines.
In some cases, larger size easements may be required as directed by the city.
Proper coordination shall be established between the developer and the
applicable utility company for the establishment of utility easements on
adjoining properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â All proposed streets, whether public or private, shall conform to
the street cross section standards as recommended by the city engineer and
adopted by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Streets shall be numbered unless the planning commission
determines, based upon topography and other like considerations, that streets
should be named.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Blocks:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers
of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, waterways, or topography
concerns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate for
the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block lengths in
residential areas shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty feet
(1,320') or twelve (12) times the minimum lot width required in the zoning
district, whichever is less, nor to less than four hundred feet (400') in
length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major streets and collector streets
shall be not less than six hundred sixty feet (660') in length.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â In long blocks, the planning commission may require the
reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities or pedestrian traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than six feet (6') wide,
may be required by the planning commission through the center of blocks more
than eight hundred feet (800') long where deemed essential to provide
circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, transportation or other
community facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Access To Major Streets: Where a subdivision borders on or contains
an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require that
access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the street and front
onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the street in
the rear, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land no less than five
feet (5') in width along the rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A marginal access or service road (separated from the street by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Street Regulatory Signs:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The applicant shall deposit with the city, at the time of final
subdivision approval, a sum determined by the director of public works for each
sign required by the city. The city shall install all street signs before the
issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the streets is
approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Street signs are to be placed at all intersections within or
abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which is to be approved by
the public works director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Streetlights: The subdivider will be responsible for coordinating
with the public utility providing power, and the public works director, to
ensure installation of streetlighting in locations determined by the city. All
streetlighting shall be installed on city approved poles. The subdivider shall
pay all costs of providing streetlighting and all construction shall be in
accordance with applicable power company specifications.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Design Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General: In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, design standards for street
sections shall be as outlined in the city public works standards, or as
otherwise approved by the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Road Surfacing And Improvements: After pipes, lines and related
facilities pertaining to sewer, water, gas, cable TV, electricity and like
utility services, where required, have been installed by the developer, and
shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in
these regulations. Said surfacing shall be in accordance with the city public
works standards. Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts, drains,
canals, and bridges. Driveway approaches shall not be installed at the time of
placement of curb and gutter. Driveway approaches will be determined by the
building inspector at the time of request for a building permit and will be the
responsibility of the homeowner or builder.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Intersections:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of
less than eighty degrees (80Â°) shall not be acceptable. An oblique street shall
be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right
angles for at least one hundred feet (100') therefrom. Not more than two (2)
streets shall intersect at any one point, unless specifically approved by the
planning commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred fifty feet (150') shall not be permitted, except where the
intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either
intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. The intersection of major street shall be at least eight hundred
feet (800') apart, or in accordance with Uintah City master transportation
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right of way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Street Dedications And Reservations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an
existing half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the developer. The planning
commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the developer improves
and dedicates the entire required street right of way width which must be
within the subdivision boundaries. At the discretion of the planning
commission, and in accordance with all city ordinances, the developer may
retain a protection strip of one foot (1') in width between the street and
adjacent property. An agreement with the city, approved by the planning
commission, shall be made by the developer to dedicate the one-foot (1')
protection strip free of charge to the city. Consideration for acquisition of
one-foot (1') strip is to be equal to the cost, at the time of the agreement,
of the street improvements, including utility lines properly chargeable to the
contiguous property, plus the value of the land from the right of way line to
the centerline of the street at the time of the agreement, together with
interest computed at the then statutory rate. Interest shall accrue only from
the time of agreement until the time of subdivision of such contiguous property
or ten (10) years from the date of the agreement, whichever is less. All
charges to be associated with the protection strip, as well as the interest
rate, shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer and shall be recorded
as part of the agreement. All property owned by the developer shall be included
on both the preliminary plat and final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where the developer is required to improve the full width of an
existing city-owned right of way on the perimeter of his subdivision, the city
may enter into a similar agreement as outlined above. In this agreement, the
developer will not own a one foot (1') protection strip and the consideration
named in the agreement will not include the value of the land or any utilities
installed in the right of way prior to the agreement. However, the agreement
will stipulate that before approval is given to the development on the adjacent
property abutting the street, the adjacent property owners will reimburse the
aforementioned developer as outlined in the agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Widening And Realignment Of Existing Streets: Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow street or when the general plan, transportation
element of the general plan, zoning setback regulations or public works
standards indicate plans for the realignment or widening of a street that would
require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be
required to improve and dedicate, at his expense, such areas for widening or
realignment of such streets. Such frontage streets shall be improved and
dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full width as required by
these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any street purposes may not be
counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning title, whether
the land is to be dedicated to the municipality in fee simple or an easement is
granted to the city.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 262-20, 11-17-2020; Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-4: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General Requirements: The planning commission shall not recommend for
approval any plat of subdivision which does not make adequate provision for
storm or flood water runoff channels or basins. The city engineer shall make
the determination of adequate provision. The stormwater drainage system shall
be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and/or irrigation
(ditches, canals, pipes) systems. Storm drainage point of discharge from a
channel or conduit shall be protected from erosion by suitable structure or
lining, as approved by the city engineer. Storm sewers, where required, shall
be protected from erosion by a suitable structure or lining, with the design
and method approved by the city and the city engineer. A copy of design
computations shall be submitted along with the construction plans. All
locations and sizes of storm sewer lines and basins shall be in conformance
with the requirements as specified by the city and the city engineer.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nature Of Stormwater Facilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Location: The applicant may be required by the planning commission
to carry away by pipe any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right of way where feasible or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in
accordance with the city public works standards and shall be approved by the
city and the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Accessibility To Public Storm Sewers: Where a public storm sewer is
accessible, the applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no
outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for
the disposal of stormwaters, subject to the city public works standards.
However, in commercial zones, underground storm sewer systems shall be
constructed throughout and be conducted to an approved outfall. Construction of
all stormwater sewers or connections thereto are the full responsibility of the
developer. An inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the city engineer
and public works director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: A storm sewer line or
other drainage facilities shall in each case be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or
outside the subdivision and/or the city boundaries. The city engineer shall
determine the necessary size of the facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Effect On Downstream Drainage Areas: The city engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the planning commission may withhold
approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement
of said potential conditions in a manner the planning commission shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage facility.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Floodplain Areas: The planning commission may, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and
sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property
which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These
floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage
resulting from clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste materials or
stumps, except at the discretion of the planning commission. The planning
commission may also, when it deems necessary for the health, safety or welfare
of present or future population, deny the construction of basements in the
floodplain areas. All construction of homes permitted in flood areas must have
sump pumps.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Dedication Of Drainage Easements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General Requirements: Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, canal, channel or stream, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially to the
lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will
be adequate for the purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Drainage Easements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights of way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen feet (15') in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to the nearest existing
drainage facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement, land on both sides of the proposed or existing drainage
system to a distance to be determined by the planning commission. Said
easements shall be deemed rights of way for lawful municipal purposes.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-5: SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE:
Â Â Â The applicant is required to provide the design and installation of a
subsurface drainage system, when determined to be necessary by the city
engineer, which meets the city public works standards.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-6: WATER FACILITIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General Requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The owner/developer of any land proposed to be developed as a
subdivision shall, at his expense, be required to comply with all regulations
of the current city standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The developer shall be required to install adequate water
facilities, including fire hydrants. All water lines must be extended across
the entire frontage of all existing and proposed streets and to the boundary of
the subdivision on all existing or proposed streets. Main valves and other
appurtenances shall be installed in accordance with city standards or as
otherwise required by the city engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All proposed water improvements shall comply with the city standards
and be approved by the water department.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions.
Fire hydrants shall be located no more than five hundred feet (500') apart and
within two hundred fifty feet (250') of any structure and shall be approved by
the fire department. Such fire hydrants shall be of the type, size and number
and installed in such locations as determined by the city engineer, and in
accordance with development standards. Fire hydrants or blowouts shall be
provided at all dead end lines as specified by the city engineer. To eliminate
future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together
with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply improvements, shall be
installed before any final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.
(Ord. 154-01, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-7: CULINARY IRRIGATION WATER:
Â Â Â It is the intention of the city to provide limited culinary irrigation water
to ensure that properties have water for basic landscape needs, can be
sufficiently beautified when viewed from the street, and to help property
owners control the spread of noxious or unsightly weeds. Guidance for the use
of city provided culinary irrigation water and additional privately sourced
irrigation water can be found in title 8 and title 9 of this code.
(Ord. 295-25, 7-17-2025)
10-5-8: SEWERAGE OR SEPTIC FACILITIES:
All references in this section to "R317" are to the rule R317 "water quality"
of the Utah administrative code, as revised.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General Requirements: The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the city public works standards. If no
sewer facilities are available, the subdivider will be required to provide
them, capping them off until sewer is available. Sanitary sewerage facilities
shall connect with the public sanitary sewerage system. Sewers shall be
installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by the state
department of environmental quality. No individual disposal system or treatment
plants (private or group disposal systems) shall be permitted in areas where
sewer is provided. All sewer lines must be extended across the entire frontage
of all existing streets and to the boundary of the subdivision on all existing
or proposed streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Scope: A plat of the subdivision shall be submitted to the city for
review and shall be drawn to such a scale as needed to show essential features.
Ground surface contours must be included, preferably at one foot (1')
intervals, unless smaller intervals are necessary to describe existing surface
conditions. Intervals larger than two feet (2') must be authorized by the city
on a case by case basis where it can be shown that they are adequate to
describe all necessary terrain features. A vicinity location map, preferably a
U.S. geological survey seven and one-half (71/2) or fifteen (15) minute
topography map, shall be provided with the plat for ease in locating the
subdivision area. A narrative feasibility report addressing the short range and
long range water supply and wastewater disposal facilities proposed to serve
the development must be submitted for review.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Feasibility Report: The feasibility report shall include the following
information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Name and location of proposed plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Name and address of the developer of the proposed project and the
engineer who submitted the feasibility report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Statement of intended use of proposed plat, such as residential
single-family, two-family, commercial, or agricultural.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The proposed street and lot layout, the size and dimensions of each
lot and the location of all water lines and easements, and the proposed sewage
disposal easements. All lots shall be consecutively numbered. The minimum
required area of each lot shall be sufficient to permit the safe and effective
use of an individual wastewater disposal system and shall comply with R317-502-
16. Replacement area for absorption systems on each lot shall conform with the
requirements of R317-502-15. Plats used for multiple dwellings, commercial and
industrial purposes will require a study of anticipated sewage flows prior to
developing suitable area requirements for sewage disposal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Ground surface slope of areas proposed for individual wastewater
disposal systems shall conform with the requirements of R317-502-17.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The location, type and depth of all existing and proposed nonpublic
water supply sources within two hundred feet (200') of individual wastewater
disposal systems, and of all existing or proposed public water supply sources
within one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') of individual wastewater
disposal systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The location of all rivers, streams, creeks, washes (dry or
ephemeral), lakes, canals, ditches, marshes, subsurface drains, natural
stormwater drains, lagoons, artificial impoundments, either existing or
proposed, within or adjacent to the area to be platted, and cutting or filling
of lots that will affect building sites. Areas proposed for individual
wastewater disposal systems shall be isolated from pertinent ground features as
specified.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Surface drainage systems shall be included on the plat, as naturally
occurring, and as altered by roadways, or any drainage, grading, or
improvements, installed or proposed by the developer. The details of the
surface drainage system shall show that the surface drainage structures,
whether pipes or culverts, will be adequate to handle all surface drainage so
that it in no way will affect individual wastewater disposal systems on the
property. Details shall also be provided for the final disposal of surface
runoff from the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â If any part of a subdivision lies within or abuts a floodplain area,
the floodplain shall be shown with contour lines and elevations and shall be
clearly labeled on the plat with the words "floodplain area".
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â All soil exploration pits and percolation test holes shall be
located on the subdivision plat and identified by a key number or letter
designation. All soil tests shall be conducted at the owner's expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â A report by an engineer, geologist or other person qualified by
training and experience to prepare such reports must be submitted to show a
comprehensive log of soil conditions throughout the project area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A sufficient number of soil exploration pits shall be dug
(preferably with a backhoe) on the property to provide an accurate description
of subsurface soil conditions. Soil description should conform with the unified
soil classification system. Soil exploration pits shall be of sufficient size
to permit visual inspection, and to a minimum depth of ten feet (10'), and at
least four feet (4') below the bottom of proposed absorption systems. One end
of each pit should be sloped gently to permit easy entry if necessary. Deeper
soil exploration pits are required if deep absorption systems, such as seepage
trenches, are proposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â For each soil exploration pit, a log of the subsurface formations
encountered must be submitted for review which describes the texture, structure
and depth of each soil type, the depth of the groundwater table if encountered,
and any indications of the maximum groundwater table.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Soil exploration pits shall be made at the approximate rate of
one test per two (2) acres, or one test per one lot if lots are larger than
three (3) acres. If soil conditions and surface topography indicate, a greater
or lesser number of soil exploration pits may be required by the regulatory
authority. Whenever available, information from published soil studies of the
area of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted for review. Soil
exploration pits must be conducted as closely as possible to the sites on the
lots or parcels proposed for absorption systems, and shall be distributed as
uniformly as possible over the property such that no significant areas remain
untested. The regulatory authority shall have the option of inspecting the open
soil exploration pits. Complete results shall be submitted to the city engineer
for review, including all unacceptable test results. Absorption systems are not
permitted in areas where the requirements of R317-503 cannot be met. Where soil
and other site conditions are clearly unsuitable, there is no need for
conducting soil exploration pits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â A statement by an engineer, geologist or other person qualified by
training and experience to prepare such statements, must be submitted
indicating the present and maximum groundwater table throughout the
development. If there is evidence that the groundwater table ever rises to less
than two feet (2') from the bottom of the proposed absorption systems, or to
less than four feet (4') from finished grade, individual wastewater absorption
systems will not be approved. Groundwater table determinations must be made in
accordance with R317-203-2.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â An adequate number of percolation tests shall be conducted on the
development property to determine the permeability of the soils for absorption
systems. All percolation tests shall be conducted in accordance with the
procedures specified in R317-503-4. Such tests shall be made at the approximate
rate of one test per two (2) acres, or one test per one lot if lots are larger
than three (3) acres. If soil conditions and surface topography indicate, a
greater or lesser number of percolation tests may be required by the regulatory
authority. Percolation tests must be performed as closely as possible to the
sites on the lots of parcels proposed for absorption systems, and shall be
distributed as uniformly as possible over the property such that no significant
areas remain untested. Where questionable soil conditions exist, the regulatory
authority shall have the option of monitoring the percolation test procedure.
Complete results shall be submitted to the city engineer for review, including
all unacceptable test results. Absorption systems are not permitted in areas
where the soil percolation rate is slower than sixty (60) minutes per inch, or
faster than one minute per inch. Where soil and other site conditions are
clearly unsuitable, there is no need for conducting percolation tests.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â If ground surface slopes exceed about four percent (4%), or if soil
conditions, drainage channels, ditches, ponds or watercourses are located in or
near the project so as to complicate design and location of individual
wastewater disposal system, a detailed disposal system layout shall be provided
for those lots presenting the greatest design difficulty. A typical lot layout
will include, but not be limited to, the following information, and shall be
drawn to scale:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All critical dimensions and distances for the selected lot,
including the distance of the individual wastewater disposal system from
rivers, lakes, ditches, ponds, watercourses, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Location of dwelling, with distances from street and property
lines. Portion of lot to be irrigated with pressurized, culinary water and any
special landscape areas. (See title 9 chapter 25 Waterwise Landscape).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Location of water lines, water supply, individual wastewater
disposal system, property lines and lot easements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Capacity of septic tank and dimensions and cross section of
absorption system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Results and locations of individual soil exploration pits and
percolation tests conducted on the selected lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â If nonpublic wells or springs are to be provided, the plat shall
show a typical lot layout indicating the relative location of the building,
well or spring, and individual wastewater absorption system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â If proposed developments are located in aquifer recharge areas or
areas of other particular geologic concern, the regulatory authority may
require such additional information relative to groundwater movement, or
possible subsurface sewage flow as may be necessary to determine that adequate
protection against contamination of any existing or proposed water supply
source will be provided, and that no pollution of the waters of the state will
occur.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â After review of all information, plans and proposals, the
regulatory authority will send a letter to the individual who submitted the
feasibility report stating the results of the review or the need for additional
information. An affirmative statement of feasibility does not imply that it
will be possible to install individual wastewater disposal systems on all of
the proposed lots, but shall mean that such disposal systems may be installed
on the majority of the proposed lots in accordance with minimum state
requirements and any conditions that may be imposed.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial
or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land
shall make such provisions as the planning commission may require.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the
requirements of site plan approval set forth in the zoning title. Site plan
approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed
simultaneously at the discretion of the planning commission. A nonresidential
subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations, as
well as such additional standards required by the planning commission, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the general
plan, transportation element and zoning title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Standards: In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission that
the street, parcel and block pattern proposed are specifically adapted to the
uses anticipated and take into account other uses in the vicinity. The
following principles and standards shall be observed:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions
to the types of industrial development anticipated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Street right of way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including, but not limited to, water, sewer

TITLE 11
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
SECTION:
11-1-1: Statutory Authorization
11-1-2: Findings Of Fact
11-1-3: Purpose
11-1-4: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
11-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
As a municipality the city of Uintah is specifically authorized by Utah code
section 10-3-701 to promote the health, safety and welfare of its citizens
through the exercise of its legislative powers by ordinance. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-
2015)
11-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the city of Uintah are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
11-1-3: PURPOSE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Protect human life and health;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
11-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In order to accomplish its purposes, this title uses the following
methods:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
CHAPTER 2
DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
11-2-1: General Definitions
11-2-1: GENERAL DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
title its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B,
C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a
building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of
the water; and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case
of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building", also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building",
even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the
breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the national flood
insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance erosion control ordinance) and other
applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of the interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1. By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2. Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or continuous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: Means, for purposes of the national flood insurance program,
the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Built on a single chassis;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition should equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this title
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this title. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)

chapter 5 of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, and AH, on the community's FIRM which increases
the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'),
provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision
through FEMA (conditional letter of map revision). (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
11-4-3: PERMIT PROCEDURES:

transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
11-4-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearing And Decisions For Variances: The appeal authority as
established by the community shall hear and render judgement on requests for
variances from the requirements of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Hear And Decide Appeals: The appeal authority shall hear and render
judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in
the enforcement or administration of this title.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Appeals: Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal
authority may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Records; Reporting: The floodplain administrator shall maintain a
record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the
federal emergency management agency upon request.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Historic Structures: Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of
historic places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Lot Size: Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 11-4-3B of
this chapter has been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Conditions: Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the
intent of this section, the appeal authority may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this title (section
11-1-3 of this title).
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Floodways: Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Preservation Of Historic Structures: Variances may be issued for the
repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Showing a good and sufficient cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Variances Issued: Variances may be issued by a community for new
construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary
for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are
met; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
has been provided as set forth in section
11-3-2 and subsections 11-4-2A8 of this title and subsection 11-5-3C of this
chapter, the following provisions are required:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as

above grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Manufactured Homes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on
a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 1)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of this subsection A4 be elevated so that either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to
an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Meet the permit requirements of subsection 11-4-3A of this title,
and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in
subsection A4 of this section.

jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 226-15,
4-7-2015)
11-5-3: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections
11-1-2,
11-1-3 and
11-1-4 of this title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
11-3-3 and
11-4-3 of this title; and the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section
11-3-2 or subsection 11-4-2A8 of this title.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home

11-5-4: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
11-3-2 of this title, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evidence. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection 11-4-3A1 of this title, are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures. (Ord. 226-15, 4-7-2015)
