meeting that the nomination will be considered and will place that item on the
agenda posted for the meeting. The one week notification may be waived at the
nominating party's option in order to accommodate last minute submittals;
      3.   The historic preservation commission will review the documentation
for completeness, accuracy and compliance with the criteria for designating
historic properties to the city historic sites list and will make its decision
accordingly.
   C.   Results Of Designation To Historic Sites List:
      1.   Owners of officially designated historic sites may obtain a historic
site certificate from the historic preservation commission. The certificate

commission, which will take responsibility for the documentation;
         b.   Documentation will include, at minimum, exterior photographs
(both black and white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic
building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the
building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor plan drawing of the
building;
         c.   The demolition permit will be issued after thirty (30) days of

review and consideration by the historic preservation commission. (Ord. 2002-
003, 2002)
2.66.050: CITY HISTORIC LANDMARK REGISTER:
Significant historic properties may be designated to the historic landmark
register for the purposes of recognizing their significance and providing
incentives and guidelines for their preservation.
   A.   Criteria For Designating Properties To City Historic Landmark Register:
Any district, building, structure, object or site may be designated to the
historic landmark register if it meets the criteria outlined below:
      1.   Location: It is located within the official boundaries of the city;

distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
               (D)   Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
important in prehistory or history (archaeological sites, for example);
         c.   It has been documented according to the state historic
preservation office standards for intensive level surveys (June 1993 version,
or subsequent revisions) or national register standards and a copy of that
documentation has been placed in the local historic preservation files;
      3.   Owner Approval:
         a.   Individual Properties: The owner of the property must approve the
action to designate his/her property to the historic landmark register by
submitting to the historic preservation commission a written statement to that
effect;
         b.   Historic Districts: A majority (over 50 percent) of the property
owners in a proposed historic district must be in favor of the designation or
at least not opposed to it. Written objections from over fifty percent (50%) of
the property owners will constitute lack of approval and will halt the
designation process.
   B.   Designation Procedures:
      1.   Initiation: Submittal to the historic preservation commission of a
complete intensive level survey or National Register of Historic Places
documentation shall initiate the review process;
      2.   Hearing; Notice: The historic preservation commission shall place
properly submitted nominations on the agenda for its next scheduled meeting and
shall notify the nominating party and the property owner, either orally or in
writing, fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting that the nomination will be

proposed nominations may be made by public notice placed in the local newspaper
or posted in a public building;
      3.   Review: The historic preservation commission shall review the
documentation for completeness, accuracy and compliance with the criteria for
designating properties to the city historic landmark register and may, by
passage of an appropriate resolution, designate properties to the historic
landmark register.
   C.   Notification And Recording Of Designation: Following designation by the
historic preservation commission, a notice of such shall be mailed to the
owners of record, together with a copy of this chapter. In the case of historic
district designation, notice of such may be placed in the local newspaper or in
a public building rather than mailed to each owner of property in the district.
The historic preservation commission shall record the historic landmark
register status designation with the county recorder's office.
   D.   Results Of Designation To Historic Landmark Register:
      1.   Special Consideration: Properties designated to the historic
landmark register may receive special consideration in the granting of zoning
variances or conditional use permits in order to encourage their preservation;
      2.   Rehabilitation: In the event of rehabilitation of the property,
local building officials will consider waiving certain code requirements in
accordance with the building code, which deals with historic buildings, and the
uniform code for building conservation, a special code for existing buildings;
      3.   Grant Assistance: Owners of historic landmarks may seek assistance
from the historic preservation commission in applying for grants or tax credits
for rehabilitating their properties;
      4.   Review Of Exterior Work: Proposed exterior work on historic
landmarks is subject to the review and approval of the historic preservation
commission. The purpose of this review is to ensure the preservation of
historic properties to the greatest degree possible. This review applies to
individually designated landmark properties or any property, contributing or
noncontributing, located in a landmark designated historic district. This
review applies only to exterior work which requires a building permit, sign
permit or demolition permit:
         a.   Applications for building, demolition or sign permits pertaining
to building or demolition shall be forwarded by the building inspection
department to the historic preservation commission prior to their issuance;
         b.   A permit applicant, in order to obtain a permit from the building
inspection division, shall file a request for a certificate of appropriateness
with the historic preservation commission on a form furnished by that
commission;
         c.   At its next scheduled meeting, the historic preservation
commission shall review the application and proposed work for compliance with
the standards for rehabilitation, hereafter referred to as the "standards", and
any design guidelines adopted by the historic preservation commission and city
council;
            (1)   Applicants whose proposed projects comply with the provisions
of this chapter shall be issued a "certificate of historic appropriateness"
within ten (10) days, which authorizes the issuance of the appropriate permit;
            (2)   Applicants whose proposed projects are found to be in
noncompliance with this chapter shall be offered a negotiating period of sixty
(60) days, during which time the commission and applicant shall explore all
options for an acceptable solution. These may include the feasibility of
modifying the plans, using the historic landmark for alternative purposes, and
reselling the property to another party. The commission may extend the
negotiating period an additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described
above if deemed necessary to accommodate a potential solution;
            (3)   If no solution has been agreed upon at the conclusion of
either the initial sixty (60) day period or the full one hundred twenty (120)
day period, the certificate of historic appropriateness will be denied;
consequently, the building official shall not issue any permits;
         d.   The historic preservation commission may approve a certificate of
appropriateness for rehabilitation or demolition of a landmark property if the
owner has presented substantial evidence demonstrating that unreasonable
economic hardship will result from denial of the certificate of
appropriateness:
            (1)   In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic
hardship, the historic preservation commission may require the owner to provide
information to whether the property is capable of producing a reasonable return
for the owner;
            (2)   Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be
based on conditions resulting from willful or negligent acts by the owner,
purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of
purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to
diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant
improvements;
      5.   Appeal: An applicant who has been denied any permit by the building
official, based on the historic preservation commission's refusal to issue a
certificate of historic appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the city
council. The appeal must be made on or before thirty (30) days after the
commission's decision.
   E.   Removal Of Properties From Historic Landmark Register: Properties
which, in the opinion of the historic preservation commission, no longer meet
the criteria for eligibility may be removed from the historic landmark register
after review and consideration by the historic preservation commission.
   F.   Enforcement: The provisions of this section are subject to the
enforcement provisions established in the building code, code for building
conservation, or in the housing code as adopted by the city. (Ord. 2002-003,
2002)
2.66.060: STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND DESIGN GUIDELINES:
The following standards and guidelines shall be used by the historic
preservation commission in determining the historic appropriateness of any
application pertaining to historic landmark properties. This includes
individually designated landmark properties and both contributing and
noncontributing properties in landmark designated historic districts. In
approving an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic
preservation commission shall find that the project substantially complies will
all of the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application
and that the decision is in the best interest of the city:
   A.   Standards For Rehabilitation: These standards are based on the
secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation, which serve as a
national and state model for appropriate preservation treatment. The standards
are as follows:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment;
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      5.   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved;
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence;
      7.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
      8.   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
      9.   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment;
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   B.   General Design Guidelines; Landmark Buildings And Contributing
Buildings In Landmark Designated Historic Districts:
      1.   Avoid demolition of landmark and contributing buildings. They are a
finite resource and cannot be replaced;
      2.   Vacant buildings should be weather and vandal proofed in order to
minimize further deterioration and the threat to public safety;
      3.   Rehabilitation work, especially on the exterior and the principal
facade, should preserve existing historic features or replace them if
absolutely necessary with features and materials known to have existed on the
building. Avoid dressing up buildings by adding features based on speculation;
      4.   Avoid moving buildings whenever possible, especially to create
artificial groupings of historic buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new
site should be similar to the original site, and the original setback and
orientation of the building on the lot should be replicated.
   C.   Additions To Landmark And Contributing Buildings And Construction Of
New Buildings Within Historic District:
      1.   New additions to landmark and contributing buildings should be
subordinate to the original building, lower in height, attached to the rear or
set back along the side, and subordinate in scale and architectural detailing;
      2.   Height, width, setback, roof shape and the overall scale and massing
of new buildings should be compatible with surrounding historic buildings and
the overall streetscape;
      3.   Materials on at least the primary facade should be similar to
original materials on facades of surrounding historic buildings (usually brick,
stucco, stone or wood siding, depending on the specific characteristics of the
district);
      4.   Architectural details (including wood or metal trim, porches,
cornices, arches, window and door features, etc.) should not replicate historic
features on surrounding historic buildings;
      5.   Window and door openings should be similar in size and orientation
(vertical or horizontal) to openings on historic buildings and should take up
about the same percentage of the overall facade as those on surrounding
historic buildings;
      6.   The relationship of the width to the height of the principal
elevations shall be in scale with surrounding structures and streetscape. Wider
new buildings can be divided into segments that more closely resemble the
facade widths of historic buildings;
      7.   The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the
surrounding structures and streetscape. Unusual roof shapes, pitches and colors
are discouraged. (Ord. 2002-003, 2002)

testing. Based on circumstances of the accident or unsafe act, the supervisor
may initiate testing when such circumstances involve:
            (1)   A death or personal injury requiring immediate
hospitalization;
            (2)   Damage to city premises and/or property in excess of two
hundred dollars ($200.00).

performance, must report to his/her immediate supervisor, and/or city safety
director such drug use and the possible effects. If the immediate supervisor,
and/or the safety director, utilizing medical advice where appropriate,
determines that the employee poses a threat to his/her own safety or to the
safety of coworkers, or that the employee's job performance may be
significantly affected by the legal drug, the employee must accept assignment
to appropriate alternate or limited duties, if available, or to take a medical
leave of absence.
      3.   Illegal Drugs: The presence of any illegal drug in an employee while
performing city business or while on city premises is prohibited. The use,
sale, purchase, transfer or possession of an illegal drug by any employee while
on city premises or while performing city business is prohibited.
   C.   Employee Reporting Requirements: As a condition of employment in any
federal grant, each employee who is engaged either directly or indirectly in
performance of a federal grant shall abide by the terms of this policy and
shall notify his/her supervisor in writing of his/her conviction of any
criminal drug and/or alcohol statute for a violation occurring in any of the
places listed above on which work on city federal grant is performed, no later
than five (5) calendar days after such conviction.

3.20.030: HEARING OF PROTESTS:
   A.   At the first regular meeting of the city council after the time fixed
in the notice of intention for filing of protests with the city recorder, the

improvements, it shall make an order, which shall be entered of record upon the
minutes of its proceedings, authorizing and directing the work to be done and
the improvements made upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Prior code § 3-1-3)
3.20.040: BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND REVIEW; APPOINTMENT REQUIRED; POWER TO HOLD
HEARINGS AND DETERMINE TAX:
   A.   Whenever the city council proposes to levy any tax under the provisions
of this chapter, it shall, before doing so, appoint a board of equalization and
review. The board shall consist of three (3) or more of its members.
   B.   The board of equalization and review shall, upon completion of the
lists of the property in any of the districts taxed, give public notice of the
completion of such lists and of its intention to hold public hearings relating
to the proposed levy.
   C.   Such notice shall be published one or more times at least twenty (20)
and not more than thirty five (35) days prior to the date the board will begin
its hearings thereon, in a newspaper published in the city. The notice shall
contain the time and place that the board will begin its hearings thereon, and
may, at the discretion of the board, set out the maximum amount of the proposed
assessments.
   D.   In addition to such publication, the board shall, not later than ten
(10) days after the first publication of notice, mail a copy of such notice,
postage prepaid, to each owner of land to be assessed within the proposed
special improvement district. The notice shall be mailed to the last known
address of such owner, using for such purpose the names and addresses appearing
on the last completed real property assessment rolls of the county wherein the
affected property is located. In addition, a copy of such notice shall be
addressed to "owner", and be so mailed, addressed to the street number of each
piece of improved property to be affected by the assessment.
   E.   The board shall convene at the time and place specified in the notice,
and hold public meetings during usual business hours for not less than three
(3) consecutive days. The first meeting of the board may be adjourned or
recessed from time to time to a specific place and a specific hour and day
until the work of the board shall have been completed. At the meeting, the
board shall hear any person who believes himself to be aggrieved.
   F.   After the board hearings have been completed, the board may consider
the facts and arguments presented, and shall have authority to make such
corrections in any proposed assessment as it may consider just and equitable.
Such corrections may eliminate one or more pieces of property, or may increase
or decrease the amount of the special taxes proposed to be assessed against any
piece of property.
   G.   In the event the corrections result in an increase of any proposed
assessment, the board, before approving the corrected assessment list, shall
mail to each owner of land whose assessment is to be increased, a notice
stating that the assessment will be increased, the amount of the proposed
assessment, that a hearing will be held at which they may appear and make any
objections to the increase, and the time and place of the hearing. The notice
shall be mailed to the last known address of the owner, using for such purposes
the names and addresses appearing on the last completed real property
assessment rolls of the county where the affected property is located, and in
addition, a copy of the notice shall be addressed to "owner", and be so mailed,
addressed to the street number of each piece of improved property to be
affected by the assessment. Such notice shall be mailed at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date stated in the notice for the holding of such hearing.

date of hearing, the lists shall be open to public inspection. After having
concluded the public hearings, the board shall make a report to the body
appointing it of any changes or corrections made by it in the assessment list,
together with its finding that each piece of property within the special
improvement district will be benefited in an amount not less than the
assessment to be levied against such property.
   I.   Upon receipt of the report from the board, the city council may proceed
with the levying of such tax.
   J.   Every person whose property is subject to the assessment and who fails
to appear before the board of equalization and review to raise his objections
to the levy of such tax, shall be deemed to have waived all objection to such
levy, except the objection that the city council failed to obtain jurisdiction
to order the making of the improvements which the tax levy is intended to pay.
(Prior code § 3-1-4)
3.20.050: COMPLETION OF WORK; ENGINEER CERTIFICATE REQUIRED:
Whenever the city engineer issues a certificate covering a portion or all of
the work completed in any improvement district, he shall transmit a copy of the
certificate, together with a plat of the property affronted, to the city
treasurer; and immediately upon receipt of the copy and plat, the city
treasurer shall cause to be made an accurate list of the property affected; and
immediately upon the completion of the assessment list, the city treasurer
shall file a true copy thereof with the city recorder, who shall thereupon
notify the board of equalization and review that the assessment list has been

3.20.060: TIME WHEN TAX LEVIED; COST OF WORK; WARRANTS ISSUED TO CONTRACTOR
WHEN:
   A.   Special taxes may be levied as the improvements are completed in front
of or along or upon any block or lot, or part thereof, or pieces of ground, or
at the time the improvement is entirely completed, or when light service or
park maintenance is commenced, as shall be provided in the ordinance levying
the tax; provided, that before any special tax for special improvements shall
be levied, the cost of such improvements in the improvement district, or part
thereof, named in the notice of intention to make such improvement, shall be
ascertained by contract duly let to the lowest responsible bidder, for the kind
of service or material or form of construction which may be determined upon by
the city council after the opening of bids, and after publication of notice to
contractors at least one time in a newspaper having general circulation in the
city at least fifteen (15) days before the date specified in the notice for the
receipt of bids. Such notice may be published simultaneously with the notice of
intention, and the cost of such improvement shall not exceed to the property
owner his proportion of the total cost of the improvement determined as
provided in section
3.20.070 of this chapter. The city council has the right to reject any and all
bids.
   B.   Where any improvement in any extension varies as to character, width,
extent or otherwise, the property fronting, abutting upon or adjacent to the
street improved may be assessed at varying rates in accordance with the
character, width or extent of the improvement upon that portion of the street
immediately abutting or adjacent to the property.
   C.   There may be included in any contract for work in such district any one
or more of the improvements provided for in this chapter. Where assessment is
levied for the cost of opening, widening or extending streets or alleys, the
purchase or condemnation price of the land shall be deemed the contract price,
and notice to contractors may be dispensed with.
   D.   The city council may, from time to time as work proceeds in any
improvement district pursuant to contract duly entered into, issue to the
contractor interim warrants against the improvement district for not to exceed
ninety percent (90%) in value of the work theretofore done upon estimates of
the city engineer, which warrants shall bear interest at not to exceed six
percent (6%) per year from date of issue until fifteen (15) days after levy of
assessment. The interest accruing on such warrants shall be included in the
cost of the improvement.
   E.   Such interim warrants and interest shall be taken up and paid by
special improvement warrants or special improvement bonds issued upon
completion of the work, or in cash received from the payment of assessments, or
from any or all of such sources. (Prior code § 3-1-6)
3.20.070: BASIS OF ASSESSMENT; PAYMENTS AND DELINQUENT PAYMENTS:
   A.   The assessment of special taxes for special improvements shall be made
as follows: That part of the cost of engineering, inspection, publishing and
mailing notice, making the tax levy, and any incidental costs upon any such
improvement above ten percent (10%) of the contract price of such improvement
shall be paid out of the general funds of the city. The total cost of the
improvement, which shall include the cost of acquisition of any real property
involved, the interest on interim warrants and the total contract price, plus
an amount equal to but not exceeding ten percent (10%) thereof to cover the
actual cost of engineering, inspection, publishing and mailing notice and
making the levy, shall be levied at one time upon the property, and shall
become due in not more than ten (10) equal annual installments, as may be
provided in the ordinance levying the tax, with interest on the whole sum
unpaid at not to exceed seven percent (7%) per year until due, and thereafter
at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year until paid, payable semiannually or
annually, as provided in the ordinance; provided, that where the assessment is
for light service or park maintenance, interest shall be charged only from and
after the due date of each installment, which date for the first installment
shall be fifteen (15) days after the date on which the levy becomes effective.
One or more of such installments, in the order payable, or the whole tax, may
be paid without interest within fifteen (15) days after such ordinance becomes
effective.
   B.   All sums so collected shall be paid to the contractor having the
contract to make the improvement, to pay for which such tax is levied or the
cost of the acquisition of any real property involved, or to pay interim
warrants, or for both such purposes, less not exceeding ten percent (10%) to be
retained by the city on account of levying, engineering, inspecting, publishing
notices, and other expenses by the city incident to such improvement and the
levy and collection of such tax.
   C.   All unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of
property may (but only in their entirety) be paid prior to the dates on which
they become due, but any such prepayment must include an additional amount
equal to the interest which would accrue on the assessment to the next
succeeding date on which interest is payable on the warrants or bonds issued in
anticipation of the collection of the assessments, plus such additional amount
as, in the opinion of the city council or of any officer of the city designated
by the city council, is necessary to assure the availability of money to pay
interest on the warrants or bonds as interest becomes due and any premiums
which may become payable on redeemable warrants or bonds which may be called in
order to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance.
   D.   Default in the payment of any such installment of principal or interest
when due shall cause the whole of the unpaid principal or interest to become
due and payable immediately, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal shall
thereafter draw interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year until paid;
but at any time prior to the date of sale or foreclosure, the owner may pay the
amount of all unpaid installments past due, with interest at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per year to date of payment on the delinquent installments, and
all accrued costs, and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to
pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not occurred.
   E.   In case any such tax becomes or has become delinquent, and the property
subject thereto has been or shall be sold to the city therefor, no redemption
of such property shall be permitted except upon payment of the full amount due,
interest and taxes paid by the city, and accrued costs and redemption fees,
unless in the judgment of the city council the interest of the city will be
subserved by accepting a less sum in settlement therefor.
   F.   After sale, if tax sale certificates thereon have issued to the city,
the city may provide by ordinance for payment in installments of unpaid
principal, interest and all costs and charges, and for giving credit for the
amount so paid against the amounts so due; provided, that the installment shall
be in such amount as will discharge the indebtedness within not more than the
period in which the right to redeem from such tax sale shall expire.
   G.   Credit shall be given for each installment as paid, and interest
thereby reduced proportionally, and on all unpaid installments interest shall
be paid and charged at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year.
   H.   In case any owner electing to take advantage of the provisions of such
ordinance fails to make payment of such installments when due, the right of the
city to receive a tax deed for such real estate shall not be impaired, nor
shall the owner be entitled to receive any refund of any amounts so paid. Such
ordinance may also provide for the payment with each installment of a sum, not
exceeding one dollar ($1.00) per installment, to cover the additional
bookkeeping expense incurred in connection therewith, and not to be credited
against the delinquent tax.
   I.   In case of deficiencies, omissions, errors or mistakes in making such
assessment or levy in respect to the total cost of the improvement, the city
council shall make a supplemental assessment and levy to supply such
deficiencies, omissions, errors or mistakes. (Prior code § 3-1-7)
3.20.080: SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT WARRANTS OR BONDS; ISSUANCE CONDITIONS:
   A.   Fifteen (15) days or more after the levy of a special tax or assessment
for the purpose of making or paying for any local improvement, the city council
may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the issuance of warrants or bonds in
payment of the cost and expense of such local improvements against the funds
created by such special tax levy or assessment. They shall be known as "special
improvement warrants" or "special improvement bonds", shall be consecutively
numbered, and shall be made in such form, wording and color as the city council
may determine. The bonds shall be in such denomination and shall be payable at
such times and places as the city council shall determine, except that in no
event shall such bonds be payable over a longer period of time than the period
of time over which the installments of the special assessments are due and
payable, plus ninety (90) days.
   B.   All such warrants or bonds shall be dated no earlier than the date on
which the special tax begins to bear interest, and shall bear interest at a
rate not exceeding seven percent (7%) per year from date until due, and at the
rate of eight percent (8%) per year thereafter until paid, except light service
and park maintenance warrants or bonds, which shall bear interest only from and
after the due date thereof. Interest shall be paid semiannually or annually, as
determined by the city council, and may be evidenced by interest coupons
attached to such warrants or bonds signed by the facsimile signature of the
city recorder.
   C.   The city council may provide that such warrants or bonds shall be
callable for redemption prior to maturity, and fix the terms and conditions of
redemption, including the notice to be given and the premium, if any, to be
paid; but no such bonds or warrants shall be callable for redemption unless the
terms and conditions of redemption are stated on the face of the bonds or
warrants. The warrants or bonds shall be signed by a member of the city council
designated by the governing body, and shall be countersigned by the city
recorder and, if so provided by the city council, one of such signatures may be
a facsimile signature.
   D.   Such warrants or bonds may be issued to the contractor doing the work
in any such improvement district for the full amount of the contract price due
at the time of their issuance, including any interest on interim warrants which
may have been issued to him, and to the city in which such work is done and by
which such bonds are issued, for an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of
such contract price, to cover the cost of levying, engineering, inspecting,
publishing notice, and other expenses incident thereto and in payment of
property purchased or condemned for the purpose of opening, extending or
widening streets; provided, the city may, in its discretion, sell all such
warrants or bonds on such terms and conditions as the city, by ordinance or
resolution adopted at a public meeting, may determine, or at a public sale, and
from the proceeds thereof pay any or all of such obligations, including the
contractor, any or all amounts due him. (Prior code § 3-1-8)
3.20.090: EXEMPTIONS; PARKING SPACES AND PARK MAINTENANCE:
The city council may exempt any lot or piece of ground from the levy of the tax
for setting out and planting of lawn, grass and shade trees in parking spaces,
or for park maintenance, when the owner of such property shall, at any time
prior to the execution of the contract for the work, make showing satisfactory
to the city council that he has commenced and will continue to its completion,
to set out and plant such lawn, grass and shade trees in the parking space
abutting his property in accordance with the plan of the city engineer, and
that he will maintain same in good condition thereafter. (Prior code § 3-1-9)

3.34.040: Review Of Decision
3.34.050: Reviewing Guidelines
3.34.060: Results Of Review
3.34.010: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
There is an underlying policy in the city, strongly favoring the careful
consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to
the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty
and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same
time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property
must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction
of property consistent with the constitution must be honored. Consistent with
this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of
actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions
are to assist governments in considering decisions that may involve
constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be
provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is
further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims
by citizens that a specific government action should require payment of just
compensation, yet preserve the ability of the city to lawfully regulate real
property and fulfill its other duties and functions. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.020: CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING DEFINED:
As used in this chapter:
   A.   "Constitutional taking" means actions by the city involving the
physical taking or exaction of private real property that might require
compensations to a private real property owner because of:
      1.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United
States; or
      2.   Article I, section 22, of the Utah constitution; or
      3.   Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of
private real property by a governmental entity.
   B.   Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of
private real property is not a "constitutional taking" if the physical taking
or exaction bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest and,
is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized property
basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development of
the legitimate government interest. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.030: GUIDELINES ADVISORY:
The guidelines adopted and decisions rendered pursuant to the provisions of
this section are advisory, and shall not be construed nor shall they expand or
limit the scope of the city's liability for a constitutional taking. The
reviewing body or person shall not be required to make any determination under
this chapter except pursuant to section
3.34.040 of this chapter. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.040: REVIEW OF DECISION:

with the city attorney.
   C.   The city council, or an individual, or body designed by the city
council, shall immediately set a time to review the decision that gave rise to

the reviewing body/official certifies to the applicant that all the materials
and information required above have been received by the city. The reviewing

bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest;
   B.   Whether a legitimate governmental interest exists for the action taken
by the city;
   C.   Is the property and exaction taken, roughly proportionate and
reasonably related, on an individual property basis, both in nature and extent,
to the impact caused by the activities that are the subject of the decision
being reviewed. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.060: RESULTS OF REVIEW:
After completing the review, the reviewing person/body shall make a
determination regarding the above issues and where determined to be necessary
and appropriate, shall make a recommendation to the officer, employee, board,

an employee of that business owner. The business owner's sales tax
identification number will be used for retail sales.
   I.   Reciprocal Recognition Of Licenses; Deliveries: No license fee or tax
shall be required by the city of any person whose only business activity in the

with or as a part of or in the name of any locally licensed business. The
provisions of this definition shall not apply to sales made for resale
(wholesale merchandising), or to any sales by societies or groups or persons
acting for charity, religious or public purposes. A temporary merchant occupies
a temporary fixed location, selling and delivering from stock on hand, doing
business in much the same manner as a permanent business, the principal
difference being in the temporary nature of the business. Each business license
application must be submitted with a letter/agreement from the owner/landlord
of the property being used stating that the two (2) parties are in agreement as
to the use of such property. (Ord. 2008-001, 2008)

for a license as provided under this title;

      3.   The licensee has violated or is violating any provision of this
title, or provisions of other city ordinances and/or state or federal laws
governing the licensee's business;

license by fraud or deceit;
      5.   The licensee fails to pay licensing fees, including, without
limitation, any penalty imposed for attempting to pay with a check, draft or
financial transaction card that is not honored by the drawee;
      6.   The licensee refuses entry onto the business premises by authorized
representatives of the city to make an inspection or has interfered with such
representatives while making an inspection;
      7.   The licensee is not complying with a requirement or condition set by
the city;
      8.   Violation of city, state or federal laws by the agents or employees
of a licensee that are deemed to negatively impact the health, safety or
welfare of the inhabitants of city;
      9.   Any other reason provided for in this title.
   B.   Penalty: Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be
guilty of a class B misdemeanor, as defined by state law. Each day a holder of
a business license violates any provision of this chapter shall be deemed a
separate violation.
   C.   Expiration Date Of Licenses: All licenses, excluding temporary licenses
which expire as indicated on the certificate of license, shall expire on
December 31.
   D.   Filing Of Complaints: It shall be the duty of the city license

         c.   After sixty (60) days' delinquency, the city license
administrator shall not accept a reissuance application for a license which has
expired, or for which any other reason is not in full force and effect.
Applicants shall be required to file an application for a new business license
and pay all new business license fees and any past due licensing fees and/or
penalties prior to issuance of a new license.
      3.   Imposition of late payment penalties is in addition to and not in
lieu of any legal remedy available to the city to enforce this title. Payment
of a late payment penalty is not a defense to a violation of this title.
   F.   Final Notice; Remedy: In February of each year, a final notice shall be
sent to all licensees whose annual license fee remains unpaid. This notice
shall state that unless the fee and any accrued penalties are paid within ten
(10) days, legal action will be initiated by the city attorney for engaging in
business without a valid business license.
   G.   Enforcement Remedies Not Exclusive:
      1.   Conducting business without a license is a continuing violation and
each day of operation without a business license constitutes a separate offense
for which the city may pursue any or all legal remedies available under this
title or state law.
      2.   The city may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, take
other appropriate legal action to enforce the provisions of this title.
      3.   The election to pursue any particular remedy provided by law does
not prevent the city from pursuing any other remedy, civil or criminal, as to

this title. (Ord. 2008-001, 2008)

The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or
otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.

rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city
officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and
property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens
regarding door to door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement
officers and those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as
well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional
protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door to door
solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city's substantial
interests in:

residences;
      2.   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
      3.   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
      4.   Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation
regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.

this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests
referred to herein, while at the same time balancing the rights of those
regulated. (Ord. 2006-001, 2006)

otherwise exempt from registration.

provider, unless such documents are determined by a court of law to constitute
"public records" within the meaning of the Utah government records access and
management act. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)
5.32.040: REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN ELECTRONIC DATABASE OR ENHANCED ZIP CODE
LISTING:
   A.   Electronic Database:
      1.   Provision Of Database: The state may provide an electronic database
to a home service provider; or, if the state does not provide such an
electronic database, the designated database provider may choose to provide an
electronic database to a home service provider.
      2.   Format:
         a.   Such electronic database, whether provided by the state or the
designated database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the
American National Standards Institute accredited standards committee X12,
which, allowing for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address
in the city, including, to the extent practicable, any multiple postal street
addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing
jurisdictions, appropriate code identified by one nationwide standard numeric
code.
         b.   Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code
for each street address with respect to political subdivisions that are not
taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing
jurisdiction.
         c.   The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same
number of numeric digits, with each digit or combination of digits referring to

successors. Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.
   B.   Notice; Updates: The state or designated database provider that
provides or maintains an electronic database described above shall provide
notice of the availability of the then current electronic database and any
subsequent revisions thereof, by publication in the manner normally employed
for the publication of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers
in such state.
   C.   User Held Harmless: A home service provider using the data contained in
an electronic database described above shall be held harmless from any tax,
charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any
error or omission in such database provided by the city or a designated
database provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such
database during a calendar quarter, not later than thirty (30) days after the
end of such calendar quarter the state has issued notice of the availability of
an electronic database reflecting such changes under subsection B of this
section.
   D.   Procedure If No Electronic Database Provided:
      1.   Safe Harbor: If neither the state nor the designated database
provider provides an electronic database, a home service provider shall be held
harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the city that otherwise
would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an
incorrect taxing jurisdiction, if the home service provider employs an enhanced
zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction and
exercises due diligence to ensure that each such street address is assigned to
the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of
taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must
designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in
taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code. Any enhanced zip code
assignment changed is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For
purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service
provider has exercised due diligence if the home service provider demonstrates
that it has:
         a.   Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an
appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to
taxing jurisdictions;
         b.   Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to
promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions;
and
         c.   Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to
municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes
in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such
database.
      2.   Termination Of Safe Harbor: Subsection D1 of this section applies to
a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of
subsection D1 of this section with respect to a state for which an electronic
database is not provided, until the later of:
         a.   Eighteen (18) months after the nationwide standard numeric code
has been approved by the federation of tax administrators and the multistate
tax commission; or
         b.   Six (6) months after the state or a designated database provider
in the state provides such database. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)
5.32.050: PLACE OF PRIMARY USE:
   A.   A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining
the customer's place of primary use. Subject to section
5.32.040 of this chapter, and if the home service provider's reliance on
information by its customer is in good faith, a home service provider:
      1.   May rely upon the applicable residential or business street address
supplied by the home service provider's customer;
      2.   Is not liable for any additional taxes, charges or fees based on a
different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges or fees
that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate address under
existing agreements.
   B.   A home service provider may treat the address used by the home service
provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or
agreement in effect two (2) years after the date of amendment to the ordinance
codified herein as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term
of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of
such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing
jurisdiction to which taxes, charges or fees on charges for mobile
telecommunication services are remitted. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)
5.32.060: TAX AGAINST CUSTOMER:
Each customer shall accurately report the customer's place of primary use. The
customer shall be liable for any taxes not paid by the home service provider as
a result of the customer's failure to accurately report the customer's place of
primary use. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)
5.32.070: NONAPPLICATION:
This chapter does not apply to the determination of the taxing situs of:
   A.   Prepaid telephone calling services; or
   B.   Air-ground radio telephone service, as defined in section 22.99 of
title 47 of the code of federal regulations as in effect on June 1, 1999. (Ord.
2000-011, 2000)
5.32.080: IMPLEMENTATION DATE:
If the ordinance codified herein is adopted before January 1, 2001, a home
service provider shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice before being
obligated to collect the tax described in this chapter. After January 1, 2001,
a home service provider shall have a minimum of sixty (60) days' notice before
being obligated to collect the tax described in this chapter. After January 1,
2001, a home service provider shall receive a minimum of sixty (60) days'
notice regarding any changes to this chapter. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)
5.32.090: SEVERABILITY:
If section
5.32.020 of this chapter is for any reason determined to be or is rendered
illegal, invalid or superseded by other lawful authority, including any state
or federal, legislative, regulatory or administrative authority having
jurisdiction thereof, or determined to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
by any court of competent jurisdiction, such section shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision, and such determination shall have
no effect on the validity of any other section; provided, however, upon such
event and in lieu of such tax, there is levied upon every home service provider
a tax equal to six percent (6%) of the annual gross revenue of the home service
provider generated from services and products to customers. (Ord. 2000-011,

ARTICLE I. DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT; SCOPE OF CHAPTER
5.36.010: DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT:
   A.   Findings Regarding Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of way
within the city:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the city;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well
being of the city and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
   B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
   C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
   D.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory
basis, responsive to the community and public interest, and to assure
availability for municipal, educational and community services.
   E.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
      4.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of
the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the city infrastructure;
      6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
      7.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act").
   F.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts the telecommunications
ordinance codified herein pursuant to its power to manage the rights of way,

(Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
ARTICLE III. FRANCHISE REQUIRED
5.36.050: NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE:
The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing
the installation, construction and maintenance of systems in the city rights of
way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is
granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city and
provider. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.060: EVERY PROVIDER MUST OBTAIN:
Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every
provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications
system or providing telecommunications services using the rights of way, and
every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system
or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video
system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer
protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the
city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of
competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular
telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate
the need of an operator of a cable system to obtain a cable franchise, and,
should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system,
the operator must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (Ord. 2000-004,
2000)
5.36.070: NATURE OF GRANT:
A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights of way. A
franchise is only the right to occupy rights of way on a nonexclusive basis for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the
right may not be subdivided, assigned or subleased. A franchise does not excuse
a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements
before collocating its system on the property of others, including the city's
property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from
leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a
franchise. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.080: CURRENT PROVIDERS:
Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting
without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall request issuance of a
franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the effective date hereof.
If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the
course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations
cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the
provisions of section
5.36.460 of this chapter. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.090: NATURE OF FRANCHISE:
The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be
a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair,
maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights of way in
order to provide services. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.100: REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED:
Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider
shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or
licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city
upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.110: TERM:
No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than
five (5) years, or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall be
granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)

charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, ten
dollars ($10.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
   B.   License Tax Fees: The license tax fee, if any, shall be set forth in
the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a license tax fee shall commence
on the completion date.
   C.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as required by the city. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.130: TIMING:
Unless otherwise agreed to in the agreement, all license tax fees shall be paid
on a quarterly basis within thirty (30) days of the last day of the preceding
quarter. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.140: FEE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION:
Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each license tax fee payment
shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was
calculated and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.150: FUTURE COSTS:
A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at the direction of the
city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the
city incurs for the services of third parties (including, but not limited to,
attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider
initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this chapter or a franchise; provided,
however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the
outset of negotiations. In the event the parties are unable to agree, either
party may submit the issue to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules
and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.160: TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS:

use or occupation of the rights of way, the provider shall be responsible for

required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any
other fees payable pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.170: INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS:
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before
the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from
such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes. (Ord.
2000-004, 2000)
5.36.180: NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION:
No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for
additional sums payable. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.190: NOT IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES OR FEES:
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment
except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable
law. By way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to
obtain space on the city owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
(Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.200: CONTINUING OBLIGATION AND HOLDOVER:
In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system
after the term of the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without
limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period
of such continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall
in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as
a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.210: COSTS OF PUBLICATION:

5.36.260: QUALITY:
All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade and removal
of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner using
materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the
FCC or any other agency granted authority by federal law or the FCC to make
such determination, that any part of the system, including, without limitation,
any means used to distribute signals over or within the system, is harmful to
the public health, safety or welfare, or quality of service or reliability,

conditions. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)

private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)

designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it shall be liable for
the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair and restore to its prior
condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the city, any municipal

   A.   Any officer of the police department, in their discretion, upon receipt
of a complaint alleging that a particular dog is a "vicious dog", as defined

tendencies, may initiate proceedings to declare such dog a vicious dog, as set
forth herein.
   B.    Impoundment:
      1.    A dog alleged to be vicious or displaying vicious tendencies may be
seized and impounded if:
         a.   The dog is at large;
         b.   The officer determines that probable cause exists that the dog

animals;

hearing and all appeals. All costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be
paid by the owner if the dog is determined to be vicious. If collection of
expenses is pursued through the court, the city shall file suit and receive a
judgment for all expenses, together with reasonable attorney fees, interest and
court costs. If the dog is not determined to be vicious, all costs of such
impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the city. The dog may be released
upon payment of a bond or surety, in an amount set by the city council.
   C.   Hearing: The officer, or the mayor or chief of police if the dog is to
be destroyed, shall act as the hearing officer and shall conduct a hearing to
determine whether the dog is vicious and what remedial actions are required.
The hearing shall be recorded and shall be informal, provided that hearing
officer shall respect the due process rights of the owner or keeper of the dog.
      1.   Date Of Hearing: The hearing shall be held within five (5) days
after the dog has been impounded or within a reasonable timeframe after the
officer receives a complaint or is otherwise notified of the dog. The parties
may agree to a later date.
      2.   Notice Of Hearing: The person owning, keeping, sheltering or
harboring the dog in question shall be given not less than seventy-two (72)
hours' written notice of the time and place of the hearing. Said notice shall
set forth the description of the dog in question and the basis for the
allegation of viciousness. The notice shall also set forth that if the dog is
determined to be vicious, the owner will be required to register and restrain
it in accordance with this chapter, remove it from the city, or allow it to be
destroyed. The notice shall be served upon any adult residing at the premises
where the dog is located, or may be posted on the premises if no adult is
present to accept service. If there is no known owner or keeper of the dog, and
the dog is not kept at a particular location, the notice shall be posted on the
city's website and the Utah Public Notice Website.
      3.   Evidence And Argument: The owner or keeper of the dog shall be
entitled to present evidence, call witnesses, and submit arguments to the
hearing officer as to whether the dog is vicious, as defined herein, the prior
history and disposition of the dog, and the appropriate remedy or action
regarding the dog.
      4.   Determination Of Viciousness: In determining whether or not a dog
shall be declared a vicious dog, the hearing officer shall consider, as a
mitigating factor, that the actions of the dog were "provoked", as defined in
this chapter, or that the actions of the dog were in defense of human beings or
property and were reasonable and proportionate in relation to the threat to
such human beings or property.
      5.   Order; Registration Required: If, after the hearing, the hearing
officer determines that a dog is "vicious", as defined in this chapter, the
hearing officer shall issue an order with their findings and shall order the
person owning, sheltering, harboring or keeping the dog to license, register,
and keep the dog in compliance with this chapter, remove it from the city, or
to cause it to be destroyed in a humane manner. Such order shall explain the
appeal process set forth herein. The order shall be in writing and shall
immediately be served upon the individual or entity against whom issued in the
same manner as the notice of hearing.
   D.   Destruction Of Dog: An order to destroy a vicious dog shall only issue
after a hearing conducted by the mayor or chief or police, if the hearing
officer finds that the dog poses a threat to the health and safety of people or
property and that the destruction of the dog is reasonably necessary to prevent
such threat. In determining whether the destruction of the dog is reasonably
necessary, the hearing officer shall consider:
      1.   Whether the dog has previously been determined to be vicious;
      2.   Whether the dog caused property damage or severe injury to or death
of a human being or domesticated animal; and
      3.   Whether the owner or keeper of the dog has previously failed to
comply with this chapter or any order issued thereunder.
   E.   Compliance; Order To Show Cause: The owner or keeper of the vicious dog
shall comply with the order of the hearing officer to register and license the
dog, remove the dog from the city, or destroy the dog in a humane way. If the
owner or keeper of the vicious dog does not comply with the order of the
hearing officer within ten (10) days of service, and the owner or keeper has
not appealed the order to the district court, the officer is authorized to
seize and impound the dog. The officer shall set and provide notice of a
hearing before the mayor or chief of police, according to the process set forth
above, during which the owner or keeper of the dog shall show cause for
noncompliance and for why the dog should not be destroyed. If the hearing
officer determines that there is not cause for noncompliance and that the dog
poses a threat to the health and safety of people or property, the hearing
officer shall order that the dog be destroyed by the city in a humane manner.
   F.   Appeal: The order of the hearing officer may be appealed to the
district court. Any such appeal must be filed within ten (10) days after the
order of the hearing officer is served on the owner or keeper of the dog. The
failure to appeal shall waive the owner's or keeper's right to challenge the
decision of the hearing officer. Any appeal shall be on the record of
proceedings and shall be limited to whether the hearing officer abused its
discretion.
   G.   Enforcement: The city may enforce violations of this chapter through
both civil and criminal remedies, either separately or concurrently. The
administrative process set forth herein shall not be construed as a limitation
on the city's right to prosecute violations of this chapter as a criminal
matter. (Ord. 2022-006, 12-14-2022)

political or scientific value.
   B.   In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, exhibition or publicity
indicate that the matter is being commercially exploited by the defendant for
the sake of its prurient appeal, this evidence is probative with respect to the
nature of the matter, and can justify the conclusion that, in the context in
which it is used, the matter has no serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   C.   Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce
expert witness testimony as to whether the material or performance is or is not
harmful to adults or minors, or is or is not pornographic, or as to any element
of the definition of pornographic, including contemporary community standards.

9.32.070: USE OF PROPERTY BY TENANTS FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES:
   A.   If a tenant or occupant of real property uses his property for an
activity for which he or his employee is convicted under any provision of this
chapter, the conviction makes void the lease or other title under which he
holds at the option of the fee owner or any intermediate lessor; and ten (10)
days after the fee owner or any intermediate lessor gives notice in writing to
the tenant or occupant that he is exercising the option, the right of
possession to the property reverts in the person exercising the option. This
option does not arise until all avenues of direct appeal from the conviction
have been exhausted or abandoned by the tenant or occupant, or his employee.
   B.   It is unlawful for a fee owner or intermediate lessor of real property
to knowingly allow his property to be used for the purpose of distributing or
exhibiting pornographic materials, or for pornographic performances, by a
tenant or occupant if the tenant or occupant, or his employee, has been
convicted under any provision of this chapter of an offense occurring on the
same property, and all avenues of direct appeal from the conviction have been
exhausted or abandoned.
      1.   "Allow", under subsection B of this section, means a failure to
exercise the option arising under subsection A of this section within ten (10)
days after the fee owner or lessor receives notice in writing from the city
attorney.
      2.   A wilful violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor, and any fine
assessed, if not paid within thirty (30) days after judgment, shall become a
lien upon the property.
   C.   Any tenant or occupant who receives a notice in writing that the fee
owner or intermediate lessor is exercising the option provided by subsection A
of this section, and who does not quit the premises within ten (10) days after
the giving of that notice, is guilty of a misdemeanor. (Prior code § 10-8-6;
amd. Ord. 1308-80, 1980)
9.32.080: FAILURE TO STOP ILLEGAL USE OF LAND:
   A.   The omission of a landlord or landowner to take reasonable action to
stop the illegal use of his land for prostitution, lewdness, the keeping of
immoral places, or for the exhibition or commercial exploitation of that which
is obscene, and remove the wrongdoer from the premises, after receiving
official notification of such illegal conduct in writing from the county
attorney or city attorney, and where there is probable cause for the landlord
to believe such criminal conduct does exist, is a crime and nuisance
proscribable as set forth herein.
   B.   "Reasonable action", as used in this section, includes the prompt
termination of tenancy and lawful ejectment of the wrongdoer from the premises.
   C.   All civil or criminal fines, damages, costs or penalties levied against
the landlord, landowner or wrongdoer for such illegal activities on the
premises after a violation of this section shall be a lien upon the land and

a term of not less than thirty (30) days, notwithstanding any provisions of
Utah Code Annotated section 77-35-17, as amended.
   B.   Where a defendant has already been convicted once under this section,
each separate further offense is a misdemeanor, punishable by a minimum
mandatory fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), and by
imprisonment, without suspension of sentence in any way, for a term of not less
than thirty (30) days, notwithstanding any provisions of Utah Code Annotated
section 77-35-17, as amended. (Prior code § 10-8-12; amd. Ord. 1308-80, 1980)
9.32.100: LICENSED BUSINESSES EXHIBITING OBSCENE MATERIALS; LICENSE SUSPENSION:
Pursuant to its authority to license and regulate occupations and activities,
as set forth in the Utah Code Annotated, and in accord with its duty to declare
and abate nuisances and protect the public morals, public health and public
welfare, the city enacts the following provisions:
   A.   It is declared that the wilful or knowing public exhibition or
commercial exploitation of that which is lewd or obscene is a serious public
nuisance, and such conduct on the part of any person constitutes an offense of
moral turpitude.
   B.   Any person or other entity licensed to serve or deal with the public,
manifesting such unlawful conduct, shall have his license suspended for a
period of not less than six (6) months, and the license shall not be reinstated
until a thorough character investigation of the person is conducted, the
expense thereof to be borne by the person, up to two hundred ninety nine
dollars ($299.00), and upon the posting of a bond in the amount of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) to ensure against such further activity.
   C.   This licensing section shall be enforced by a civil action or
proceeding, but the adjudication of a conviction under the criminal portions of
this chapter dealing with lewdness and obscenity or conviction under analogous
state statutes dealing with obscenity and pornography shall be conclusively
presumed to constitute a violation of this section, and shall lead to the
mandatory immediate suspension of the license, in accord with the above
provisions. (Prior code § 10-8-13; amd. Ord. 1308-80, 1980)
9.32.110: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO PROSECUTION:
   A.   It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this chapter that the
distribution of pornographic material was restricted to institutions or persons
having scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification for
possessing pornographic material.
   B.   It is not a defense to prosecution under this chapter that the actor
was a motion picture projectionist, usher, ticket taker, bookstore employee, or
otherwise was required to violate any provision of this chapter incident to his
employment. (Prior code § 10-8-7; amd. Ord. 1308-80, 1980)
9.32.120: ENFORCEMENT BY RESTRAINING ORDER, INJUNCTIONS AND OTHER PROCESSES;
SERVICE OF PROCESS:
   A.   The city court shall have full power, authority and jurisdiction, upon
application by the city attorney, to issue any and all proper restraining
orders, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and any other writs and
processes appropriate and lawful to carry out and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. No restraining order or injunction, however, shall issue except
upon notice to the person sought to be enjoined. That person shall be entitled
to a trial of the issues, commencing within three (3) days after filing of any
answer to the complaint, and a decision shall be rendered by the court within
two (2) days after the conclusion of the trial. If a final order or judgment of
an injunction is entered against the person sought to be enjoined, this final
order or judgment shall contain a provision directing the person to surrender
to the sheriff of the county in which the action was brought any pornographic
material in his possession which is subject to the injunction; and the police
chief shall be directed to seize and destroy this material.
   B.   Any person not qualified to do business in the city who sends or brings
pornographic material into the city with the intent to distribute or exhibit it
to others in the city thereby consents that he may be sued in any proceedings
commenced under this section, and therefor appoints the city recorder to be the
agent upon whom may be served all legal process against the person. Service of
process shall be made by serving a copy of the same upon the city recorder, or
by filing the copy in his office, together with payment of a fee of two dollars
($2.00), and this service shall be sufficient service upon the defendant if:
      1.   Notice of the service and a copy of the process are, within ten (10)
days thereafter, sent by mail by the prosecuting attorney to the defendant at
the address of the defendant that appears on any material exhibited or
distributed, and if no address appears, then the last known address of the
defendant; and
      2.   The prosecuting attorney's affidavit of compliance with the
provisions of this subsection is attached to the summons.
   C.   The city recorder shall keep a record of all the processes served upon
him under this section, showing in this the day and hour of the service.
Nothing in this subsection or subsection B of this section shall be construed
to limit the operation of rule 17(e) of the Utah rules of civil procedure.
   D.   This section shall not be construed in any way to limit the city court
in the exercise of its jurisdiction under any other provision of law. (Prior
code § 10-8-8; amd. Ord. 1308-80, 1980)
9.32.130: SEARCH AND SEIZURE PROCEDURES; HEARING WHEN MATERIAL SEIZED CLAIMED
TO BE NOT PORNOGRAPHIC:
   A.   An affidavit for a search warrant shall be filed with the magistrate,
describing with specificity the material sought to be seized. Where practical,
the material alleged to be pornographic shall be attached to the affidavit for
search warrant so as to afford the magistrate the opportunity to examine this
material.
   B.   Upon the filing of an affidavit for a search warrant, the magistrate
shall determine, by examination of the material sought to be seized, if
attached, by examination of the affidavit describing the material, or by such
other manner or means that he deems necessary, whether probable cause exists
for the immediate issuance of a search warrant. Upon making this determination,
he shall issue a search warrant ordering the seizure of the material described
in the affidavit for a search warrant according to the provisions of the Utah
rules of criminal procedure.
   C.   In the event that a search warrant is issued and material alleged to be
pornographic is seized under the provisions of this section, any person
claiming to be in possession of this material, or claiming ownership of it at
the time of its seizure, may file a notice in writing with the magistrate
within ten (10) days after the date of the seizure, alleging that the material
is not pornographic.
   D.   The magistrate shall set a hearing within seven (7) days after the
filing of this notice, or at such other time as the claimant might agree. At
this hearing, evidence may be presented as to whether there is probable cause
to believe the material seized is pornographic, and at the conclusion of the
hearing, the magistrate shall make a further determination of whether probable
cause exists to believe that the material is pornographic. A decision as to
whether there is probable cause to believe the seized material is pornographic
shall be rendered by the court within two (2) days after the conclusion of the
hearing.
   E.   If at the hearing the magistrate finds that no probable cause exists to
believe that the material is pornographic, then the material shall be returned
to the person or persons from whom it was seized. If the material seized is a
film, and the claimant demonstrates that no other copy of the film is available
to him, the court shall allow the film to be copied at the claimant's expense
pending the hearing.
   F.   If a motion to suppress the evidence is granted on the grounds of an
unlawful seizure, the property shall be restored unless it is subject to
confiscation as contraband, in which case it shall not be returned.
   G.   Procedures under this section for the seizure of allegedly pornographic
material shall be cumulative of all other lawful means of obtaining evidence as
provided by the laws of this state. Nothing contained in this section shall
prevent the obtaining of allegedly pornographic material by purchase, subpoena
duces tecum, or under injunction proceedings, as authorized by this act or by
other provisions of law of the state. (Prior code § 10-8-10; amd. Ord. 1308-80,
1980)
9.32.140: CORPORATE DEFENDANTS; SUMMONS PROCEDURE:
The attendance in court of a corporation, for purposes of prosecuting a
criminal action against it under this chapter, may be accomplished by the
issuance and service of a summons. A summons shall be issued by a magistrate if
he finds probable cause that the material in the possession of the corporation
against which the summons is sought is pornographic, which finding shall be
made upon affidavit describing with specificity the material alleged to be
pornographic or in such other manner or means the magistrate deems necessary.
Where practical, the material alleged to be pornographic shall be attached to
the affidavit so as to afford the magistrate the opportunity to examine this
material. The summons must be served upon the corporation by delivery of it to
an officer, director, managing or general agent, or cashier or the assistant
cashier thereof. The production of material alleged to be pornographic, in any
proceedings under this chapter against a corporation, may be compelled by the
issuance and service of a subpoena duces tecum. It is not the intent of this
section to prohibit or limit the use of subpoena duces tecum in proceedings
against natural persons under this chapter. (Prior code § 10-8-11; amd. Ord.
1308-80, 1980)

combination of alcohol and any drug, as detailed in sections

officer, draws a sample of blood from any person whom a peace officer has
reason to believe is driving in violation of this chapter, or hospital or

or criminal liability arising therefrom, provided such test is administered

The person to be tested may, at his own expense, have a physician of his own

administered at the direction of the peace officer. The failure or inability to
obtain such additional test shall not affect admissibility of the results of
the test or tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, nor preclude nor
delay the test or tests to be taken at the direction of a peace officer. Such
additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered at the
direction of a peace officer. (Ord. 1354-83, 1983)

12.16.040: Procedure
12.16.010: POLICY PERSPECTIVE:
Trees are desirable in the public rights of way when planted to promote
landscape beautification, shade, wind barriers and wildlife habitat.
Elimination of parkway trees considered undesirable, noxious, nuisances,
problematic or unmanageable is preferred and encouraged. (Res. 2011-04, 2011)
12.16.020: POLICY:
Trees may be planted within the public rights of way, so long as the forestry
policy guidelines set forth below are followed. (Res. 2011-04, 2011)
12.16.030: POLICY GUIDELINES:
   A.   Tree Inventory: The city may conduct an inventory of trees within the
public rights of way. Said inventory may include: the number of trees, type,
location, spacing, size (height, caliper, and canopy), condition (health,
disease, and damage), encroachments (surface, underground, overhead, pedestrian
or vehicular traffic) and ownership (private, city, other).
   B.   Tree Education: The city may implement a tree educational program which
may include, but shall not be limited to: instructional sheets, diagrams,
pamphlets, school presentations, Arbor Day celebrations, etc.
   C.   Tree Districts: Districts may be formed to facilitate specialized tree
plantings and formation of management areas that address a beautification theme
or similar effect. The trees may be under one ownership, regardless of property
boundaries or frontage. Areas where districts may be formed include, but are
not limited to, Main Street, city entryways, gardens, parks or cemeteries.
   D.   Tree Forestry: The city may organize and budget for a forestry crew
with personnel, equipment, training, supplies and materials. Contract labor and
equipment may also be used.
   E.   Shade Tree Commission: As deemed necessary by the city council a shade
tree commission may be organized.
   F.   Tree Ownership: Trees shall be owned and maintained by the individual
or group planting the trees unless designated otherwise. Existing trees within
the public rights of way shall be under the ownership and management of the
adjacent and abutting property owner(s).
   G.   Tree Varieties: Only those tree varieties authorized by the city shall
be planted within the public rights of way. Acceptable trees are those whose
roots, trunks, and branches will not encroach upon adjacent improvements such
as curbs, gutters, sidewalks, pipes, wires, streetlights, fire hydrants,
utilities, etc., and will not impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Only
fruitless tree varieties should be planted. A list of trees that may be planted
in the public rights of way and a list of trees that are prohibited are listed
below.
   PRICE CITY RECOMMENDED PARKWAY TREES
   Recommended to be planted in Price City public right of way (5 feet width or
greater) parkways:
      American hornbeam (or, musclewood)
      Amur chokecherry
      Amur maackia
      Bradford pear (fruitless variety)
      Callery pear (fruitless variety)
      Chitalpa
      Flowering cherry (fruitless variety) (or, Myrobalan)
      Flowering plum (fruitless variety)
      Fringetree (or, white fringetree)
      Japanese lilac
      Mulberry (fruitless variety)
      Purple leaf plum (fruitless variety)
   Note: Trees are not to be planted in parkways that are less than five feet
(5') in width, to avoid conflict with utilities (above or under ground) and/or
obstruct sight distance.
   TREES NOT RECOMMENDED
   It is recommended that the following trees not be planted anywhere within
Price City limits:
      Box elder
         Undesirable as an ornamental. Often becomes nearly completely
defoliated in early summer by the box elder leaf roller.
      Box elder bugs can be a nuisance where female trees are found (they feed
on the fruit).
         Weak wooded and have poor branch structure. Difficult to prune and
remove.
         Trees get very large and require large amount of moist deep soil and
area.
      Chinese elm
         Has many undesirable features and should not be planted in most cases.
         Weak wood. Difficult to prune and remove.
         Diseases and insects cause problems for this species.
      Cottonwood
         Weak wooded and have poor branch structure. Trees grow very large and
are dangerous to people and property. Difficult to prune and remove.
         Requires large amounts of water.
         The cotton like material that the tree produces becomes a large
nuisance to all surrounding properties.
      Globe willow
         Weak wood and/or branch structure. Susceptibility to slime flux and
other disease and insect problems. Overwhelming branch and canopy. Uproots
sidewalks. Difficult to prune and remove.
         Prefers abundant water. Rarely should be planted.
         Dropping limbs and branches are extremely obnoxious. The grass below
the tree often dies away.
      Russian olive
         This tree is very aggressive, weedy, drops many seeds, has thorns, and
has been declared a noxious weed in Carbon, Duchesne, and Uintah Counties in
Utah. It has caused some serious environmental degradation and should not be
planted.
      Tamarisk
         This shrubby tree is a pest and should not be planted because of its
weedy characteristics.
         Drops a lot of seeds that flourish and overtake the surrounding area.
   H.   Location Of Trees: Trees may be planted in the street parkway. The
parkway is the space between the street back of curb and front edge of
sidewalk. Trees should not be planted in parkways that are less than five feet
(5') wide.
   I.   Spacing: Trees shall be planted so that they do not create a hedge or
obscure adequate sight distance important to pedestrians and vehicular traffic.
On a street corner no trees shall be planted within a forty foot by forty foot
(40' x 40') triangle, from the intersecting property lines, in order to provide
adequate corner sight distance.
   J.   Planting: A hole of sufficient width and depth shall be excavated to
allow adequate room for tree roots. Following placement of the new tree, the
hole should be backfilled with the excavated and/or other suitable material
that will encourage adequate growth of the tree. Generally accepted tree
planting procedures should be followed and Blue Stakes should always be called
before digging.
   K.   Care: Once a tree is planted then it shall be maintained to promote the
health of the tree, to prevent unnecessary encroachment and to ensure public
safety. Care shall include watering, fertilizing, pruning, removal and applying
herbicide or pesticides, if needed.
   L.   Clearances: No part of a tree shall overhang the public right of way
such that it blocks pedestrian passage, vehicle travel, streetlights and
adequate sight distance. Trees shall not be planted closer to: a driveway or
alley than ten feet (10'), a fire hydrant than five feet (5') and a stop sign
than thirty feet (30'). Avoid planting in front of any sign. In all cases
measure from the center of the tree trunk. Be aware of what size the full grown
tree trunk diameter will be.
   M.   Growth: Tree growth shall be managed to enable a tree to reach its
intended size and shape. The height, trunk, limbs, roots, width and spread
should be monitored to prevent: obscuring sight distance, blocking pedestrian
and vehicle passage, covering streetlight illumination or damage to utilities
and improvements. Seasonal cleanup of leaves, limbs, seeds, fruit droppings and
other debris associated with trees within the public rights of way shall be the
responsibility of the adjacent and abutting property owners.
   N.   Pruning: Trees shall be pruned to remove: overgrowth, diseased, dead,
decayed or broken limbs, parts of the tree causing a problem with utilities,
tree limbs obstructing sight distance or inhibiting pedestrian and vehicle
movement or otherwise creating an unsafe condition. Tree limbs shall not
obstruct a clear space of eight feet (8') over sidewalks or thirteen feet (13')
over streets. Trees with multiple trunks shall be pruned to prevent bush like
growth. The spoils from tree pruning shall not be left in the public right of
way, but shall be removed and disposed of properly in a timely way. Weather
related tree damage shall be removed.
   O.   Removal: Should a tree create a problem that cannot be resolved by
pruning or other tree care methods, then it is to be removed. Removal shall
include bringing the entire tree down to the ground. The stump shall be removed
by excavating and/or grinding. If necessary, the tree shall be treated before
removal to prevent growth from the stump or spread of roots. When removing a
tree, the area around the tree impacted by falling branches, shall be secured
including placement of traffic control as needed. The spoils of the tree
removal shall be removed from the public rights of way and disposed of properly
in a timely way. Blue Stakes should always be called before digging.
   P.   Safety: Safety precautions should be implemented when climbing,
cutting, pruning or removing a tree. No one should ever attempt to work in or
around a tree that has grown into surface, underground or overhead utilities.
   Q.   Abuse; Mutilation Or Vandalism Of Trees: No person shall intentionally,
maliciously or neglectfully damage, cut, scalp, break, hit, treat, carve, burn,
nail into, bind with wire, etc., any tree.
   R.   Notification: Blue Stakes should always be contacted prior to digging
and the city should be alerted if tree limbs extend into overhead wires (power,
telephone, cable, etc.).
   S.   Emergency: The city shall have the right to prune or remove a tree that
poses an immediate danger to property, pedestrians, or vehicular traffic. The
city shall make a reasonable effort to notify the adjacent property owner and/
or tree owner prior to commencement of pruning or tree removal.
   T.   Private Property: On private property small or medium size trees shall
not be planted any closer to the sidewalk than five feet (5') and large trees
shall not be planted any closer to the sidewalk than ten feet (10'). Trees
should not be planted such that they interfere with overhead, surface or
underground utilities, nor pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Removal or the
avoidance of planting trees considered undesirable, noxious or a nuisance is
encouraged. (Res. 2011-04, 2011)

13.04.290: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter:
APPROVED BACKFLOW ASSEMBLY: Accepted by the Utah department of health, bureau
of drinking water/sanitation, as meeting an applicable specification or as
suitable for the proposed use.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises other
than the purveyor's public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary
water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's
public potable water supply or any natural source, such as a well, spring,
river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These
waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not
have authority for sanitary control.
BACK PRESSURE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under
pressure into the feeding distribution pipes of a potable water supply system
from any source, other than the intended source.
BACK SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into
the distribution pipes of potable water supply system from any source, other
than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable
water supply system.
BACKFLOW: The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphonage.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. Specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained
within the Utah plumbing code, chapter 10 (appendix J), and the cross
connection control program for Utah.
CONTAMINATION: A degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by
sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures
which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other material of
questionable quality to come in contact with potable water inside a
distribution system. This would include any temporary connections, such as
swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy
sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding multiport tubes, or
other plumbing arrangements.
CROSS CONNECTION CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow assembly
at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or
control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water
system; or, the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the
service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system
where there are actual or potential cross connections which cannot be
effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection
(isolation).
CROSS CONNECTION, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system and a
nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly
installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
WATER PURVEYOR: The person designated to be in charge of the water department
of Price City, is vested with the authority and responsibility for the
implementation of an effective cross connection control program, and for the
enforcement of the provisions of this article. (Ord. 90-009, 1990)
13.04.300: POLICY:
   A.   Protection Required:
      1.   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the public water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by the state laws, regulations, codes and this article. Service of
water to a consumer found to be in violation of this article shall be
discontinued by the water purveyor after due process of written notification
and an appropriate time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:
         a.   A backflow prevention assembly required by this article for
control of backflow and cross connection is not installed, tested and
maintained; or
         b.   If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been
removed or bypassed; or
         c.   If an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises; or
         d.   If the periodic system survey has not been conducted.
      2.   Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are
corrected.
   B.   Inspections: The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all
reasonable times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to
determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards,
including violation of this article, exist and to audit the results of the
required survey, as provided in subsection
13.04.250B of this article.
   C.   Assembly Required: Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service
connection's water usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply,
an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line
of the identified consumer's water system, at or near the property line, or
immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the
first branch line leading off the service line.
   D.   Type Of Assembly: The type of protective assembly required under
subsection C of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which
exists at the point of cross connection (whether direct or indirect),
applicable to local and state requirements or resulting from the required
survey.
   E.   Presently Installed Assemblies: All presently installed backflow
prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but
were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of
installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection F of this section, be
excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is
assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever
the existing assembly is moved from the present location or requires more than
minimum maintenance or, when the water purveyor finds that the operation or
maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be
replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and
state requirements.
   F.   Maintenance, Testing: It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at
any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have
certified surveys/inspections, and operational tests made at least once per
year at the consumer's expense. In those instances where the public water
purveyor deems the hazard to be great, he may require certified surveys/
inspections and tests at a more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the
public water purveyor to see that these tests are made according to the
standards set forth by the state department of health, bureau of drinking
water/sanitation.
   G.   Initial Testing: All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested
within ten (10) working days of initial installation.
   H.   Safety Hazard Prohibited: No backflow prevention assembly shall be
installed so as to create a safety hazard. Example: Installed over an
electrical panel, steam pipes, boilers, pits or above ceiling level. (Ord. 90-
009, 1990)
13.04.310: FAILURE TO CORRECT; PENALTY:
If violations of this article exist or if there has not been any corrective
action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days of the written notification
of deficiencies noted within the survey, then the public water purveyor shall
deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical
break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in
conformance with the state and city statutes relating to plumbing, safe
drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 90-
009, 1990)

The regulations set out in this chapter set forth the policy within the city
for the construction of electrical distribution systems in new subdivisions and
electrical connections of all other residential, commercial and industrial
services. (Ord. 1392-86, 1986)
13.20.020: SUBDIVISIONS; PLANS, ESTIMATED COST AND CONSTRUCTION:
Plans for new development will be provided to the city in accordance with the
land development code, whereupon the city will prepare an estimate of cost for
installation of the basic electrical distribution system. The developer must
pay for the subdivision system and deposit the estimated amount with the city
treasurer. After review of the proposed plan, the city shall construct the
system. Upon completion of the installation of the complete electrical system,
individual customer's services to the meter included, the ownership shall
remain within the city, to be operated and maintained by the city. Any
difference between actual costs and estimated costs of installation will be
adjusted when actual costs are determined. (Ord. 1392-86, 1986)
13.20.030: ADDITIONAL POWER LINE COSTS:
If the site of a new subdivision, or proposed construction, is not near a power
line of sufficient capacity to supply electrical services, the owner must
negotiate with the city on the payment of cost of construction for the
necessary addition to the distribution system. (Ord. 1392-86, 1986)
13.20.040: STREET LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS:
Every subdivision and commercial or industrial project undertaken pursuant to
this policy, and where deemed necessary by the governing body, shall include
the installation of street lighting. Streetlights shall be lights of nine
thousand five hundred (9,500) lumens or greater, and shall be placed
approximately every two hundred fifty feet (250'), and shall include lighting
of all intersections and any other hazardous traffic areas, to be determined by
the planning and zoning commission and approved by the governing body. (Ord.
1392-86, 1986)
13.20.050: SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES:
Customers desiring to make new or additional electrical service connections to
the city distribution system shall pay a connection charge as set by resolution
of the city council.
   A.   Residential: Residential, small commercial and industrial customers
requiring services not to exceed two hundred (200) amperes, single phase, at
120/240 volts, may make connections as follows:
      1.   Overhead; in those areas serviced by an overhead distribution
system;
      2.   Underground from an underground system; the customer will provide
and install the service loop. This type of service will be required in all new
residential subdivisions except where conditions will not permit, as determined
by the governing body;
      3.   Underground from an overhead system; the customer must dig and
backfill the trench and conform to national electrical code specifications.
   B.   Other Services: Costs for services other than those specified in
subsection A of this section will be paid as follows:
      1.   Residential: The customer will pay all costs for transformers,
meters, conductors, etc., above the normal cost of single phase service.
      2.   Commercial And Industrial: Plans for commercial and industrial
projects must be provided to the city in sufficient time to schedule
construction of the distribution system and must contain detailed information
as to requested load, type of service and estimates of usage. The estimated
revenues for a period of thirty six (36) months will be subtracted from the
estimated cost of construction. Any positive difference will be paid as a
nonrefundable cash advance by the customer to the city and will be used as aid
to construction in providing the service.
   C.   Repairs: In all cases where the trenching and backfilling is done by
the customer or his contractor, the customer will be responsible for the cost
of any repairs required on his service for the first year after installation.
The cost of these repairs will be paid by the customer.
   D.   Underground Wires; Conduit: Any underground service wires that are to
be covered by any structure such as carports, patios, roadways, driveways and
like structures must be encased in NES code approved conduit provided by the
customer or his contractor. (Ord. 1392-86, 1986)
13.20.055: SUBDIVISION/RESIDENTIAL REBATE:
   A.   Conditions: Construction of new residential single-family or multiple-
family dwelling units (individual lots or as part of a subdivision), as defined
in the city land development code, shall be eligible for a rebate under the
following conditions:
      1.   The total construction cost of the electrical service extensions,
including services, transformers, plus overhead, plus the cost of any additions
to or rearrangement of present facilities necessary to serve the customer, have
been paid either by the owner, contractor or developer, prior to any building
permits having been issued;
      2.   Service connection fees and/or any applicable impact fees as set by
the adopted rate schedules then in force have been paid in full;
      3.   A two (2) year period has elapsed since the issuance of an occupancy
permit for the subject new dwelling or, in the case of an approved platted and
recorded subdivision, fifty percent (50%) of the dwellings therein are
occupied.
   B.   Calculation Of Rebates: Rebates will be calculated on a predetermined
average consumption figure to be calculated yearly, multiplied by the then
prevailing residential electrical service rate, and then multiplied by the net
revenues to the city electrical fund:
 
Example: 2005
Single residential unit:
   Consumption average               kWh per month
   Prevailing rate                   (See note 1)
   Net revenue         %          
                        
 
Note:
   1.    The prevailing rate will equal the prevailing kWh rate as set forth in
the city rate table 101 then in existence on the date the rebate request is
received by the city.
   C.   Eligible Residential Subdivisions: Eligible residential subdivisions
rebates will be based on the total number of platted and approved lots.
   D.   Maximum: Rebates shall not exceed the total costs as outlined in
subsection A1 of this section. (Ord. 98-001, 1998; amd. Ord. 2001-009, 2001;

CHAPTER 15.36
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
15.36.010: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And Methods
15.36.020: Definitions
15.36.030: General Provisions
15.36.040: Administration
15.36.050: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
15.36.060: Penalties
15.36.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Utah has in
Utah Code Annotated 10-3-701 delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt regulations assigned to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore the city council of Price City,
Utah, does ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   Flood hazard areas are those specified by the federal emergency
management agency (FEMA) as they appear in the flood insurance study (FIS) and
flood insurance rate maps (FIRM). Said areas are primarily the 100-year flood
boundaries along the Price River, Meads Wash, and selected tributaries within
the city.
      2.   The flood hazard areas of Price City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      3.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses:
      1.   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
         a.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
         b.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         c.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
         d.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage;
         e.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.020: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so
as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before July 12, 1983, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      1.   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
      2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (public law 97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)

   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Price City.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study For
Carbon County", dated May 2, 2012, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps
and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Price
City automatically adopts all FEMA effective flood insurance rate maps and all
FEMA effective flood insurance studies.
   C.   Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.040: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of The Floodplain Administrator: The city engineer is
hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the
provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (national
flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.

permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
      5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
      6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is the Utah department of public safety, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the federal emergency management agency.
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with subsection
15.36.030B of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of section
15.36.050 of this chapter.
      9.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
      10.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'), provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision).
   C.   Permit Procedures:
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
         b.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any

15.36.050B2 of this chapter;
         d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
         e.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection B1 of this section.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
   D.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      2.   The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      3.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      4.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request.
      5.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      6.   Variances may be issued for substantial improvements on a lot of
one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the
relevant factors in subsection C2 of this section have been fully considered.
      7.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (subsection
15.36.010C of this chapter).
      8.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      9.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      10.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
         a.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         b.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         c.   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      11.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
         a.   The criteria outlined in subsections D1 through D9 of this
section are met, and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.050: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
      2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      7.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsections
15.36.030B and
15.36.040B8 of this chapter, or subsection C3 of this section, the following
provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this
subsection as proposed in subsection
15.36.040C1 of this chapter, is satisfied.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of
one foot (1') above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
floodplain administrator.
      3.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      4.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on
a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         b.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 1)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         c.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of this subsection B4 be elevated so that either:
            (1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation, or
            (2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no
less than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days,
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
         c.   Meet the permit requirements of subsection
15.36.040C1 of this chapter, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in subsection B4 of this section. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and
has no permanently attached additions.
   C.   Standards For Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with subsections
15.36.010B, C and D of this chapter.
      2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions within zones A1-
30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of
subsections
15.36.030C and 15.36.040C of this chapter and the provisions of this section.
      3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is
lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsection
15.36.030B or
15.36.040B8 of this chapter.
      4.   All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
      5.   All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage.
   D.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones): Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection
15.36.030B of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These
areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
         a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified), or
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
      3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection
15.36.040C1 of this chapter, are satisfied.
      4.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   E.   Floodways: Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard
established in subsection
15.36.030B of this chapter, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
      1.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection E1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
      3.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.060: PENALTIES:
   A.   Penalties For Noncompliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of
the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a class C misdemeanor. Any person
who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall
upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned, or both consistent with Price
City's set penalties for class C misdemeanor violations, for each violation,
and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent Price City from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)

ARTICLE I. INTRODUCTION
17.10.010: PLAN INTRODUCTION:
The Price City general plan, referred to herein as the "plan", is the official
statement of both short and long range goals and strategies to guide growth and
development within the city. The plan focuses on improving the physical
environment of the city as well as the quality of life of the citizens. It is
intended to be an effective working tool employed by the city in making
community decisions and achieving planning goals.
An important companion and reference document to this plan is found in appendix
A, "Price City: A 21st Century Community", on file in the city.
   A.   Plan Update: The process to update the Price City general plan began in
September 2003. The city general plan prior to that time had not been
officially adopted or updated for several years. The task set forth was to, in
essence, start from scratch and create a new plan, which could serve as a
foundational plan for the community into future years.
   A general plan advisory committee was created to work with the planning
consultants, the planning group at J-U-B Engineers. The committee was made up
of various members of the community, as well as representatives from city
staff, the planning commission and the city council. In the scope of four (4)
meetings, the committee was charged with the responsibility to provide feedback
and direction for the establishment of the elements and goals for the new
general plan. Meeting with a group of community stakeholders, the committee
participated in several visioning and planning exercises. Six (6) neighborhood
meetings were held in various locations throughout the city to allow the public
an opportunity to provide input into the planning process. Additional public
input was sought and received through the distribution of a survey.
   The survey requested input in the following areas: 1) vision for the future;
2) quality of life; 3) growth in the community; 4) economic development; 5)
downtown revitalization; 6) roadways/transportation; 7) parks and recreation;
and 8) comments. Approximately three thousand eight hundred (3,800) surveys
were mailed to Price residents with the city utility billings in September,
with additional copies distributed at city hall.
   A total of three hundred twenty five (325) surveys were returned,
representing a return rate of eight and one-half percent (81/2%). The average
national rate of return for such surveys is approximately three percent (3%).
In general, survey respondents displayed a feeling that Price is a good place
to live and raise a family. Key issues involving a lot of interest and support
by the respondents include the need for:
      1.   More job opportunities and expanded economic development;
      2.   More recreation opportunities and youth activities;
      3.   A better, cleaner atmosphere and appearance in the city; and
      4.   Continued emphasis on a city which is a good, friendly, and safe
place for children and families.
(For more survey results, see appendix B, "Price City General Plan Survey
Results", as referenced in the ordinance codified herein, on file in the city.)
Following review and revisions, public hearings before the planning commission
and city council were held. The plan, as presented here, was adopted by the
Price City council on April 13, 2004. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.020: MOTTO, MISSION AND VISION:
Listed below are the motto, mission statement and vision statement of the Price
City general plan as developed and recommended by the general plan advisory
committee, and as part of the "Price City: A Utah 21st Century Community"
report.
The motto serves as a slogan to paint a picture or send a message in relation
to the character of the community. The mission statement represents the
overriding purpose of what the city is and does. The vision statement reflects
the shared image of what people want the city to become at some point in the
future. It is the big picture to guide decisions.
   MOTTO
      Price, the Heart of Utah's Castle Country 1
   MISSION STATEMENT
      The mission of Price City is to protect and promote the welfare of all
citizens by ensuring exceptional service and leadership through communication,
cooperation and creativity.
   VISION STATEMENT
      Price will be a clean, friendly community that retains its safe, small
town feel and charm. The citizens envision a city that is progressive, unified,
rich in heritage and ethnic diversity, with economic security and responsive
government, quality education, healthy environment and good medical facilities.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
 
Notes
1 1. See also the motto to be used for economic development purposes in section
  17.10.190 of this chapter.
17.10.030: IMPLEMENTATION:
Implementation of the plan comes through working documents, such as the zoning
and subdivision ordinances, capital improvement programs, city budgets, and
other ordinances, resolutions and studies thought appropriate by the city
council. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.040: AMENDMENTS:
To preserve the integrity of the plan and to ensure that it reflects the
changing needs of residents, it is city policy that:
   A.   The plan shall receive a comprehensive review at least once every five
(5) years to keep the policies and programs consistent with changing trends and
conditions;
   B.   All rezones, improvement programs, and ordinance changes concerning
development shall be in harmony with the plan.
The public may request amendments to the plan up to three (3) times during any
one calendar year. The months in which the city council will hold a public
hearing to consider the public's requests are: February, June and October. The
applicant must show that any amendment of the plan is in the best interest of
the city, promotes the general welfare of the community, and does not decrease
the quality of life for the citizens of Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.050: HISTORY OF PRICE:
Price, the county seat of Carbon County, is the largest city in the county and
is located in the Price River Valley of the Colorado Plateau region of Utah. It
is believed that Price was named after LDS Bishop William Price of Goshen,
Utah, who explored the region in 1869. The area was originally a part of
Sanpete County, and then was included in Emery County when it was created in
1880. Price was organized on July 14, 1892, while it was still a part of Emery
County.
Caleb Baldwin Rhoades and Abraham Powell, trappers from Salem, Utah, were the
first recorded settlers in the Price River Valley. They arrived in October 1877
and built a cabin in the northwest corner of what is now Price. The two (2)
returned to Salem when the trapping season was over. Their talk aroused
interest in the area among their friends and families, and they soon convinced
a group to join them in relocating in the Price River Valley. However, Abraham
Powell never returned to Price as he was killed by a bear on December 7, 1878,
while hunting in the Nebo Mountains.
On January 21, 1879, Caleb Rhoades returned to the valley with two (2)
brothers, Frederick Empire Grames and Charles W. Grames. The men helped each
other build homes for their families. Later that year, they were joined by
their families and others, most coming from Utah County.
These early pioneers of Price experienced much hardship. Food was in short
supply, and crops were difficult to grow because of a lack of irrigation water.
Water had to be carried from the river in barrels and tanks. An irrigation
ditch to carry water to the fields was of utmost importance. Construction of
two (2) ditches began in February 1879 when Caleb Rhoades and Frederick Grames
began the project. A community effort eventually finished the two (2) ditches,
but it wasn't until the Price Water Company Canal was finished in 1888 that the
irrigation problem was solved. The canal is still in use today.
The character of Price changed dramatically with the completion of the railroad
in 1883. Price was quickly transformed from an isolated farming community to
the commercial hub of Castle Valley. The railroad was directly responsible for
Price becoming the retail, political, educational, and cultural center of the
area. The railroad also opened up the nearby coal mines, which brought
thousands of foreign born, non-Mormon immigrants to work the mines. Originally
these miners lived in the coal camps near the mines, but Price gradually
assimilated many of them, reflecting the ethnic diversity of the county and
becoming a cultural hub as well. These immigrants came from many countries, but
the majority was Greek, Italian, Austrian and Japanese. This diversified
population has remained today, making Price one of Utah's most culturally
complex and varied communities.
Price has a variety of stores and businesses, as well as many parks,
recreational facilities, schools, and a full service hospital. Price is also
the home of the College of Eastern Utah, a rapidly growing community college.
Past expansion and future plans for CEU Prehistoric Museum have made it one of
the best of its kind in the world.
The economy of Price is very much tied to the coal industry, and therefore has
been through many up and down cycles; but Price remains today the commercial
and cultural center of Castle Valley. Price has always been and continues to be
unique among Utah towns. (Source: Jane Lyman Johnson, Utah History
Encyclopedia) (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.060: DEMOGRAPHICS:
The most recent data available in most demographic categories is found in the
results of the census 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau (see "Exhibit 2, Price
Demographics", of this section). Figures from that census are still a good
representation of the Price community, since the community and economic growth
in recent years has been small. Population actually decreased between the 1990
and 2000 census reports by 3.6 percent, from 8,712 to 8,402. Community growth
through the year 2030 has been projected at 0.7 percent per year by the Utah
state governor's office of planning and budget. At this rate, the projected
population of Price in the year 2030 will be 11,481.

ARTICLE II. LAND USE
17.10.070: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the land use element is to demonstrate planning for community
quality of life and economic vitality by: 1) showing general land use
classifications; and 2) establishing land use goals that manage growth. (Ord.
2004-001, 2004)
17.10.080: LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS:
Price City land uses are divided into the categories of residential,
commercial, industrial and special districts (see "General Plan Land Use Map,
Exhibit 3", of this section). Each category is divided into land use
classifications, as follows:
   A.   Residential:
      1.   Rural Density (Zones Included: RR): The rural density residential
(RDR) classification is for residential uses in areas where a rural atmosphere,
open space preservation and agriculture uses are encouraged. The housing
density should not exceed one unit per gross acre. Exceptions to this maximum
density may be permitted as conditional use, subject to the clustering of
housing and provision of meaningful open space.
      2.   Low Density (Zones Included: SF-12, SF-8): The low density
residential (LDR) classification is for typical low density suburban
neighborhoods with single-family homes on individual building lots. The housing
density should not exceed four (4) units per gross acre.
      3.   Medium Density (Zones Included: SF-6, MR-7): The medium density
residential (MDR) classification is for smaller individual home lots and
multiple-family housing units such as duplexes, townhomes and other types of
small scale attached housing units. The housing density should not exceed seven
(7) units per gross acre.
      4.   High Density (Zones Included: MR-11): The high density residential
(HDR) classification is for multi-family development, such as apartment and
condominium complexes, with an overall housing density in excess of seven (7)
units per gross acre.
   B.   Commercial:
      1.   Community Commercial (Zones Included: N-C, S-C, GC): The community
commercial (CC) classification is for general shopping facilities to satisfy
the shopping needs of the community for a particular neighborhood. The
intensity of the commercial zone applied will depend on such factors as the
nature and location of surrounding uses, the ability to buffer surrounding
uses, and the availability of necessary infrastructure.
      2.   Highway Commercial (Zones Included: H-C): The highway commercial
(HC) classification is for commercial and service uses serving the needs of
thoroughfare traffic and the traveling public in locations adjacent to highways
or major streets.
   C.   Industrial:
      1.   Light Industrial (Zones Included: M-D): The light industrial (LI)
classification is intended to provide for clean and less intensive industrial,
manufacturing and technological uses. Facilities and operations to take place
within this designation should be designed to protect the environmental quality
of adjacent areas.
      2.   Heavy Industrial (Zones Included: M-G): The heavy industrial (HI)
classification is for a range of industrial and manufacturing uses, including
heavy industry. The intensity of the manufacturing uses and corresponding
zoning will depend on surrounding uses, existing infrastructure and the ability
to buffer and protect adjacent or nearby residential uses.
   D.   Special Districts:
      1.   Public Facilities (Zones Included: PF): A special district is
established to promote the effective planning and development of public
facilities and mixed land uses.
      2.   Special Planned Districts (Zones Included: CD, PL): Provision is
made for the establishment of special planned districts, allowing for mixed and
special development uses which may vary from zoning regulations, but which will
be a desirable asset to the community.
      3.   Overlay Districts (Zones Included: SA, DRA): Overlay districts do
not fall within a general plan classification since they are intended to mix
additional uses, limitations or designations with those allowed in the
underlying zoning, in various areas throughout the city. Overlay zones are
intended to be applied only when the overlay meets articulated needs of the
city.

17.10.090: ENVIRONMENT:
Protection of the environment is considered an important part of planning in
Price. Development plans should be sensitive to the environment of the
immediate area, as well as the whole community. Those areas in Price which are
considered to be environmentally sensitive include land which: a) is within a
designated 100-year floodplain; b) is subject to geological hazards, unstable
soil conditions, slopes in excess of twenty five percent (25%), or rockfall
areas; and c) has a high water table and ground water, including wetlands,
perched water and drainageways.
Areas within Price recognized as having significant concern for environmental
protection include the banks and adjacent lands along the Price River, Meads
Wash and associated drainage corridors. Additionally, there exists concern for
the protection and prevention of erosion of Wood Hill and other hills to the
north of the city. These areas require special attention by the city and any
potential developers, to make the protection of the environment an important
objective. (See "Environmentally Sensitive Areas Map, Exhibit 4", of this
section.)
   A.   Hillsides: Development on hillside areas is to be restricted with
regard to grading, slope, rockfall, natural vegetation, drainage, and the
provision of city services.
   B.   Wetlands: Wetlands are widely regarded as a valuable natural resource.
The values that wetlands provide include water filtration/purification, the
absorption and breakdown of toxins, the recharging of ground water, flood
control, habitat for wildlife, recreation and education and aesthetics. It is
the objective of Price City to preserve wetland areas where possible. In some
cases, however, the best course of action might be to consider development
which will improve and enhance disturbed wetlands.
Protection of the environment throughout the city also requires continued
attention to preserving and improving air quality, water quality and the
planting of trees.
   C.   Open Space Preservation: Open space preservation is recognized as an
important land use and function of Price City. Several areas within the city
are targeted for open space preservation, including the banks and adjoining
land along Price River, Meads Wash, and Price Canal, as well as Wood Hill.
These areas may include open space parks and the development of recreational
trails. Additionally, several areas which fall within designated potential
annexation areas include lands which are best suited to be maintained for open
space and recreational purposes.
Private property owners of undeveloped land, who do not desire to develop their
properties, are encouraged to preserve open space through conservation
easements, agriculture protection areas, or other open space preservation
methods.

17.10.100: ANNEXATION PLANS:
Annexation is a process by which the boundaries are extended to incorporate
additional lands into the city. Residents of a newly annexed area become
citizens of the city and share in the benefits and responsibilities of that
citizenship.
Unincorporated areas within one-half (1/2) mile of Price City's current
boundaries have been identified for possible future annexation and their
potential land use designations are shown on the Price City "General Plan Land
Use Map, Exhibit 3", of this chapter. The application of the recommended land
uses for those properties which seek annexation will allow for well planned and
cohesive growth. The identification of potential annexation lands and
annexation policies are outlined in the Price Municipal Corporation annexation
policy plan, referenced and incorporated into this plan as appendix C on file
in the city. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.110: IMPLEMENTATION:
The zoning and subdivision ordinances, as found in the Price City land
development code, shall carry out the land use element. Other sections of the
city code, however, may also carry out parts of this element.

ARTICLE III. URBAN DESIGN
17.10.120: INTRODUCTION:
Good urban design can improve the visual and functional relationship between
people and their physical environment. It can create a desirable physical form
for community needs and services. Because urban design overlaps other aspects
of planning such as recreation, open space, transportation, and commercial and
residential land uses, this article will focus on objectives towards the visual
design and image of the community. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.130: MAIN STREET AND BUSINESS CORRIDORS:
The character and success of a community is often defined by the urban design
and economic vitality of the downtown area and the business corridors. In
Price, the downtown area is generally seen as those blocks immediately
adjoining Main Street between Heritage park (400 West) and 300 East Street.
Within this area are many opportunities for urban design and community
improvement, including the refurbishing/restoration of building facades, and
the installation of streetscape elements. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.140: STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS:
Effectively designed and constructed streetscapes on Price's streets will do
much to improve their look, feel and effectiveness, and thereby have many
positive impacts on the economy and quality of life in Price.
What is a streetscape? It can be defined as a facelift; a beautification or
softening of a city street. It is a development project which invites
pedestrian traffic by adding human elements to the harsh environment of a
street designed mostly for the fast flow of vehicles. It provides physical and
designable characteristics that provide the setting for successful urban
living. Streetscape designs are intended to make the community's main street a
great street. A street people want to use. A street which helps define the
community.
Several options exist for designing streetscapes on Price's main corridors,
which include various combinations of streetscape elements. Streetscape
elements can be divided into two (2) categories:
   A.   Landscaping and surfaces, including trees, plants, grass, ground cover,
rocks, sidewalks and special surfaces;
   B.   Street furniture and features, including benches, planter boxes,
decorative garbage containers, drinking fountains, outdoor clocks, bollards,
themed signage, monuments, statues, public art, design lighting standards,
banners and special architectural features.
The Price City motto "Price, the Heart of Utah's Castle Country" and a city
logo should be visibly applied to those streetscape elements installed.
Successful streetscape projects would maintain the necessary access and traffic
flow for commercial needs, while also providing physical characteristics that
provide the setting for successful urban family living. Benefits to
streetscapes on the busy streets in Price include:
   A.   Vehicular traffic is calmed as the street feels more like a corridor to
move people and not just vehicles;
   B.   Investment appeal and quality development expand in a spruced up
commercial corridor;
   C.   Business activity increases in areas previously deemed harsh and
unsightly;
   D.   Increased pedestrian traffic is encouraged in a comfortable environment
with shade trees, benches and water fountains;
   E.   An increase in property values and community pride;
   F.   A sense of community core and cohesion is enhanced.
      1.   Main Street: Main Street is the most important corridor to the
community in terms of economics, historic heritage and community core. The
downtown section of Main Street, from approximately Heritage park at 400 West
to 300 East Street, carries special significance to the community as its core.
Special attention to maintaining and upgrading the appearance and feel of this
area is essential to its vitality and effectiveness. This section of Main
Street, along with those cross streets heading north and south for the distance
of one block, should be assigned the highest priority for streetscape
improvement projects in Price.
The remaining section of Main Street, between 300 East and the U.S. Highway 6
interchange, is also very important to the community, especially as a business
corridor. Although the development and design of the built environment varies
from that of the downtown area, attention to the quality of appearance of the
streets, sidewalks and landscaping can be equally beneficial to the community.
Streetscaping can take a different form in this area, but certain elements
should tie into the theme of what is used in the downtown section.
      2.   Other Main Corridors: Carbon Avenue and 100 North Street should be
considered second priority for streetscape improvements. As a third priority,
the following streets should be considered for streetscape improvements: 100
South Street, 300 East Street, 800 North Street, and Cedar Hills Drive.
Finally, improvements should be planned on the streets surrounding Washington
park and the College of Eastern Utah.
The most important areas for improvements on all streets are near major
intersections and freeway entrances.
      3.   Entryways: Entryway beautification is key to creating a great
impression for visitors and setting the tone for the beautiful and progressive
community that Price is and strives even more to become. Beautification
improvement projects at the entryways to the community can include many types
of streetscape features, but usually provide the most effective impact with
landscaping around highway interchanges and welcoming monuments. Entryway areas
in Price for which improvements should be considered include the entrances to
U.S. Highway 6 at Westwood Boulevard/100 North Street, Carbon Avenue, and East
Main Street/State Highway 55.
      4.   Urban Forestry: Trees play a significant role in the beautification
and urban design of the community. The Price City shade tree commission is
charged with promoting good urban forestry in the public rights of way. (Ord.
2004-001, 2004)
17.10.150: HISTORIC PRESERVATION:
Historic buildings and houses add much to the character of a city. There are
many sites in Price that either currently have, or have the potential to be
given, an official historic designation. National and state historic registers
consider a structure to be eligible for listing if that structure is at least
fifty (50) years old, has a high degree of physical integrity, meets certain
criteria concerning association with historic events, persons, architectural or
archeological significance or construction techniques.
The city's historical commission is involved in the preservation and
restoration of structures in the downtown area, with the goal to restore older
buildings to their original appearance. Also, there are many homes in the
community which warrant preservation and possible designation of historic
significance. A long range goal for the city and the historical commission is
to inventory, preserve and protect these significant structures. (Ord. 2004-
001, 2004)
17.10.160: OUTDOOR PUBLIC ART:
Outdoor public art, such as statues, art structures and other design features,
can benefit a community in many ways. Well placed and well designed public art
can:
   A.   Create cohesion in the urban design of a community;
   B.   Provide a sense of community for individual neighborhoods, as well as
the community at large;
   C.   Have a positive impact on the image of the community; and
   D.   Assist with community historical preservation efforts.
Public art in Price should be placed, where possible and practical, near
commercial centers, along major corridors, in parks, near recreational
facilities and at other locations where it can be seen by many people. Local
artists are encouraged to participate in the display of public art.

ARTICLE IV. ECONOMICS
17.10.170: INTRODUCTION:
Price City is interested in pursuing and maintaining a healthy level of
economic growth. Such growth is a means of providing a balanced, healthy
economy in Price. It is a means of expanding our tax base for better homes,
better schools and better public services. It is a means of providing more
employment opportunities.
The city also recognizes the importance of establishing and maintaining an
appropriate level of community sustainability. While total sustainability is
not possible, any reduction in the percentage of imported goods and services
strengthens the community's ability to survive both economically and
environmentally. The export of native goods and services to nearby communities,
if it does not denigrate the quality of life and impact the natural
environment, will also provide long term benefits to Price City. Those benefits
will be in terms of business opportunities, stable employment and increased
economic well being.
Price acts as a regional center for commercial needs and services in Carbon
County and surrounding areas. Building upon existing opportunities and services
becomes important as Price continues to fill this important role in the region.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.180: DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION:
The revitalization of the core of the community is one of the paramount
economic activities of the city. Downtown Price is currently a functioning and
valuable economic area of the city, although it is generally recognized as
needing greater support and improvement. The downtown area brings together the
convergence of the three (3) most important business corridors in Price, which
are Main Street, 100 North Street and Carbon Avenue. Each of these corridors
make connection to U.S. Highway 6, providing the backbone for business
opportunities and the economic success of the community.
Recognizing the importance for a vital and effective downtown, revitalization
efforts through redevelopment and other programs are being shaped by the city
and the business community. Several concepts have been recently introduced
which will serve to make downtown Price more viable. They include:
   A.   Streetscape improvements (see section
17.10.140 of this chapter);
   B.   Historic preservation (see section
17.10.150 of this chapter);
   C.   Redevelopment agency funding and business assistance;
   D.   Special events held in the downtown area;
   E.   The attraction of additional retail and commercial services;
   F.   Potential expansion of the CEU Prehistoric Museum.
The downtown area is currently included in a redevelopment area of the Price
City redevelopment agency (RDA).
Funding for improvements and business assistance in downtown has been
administered through the city for several years. It is recommended that an
extension or renewal of the RDA occurs, to maximize the ability for assisting
revitalization efforts well into the future.
Holding special events, such as farmers' markets, art festivals and other
street fairs, can be an effective method to draw more attention and business to
the downtown area. Combining the efforts of the city with that of downtown
business owners, the Carbon County chamber of commerce as well as local
resident volunteers can create successful special event ventures.
With the help of economic and planning consultants, and the use of a community
survey focused on the downtown area, the city has recently identified several
unmet commercial and retail demands and community needs that can and should be
met downtown (see appendix D, "Price City Community Survey And Executive
Summary", Wikstrom Economic and Planning Consultants, as referenced in the
ordinance codified herein, on file in the city). These include:
   A.   Additional retail anchors;
   B.   Restaurants, for lunchtime as well as nighttime dining;
   C.   Apparel stores, including specialty clothing and shoes;
   D.   Specialty shops such as sporting goods, nurseries/garden supplies,
sewing, hobbies, crafts, stationery and books;
   E.   Entertainment, such as bowling, theaters, live music. (Ord. 2004-001,
2004)
17.10.190: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:
Historically, the economy of Price and surrounding areas has had a strong
relationship with the development and production of energy resources, such as
coal mining. As energy uses and needs change, and new resources are utilized,
reliance on the economy of energy production can create difficulties for the
community. Diversity into the various fields of business and manufacturing are
the growing trend for successful economic pursuits in Price.
It is the city's intent to achieve the most desirable results in economic
development pursuits. To this end, an economic development plan should be
prepared and followed by the city in order to achieve the results desired by
the community. The preparation of the plan should be the oversight of a city
economic development advisory committee, which would work in concert with the
goals and efforts of the Carbon County economic development program.
Initially, the city economic development committee and plan should focus on:
   A.   Encouraging the attraction and development of business and industry
that offer Price new jobs and diversified economic vitality;
   B.   Continuing and improving upon assistance programs and funding for the
retention and development existing businesses;
   C.   Promoting tourism to Price and regional attractions; and
   D.   Improving the image of the community as a great place to live, work and
play.
A second city motto, selected by the general plan advisory committee and
intended for use in economic development pursuits, is:
   Price City, A Place of Value
City economic development marketing materials and promotional programs should
focus on the use of this motto in showcasing the city and its opportunities.
An effective tool for assisting new business ventures and the expansion of
existing businesses is found in the Price City economic vitality fund,
administered by the city. Granting loans of up to ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00), the city's program emphasizes the need for loan recipients to
improve local property values, generate employment and increase local economic
activity. This program should be continued and strengthened when possible.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.200: TOURISM:
Continued development of tourism to Price and regional attractions is another
opportunity to positively impact the local economy. Working in association with
the Carbon County travel bureau and regional agencies, the city can actively
assist the promotion of tourism. To do this effectively, marketing strategies
need to be defined, and the necessary resources need to be dedicated. Efforts
should be increased towards promoting Price, with its plethora of nearby
attractions and recreation opportunities, as a destination for travelers and
outdoor sports enthusiasts.
Unique characteristics of the community and the surrounding areas need to be
identified and emphasized. Continued and increased emphasis should occur in
promoting and building upon existing special amenities and themes, such as the
prehistoric museum and native peoples. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.210: COMMUNITY IMAGE:
Related to the promotion of tourism and economic development are efforts to
improve the image of the community. Promotion should focus on the community as
a great place to live, work and play, which offers opportunities and services
in all areas of life. Strong quality of life factors existing in Price should
be emphasized, such as the availability of recreation and outdoor adventures,
strong educational resources, the fairgrounds and special events, the CEU
Prehistoric Museum, good medical facilities, a low cost of living and a safe
atmosphere.
Beautification efforts in downtown, along main corridors and at community
entryways, as described in article III of this chapter, will have significant
impact on improving the community image. Improved community image can have
positive long term economic benefits on the city. New residents, including both
work force and retirement aged people will be attracted to looking at making
Price their home. More travelers will look to Price as a nice, fun destination
rather than a place they bypass. More businesses will look to Price as an
attractive community to do business in.

ARTICLE V. TRANSPORTATION
17.10.220: INTRODUCTION:
The effectiveness and functionality of the transportation system and how it
services population growth, has significant impact on the community. The city
plans to develop and maintain a system that is efficient and complements the
quality of life in Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.230: TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN:
It is the intent of the city to prepare and adopt a Price City transportation
master plan. Planning and providing for safe and efficient transportation is
the chief objective of such a plan. When completed, the master plan will be a
vital appendix to this article.
A transportation master plan includes planning for the flow of traffic on and
the use of city streets. In the streets component of a transportation plan,
policies are established which foster a safe and effective street system,
classify streets according to their intended function, establish street design
requirements, and identify areas where street improvements are needed. The
"Streets Classification Map, Exhibit 5", of this article, shows the existing
and intended use of Price City streets by classification.
Goals for improving and developing necessary transportation infrastructure are
outlined in a master plan. The following transportation issues relating to
streets and vehicular traffic are included in the goals of the Price City plan:
   A.   Street improvement projects, including the connection of Cedar Hills
Drive: 1) to Homestead Boulevard; and 2) the construction of Anadarko Road to
Airport Road, and Wood Hill Road; and
   B.   Highway improvement, including increased efforts to make U.S. Highway 6
into an interstate freeway.
Additionally, open space areas around the city should be reviewed to determine
needs for possible access and improved traffic flow. Connections may be
warranted from the southern end of 700 East Street to Highway 55, and between
the Castle Heights and Sagewood areas to Airport Road. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.240: PUBLIC TRANSIT:
Planning for mass transit systems, such as bus, rail and air traffic systems,
is another important component to be included in the Price City transportation
master plan. This area of transportation has much potential for further
development in Price.
As a community grows and improves, greater emphasis and desire is placed on the
development of public transit systems. Concepts needing further development in
relation to public transit systems in Price include:
   A.   Developing a public transit system between Helper, Price and
Wellington;
   B.   Placing more emphasis on the development and use of the airport;
   C.   Developing a bus station in Price; and
   D.   Developing a train station in Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.250: ALTERNATIVE MODES:
Alternative modes of transportation are strongly encouraged in Price. A system
of bicycle and pedestrian pathways is planned throughout the city to allow for
easy access and connection to most areas of the city. For more information, see
article VII, "Parks And Recreation", and "Parks, Recreation, And Trails,
Exhibit 6", of this chapter.

ARTICLE VI. HOUSING
17.10.260: INTRODUCTION:
This article focuses on the need for diverse housing opportunities in Price.
Although the population has remained relatively stable over recent years, needs
for various types of housing have increased. Having a median housing value of
ninety two thousand dollars ($92,000.00), per the 2000 census, the housing
market in Price is currently comprised largely of single- family, detached
homes. The median monthly mortgage is seven hundred fifty six dollars
($756.00), and the median rent is four hundred nine dollars ($409.00). Nearly
sixty percent (60%) of the homes in Price were built prior to 1970.
Addressing the needs for housing, the city has identified several issues,
including the need for an improved mix of housing options, more moderate income
housing options, infill housing development, and more quality high density
housing projects. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.270: HOUSING DENSITY AND OPTIONS:
Eighty percent (80%) of the housing in Price currently falls within a single-
family designation. The remaining twenty percent (20%), representing various
types of attached or multi-family housing units, provide most of the affordable
housing options in the community. It is the city's desire to preserve existing
areas of low density housing, while at the same time allowing for increased
medium to high density housing needs, such as student, senior and other quality
attached housing developments.
While the importance of providing affordable housing has increased in recent
years, the concept of providing a healthy balance of quality mid level and
higher end housing is being recognized as an increasingly important goal. A
diversification within Price City neighborhoods, including a mixture of low,
moderate and even high income housing units, is desired. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.280: MODERATE INCOME HOUSING:
Moderate income housing has become an increasingly imperative issue for Price
City in recent years. Economic conditions have caused housing costs in Price to
increase at rates higher than personal income and wages. Because of this
imbalance, many residents have been excluded from adequate housing
opportunities. The 2000 census points out that nearly ninety eight percent
(98%) (based on mean values) of the families living in Price are within the low
to moderate income levels.
The state of Utah defines moderate income housing as "housing occupied or
reserved for occupancy by households with a gross household income equal to or
less than eighty percent (80%) of the median gross income of the metropolitan
statistical area (MSA) for households of the same size". In other words,
moderate income housing is a function of the particular circumstances and
income levels of the community, rather than a type of housing.
In an effort to meet the needs for moderate income housing in the Price
community, a plan was created in October 2002 describing several policies and
establishing goals. The Price Municipal Corporation community affordable
housing plan is designed to assist decision making with housing issues. (See
appendix D, as referenced in the ordinance codified herein, on file in the
city.) (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.290: QUALITY HIGH DENSITY HOUSING:
In trying to meet the need for a balanced mix of housing in Price, a key
objective is to seek and require development of high quality. High density
residential developments, such as condominiums, townhomes, etc., which are not
geared toward meeting low or moderate income housing objectives, are currently
too few in number. The development of projects which include quality design,
landscaping, amenities and good maintenance should be encouraged and sought as
new housing demands increase.
   A.   Student Housing: An important and continuing need for high density
housing is in the realm of student housing. As the student enrollment
increases, further needs for providing student housing locations will arise.
Areas close in proximity to the College of Eastern Utah are deemed best for
additional student housing development. Nearby accommodations reduce car trips,
make student life more affordable, and help current single-family housing areas
maintain their integrity.
   B.   Senior Citizen Housing: Seniors play an important role in the community
and are a growing faction of the local population. More quality senior housing
developments need to be encouraged, which will integrate within the single-
family low density zones and become an asset to the community. Assisted living
residential projects are encouraged throughout the community in facilities
constructed for that purpose. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.300: INFILL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT:
As Price continues to grow, residential development is encouraged to take place
on the remaining developable lots found throughout the community.
A mix of all types of housing is desired in the community, and new construction
is encouraged to take advantage of infill development opportunities.

ARTICLE VII. PARKS AND RECREATION
17.10.310: INTRODUCTION:
Price City recognizes the need to provide parks and recreation facilities and
services which enhance the quality of life of the residents. Included in the
scope and objectives for parks and recreation in Price are plans for
recreational trails, including bicycle, pedestrian and equestrian paths for
public use throughout the city. An emphasis is also given to supporting and
providing cultural activities and community services that enhance quality of
life.
An objective of Price City is to provide comprehensive recreation programs,
services, facilities and resources that allow and encourage participation by
all residents. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.320: PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN:
Like many communities throughout the U.S., Price City is experiencing a
continuing desire for more recreational opportunities. This creates the need
for a plan to meet the current and future recreational needs and desires of the
community. A parks and recreation master plan would provide a proactive "road
map" for guiding future planning, design and implementation decisions. The
implementation of such a plan, which would act as an appendix to this document,
will make the use of parks, trails and recreation facilities an integral part
of daily life in Price.
The beginnings of a parks and recreation master plan was developed through the
creation of this document, with public input provided though the general plan
update process, as described in the plan update section in article I of this
chapter. A map of existing and proposed facilities and locations was created
through this process (see "Parks, Recreation, And Trails, Exhibit 6", of this
article). (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.330: FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS:
Existing parks and recreation facilities in Price are a source of pride and
expertly maintained to high levels of safety and operation, providing
recreational facilities for residents and visitors.
Price City parks and recreation facilities include:
   A.   Desert Wave pool;
   B.   Washington park;
   C.   Pioneer park;
   D.   Terrace Hills park;
   E.   Underpass park;
   F.   Price City Peace Garden;
   G.   South Price park;
   H.   Detention Basin park;
   I.   Atwood Baseball Complex;
   J.   CEU Prehistoric Museum;
   K.   Heritage park;
   L.   Rose park;
   M.   Skate park;
   N.   BMX Track park.
Additional facilities adjacent to Price City boundaries, which are operated and
maintained by Carbon County include the county fairgrounds and sports complex,
motocross and model airplane airport. Also, proposed new parks, trails and open
space areas have been identified as shown in "Parks, Recreation, And Trails,
Exhibit 6", of this article. Many of the local recreation programs in Price are
currently administered through the Carbon County recreation department. As the
need expands for additional programs, the city may see the need to increase
involvement in programming through staffing and increased involvement on the
county recreation board. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.340: RECREATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM:
The quality of life in a community is enhanced when it has a system of
recreational trails, including bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian paths and
facilities. A trails system also acts as an asset to the city transportation
network. Increased levels of walking and bicycling due to the creation of these
facilities leads to a cleaner environment and a healthier population.
Safety for bicycles is an important issue. According to the "Bicycle And
Pedestrian Planning Guide, Parsons Brinckerhoff", Utah's bicycle fatality rate
is thirty six percent (36%) higher than the national average, which is caused
by a lack of safe bicycle corridors. Many local trips that Price residents
currently make in their cars might be made on foot or by bicycle if they could
do so on established safe trail corridors.
Where practical, bicycle and pedestrian paths in Price should: a) be separated
from vehicular traffic; b) be constructed with separated bike and pedestrian
lanes; and c) provide a connection between parks and open spaces.
Planning for equestrian and OHV recreational trails is also important to the
community of Price, in terms of both recreation and tourism. The planning and
development of such trails should be coordinated with county and regional
trails organizations.

(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.350: CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND FACILITIES:
Providing and fostering cultural institutions and activities which enhance the
community's quality of life is recognized as an important objective of the
Price community. Several programs have become a significant part of Price's
cultural life and character, which include the efforts of the Price City
culture connection, a community based organization to showcase the talents and
culture available in Price and surrounding communities. The city also sponsors
events such as the annual International Days, a festival which celebrates the
culture, heritage, food, music and arts of the community.
A source of community pride can be found in the College of Eastern Utah
Prehistoric Museum, located in the heart of the community, as well as the heart
of dinosaur country. A unique and celebrated facility, the museum boasts a wide
assortment of dinosaur fossils and ancient human artifacts.
Other civic and private organizations play important roles in the community
culture as well. Fostering an environment where such organizations can develop
and flourish is an ideal of the city which enjoys much support from the
community.

ARTICLE VIII. PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
17.10.360: INTRODUCTION:
This article addresses the various aspects and policies of public facilities,
services and activities in the city, including administrative offices, library,
public works and public safety facilities. The city, through its organizational
structure, administers the city water, wastewater, storm drainage, electrical
and other public facilities. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.370: MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES:
   A.   City Administration: Administration of the city organization occurs at
Price City hall, located in the downtown area at 185 East Main Street. Offices
and services found within this building are the mayor's office, city council/
planning commission chambers, administrative and finance offices, human
resources, community services, the city library, and the city auditorium.
Adjoining this building is the CEU Prehistoric Museum (see article VII of this
chapter).
The Price Municipal Corporation, the official name of the city organization, is
organized and operated with concern for providing efficient and effective
utilization of resources governmental services to the residents of the
community.
   B.   City Library: Located at 159 East Main Street in the city hall
building, the Price City library is the foremost library facility in Carbon
County and the region. The original Price City library was established in 1915,
through the Carnegie Library endowment program. In addition to an excellent
collection of books and printed resources, the library also maintains a supply
of computers and software, which are available to all library patrons.
Expanding and improving library services is a constant aspiration and goal of
the city.
   C.   Public Works: The Price City public works division strives to make the
city an accessible, functioning and healthy community. Located at 432 West 600
South, the "domes" house the offices for public works, engineering, water,
sewer, streets, fleet, city parks, the cemetery and the swimming pool. In
providing city services, the public works division endeavors to be organized,
trained and operate in an orderly and diligent process.
   D.   Public Utilities: Public utilities provided to the community by Price
City include sewer treatment, electrical power (through Utah Power and Light),
water and irrigation water. Garbage pick up is also administered through the
utilities department. The Price City utilities office is located in city hall,
at 185 East Main Street.
   E.   Police Department: Located at 81 North 200 East, the Price City police
department operates under a primary objective, which is:
A society free from crime and disorder remains an unachieved ideal;
nevertheless, consistent with the values of a free society, it is the primary
objective of the Price City police department to as closely as possible
approach that ideal. In so doing, the department's role is to enforce the law
in a fair and impartial manner, recognizing both the statutory and judicial
limitations of police authority and the constitutional rights of all persons.
It is not the role of the department to legislate, to render legal judgments,
or to punish.
   F.   Fire Department: The Price City fire department, located at 87 North
200 East, averages four hundred (400) calls per year. This highly trained full
service organization provides fire suppression and emergency medical services
twenty four (24) hours every day to the community. The department has twenty
four (24) trained "volunteer call firefighters". All firefighters are state
certified. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.380: EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT:
It is the objective of the city to support, where possible, the educational
institutions within the community, to emphasize the importance of education for
all citizens. A close working relationship needs to be maintained with the
Carbon County School District to encourage and facilitate the improvement of
elementary and secondary education in Price.
The city needs to actively participate in and support the growth and
development of the College of Eastern Utah, to understand the needs and impacts
of this noteworthy higher education institution. Support for continued programs
through the Utah State University Extension is likewise warranted. (Ord. 2004-
001, 2004)
17.10.390: COMMUNITY SERVICES:
   A.   Healthcare Support: To have good, quality healthcare and facilities
that meet the healthcare needs of the community is a primary goal of Price
City. Existing healthcare facilities, such as the IHC Castleview Hospital,
currently provide a foundation for quality healthcare. The health of the
community is an issue that should always concern city leaders. One method Price
City has identified to address healthcare issues and needs in the community is
the creation of healthcare committee, comprised of representatives of local
healthcare providers, governmental leaders and interested citizens. The tasks
of such a committee should include performing a comprehensive healthcare needs
assessment, and developing a community healthcare plan for continued and
improved services in Price. (See also appendix A, "Price City: A 21st Century
Community, Healthcare Issues", as referenced in the ordinance codified herein,
on file in the city.)
   B.   Telecommunications: Price City has strong interest and has taken a
proactive role in the planning and encouragement of updated and quality
telecommunication systems in the community. Sponsoring technology workshops and
hosting the Smart Utah Conference have brought the importance of using and
understanding telecommunications systems to the residents. Efforts to increase
the community's involvement and understanding of these systems is an ongoing
goal of the city.
Providing municipal business services to the community through internet
services, including utility department functions and business licensing, is a
city priority. (See also appendix A, "Price City: A 21st Century Community,
Telecommunications Issues", as referenced in the ordinance codified herein, on
file in the city.)

by the Price City planning and zoning commission may be considered while
waiting for a permanent through street.
DAIRY: A facility for the production of milk on a farm for wholesale marketing
off the premises shall be classified as a dairy. A commercial establishment for
the manufacture, processing or packaging of milk products, and their sale, is
not a dairy.
DENSITY: A measure of the number of dwelling units per acre of area. It shall
be expressed as dwelling units per acre (DU/acre). Unbuildable land (as defined
by the planning commission) is land with a slope greater than twenty five

proposes or causes improvements to be constructed, proposes or causes land use
to be changed, or land to be subdivided for themselves or others.
DEVELOPMENT (LAND): The conversion or alteration of use or physical

be used on watersheds larger than ten (10) acres. Peak rate and volume
calculations are to be based on the 100-year 24-hour storm event with a type 2
distribution for the storm drainage network.
            (3)   Postdevelopment conditions shall not exceed predevelopment
conditions. Check for the 5-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storms and related
flood routing. Delineate the watersheds for each catch basin and inlet. Design
the storm sewer pipe network for the 50-year 1-hour storm. Evaluate the effects
of the 100-year storm. Runoff and flooding shall be contained within the
streets and storm sewer pipeline network.
            (4)   Stormwater detention basins, inlets and outlets shall be
designed for the 100-year storm event.

grade away from all structures. Property owners shall be responsible for
controlling drainage runoff that is generated on site. On site detention shall
be developed as necessary. Discharge of runoff from the site shall be directed
towards approved street and natural drainageways.
         f.   Structures on lots shall not be built with basement garage
driveways or basement stair accesses that directly connect to the street.
         g.   Evaluation of potential pollution, contamination and construction
site discharge through stormwater runoff from the facilities or features of the
development. The results of the evaluation may require source control,
pretreatment and pollution prevention practices to be implemented to control
polluted stormwater runoff.
      9.   Survey Information: Plans for land surveying shall be prepared and
certification made as to plan accuracy by a registered professional land
surveyor properly licensed to do such work in the state. A workmanlike
execution of the plan shall be made in every detail. A poorly drawn or
illegible plan is sufficient cause for final plan rejection. Engineering plans
and details shall be calculated, designed, prepared or reviewed by a qualified
and licensed engineer. Plans shall provide the following survey information:
         a.   Bearings, distances and curve data for all perimeter boundary
lines with ties to two (2) existing legal survey monuments unless otherwise
required by the city engineer. A traverse of the perimeter boundary lines from
the existing legal survey monuments shall have an error of closure of not
greater than three (3) in one hundred (100). Bearings, distances and curve data
shall also be given for all interior lot lines and dimensions, including
irregularly shaped lots. Distances shall be given in hundredths of a foot,
angles in decimal degrees to hundredths of a degree, and bearings in degrees-
minutes-seconds of an arc.

and parcels to be dedicated to the public.
         e.   Parcels shall include area in acres.
         f.   All survey work, property descriptions, parcel closure and plan/
plat preparation shall be double checked by the city engineer.
   C.   As Built Construction Drawings:
      1.   As built construction drawings shall be submitted for all required
public improvements once constructed. Submission of as built construction
drawings will be required prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit or
release of the development agreement. Include any common facilities that could
ever apply for public acceptance or maintenance.
      2.   As built construction drawings shall be submitted in a paper copy
and in an electronic format contained on a compact disk. The format shall be
AutoCad, adobe acrobat or other format approved by the city engineer.

18.14.010: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: The purpose of this chapter and the intent of the
city in its adoption is to promote the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the city. This chapter
accomplishes the aforesaid purpose and intent by providing sufficient
flexibility to allow in certain areas compatible integration of uses which are
related to the permitted uses of the zoning district or are of a temporary
nature only, but which may be suitable and desirable only in certain locations
in that zoning district due to conditions and circumstances peculiar to that
location and/or upon certain conditions which make the uses suitable and/or
only if such uses are designed, laid out, and constructed on the proposed site
in a particular manner. While flexibility in allowing uses which would
otherwise be generally unsuitable in a given zoning district is an important
goal of this chapter, it is also recognized that constraints on governmental
decision making are a legal imperative. This chapter, therefore, also provides
a framework of standards within which those governmental decisions must be
made.
   B.   Conditional Use Permit Required: A conditional use permit shall be
required for all uses listed as conditional uses in this title and any proposed
uses not contemplated herein.
      1.   For the following types of conditional uses, final plan or plat
approval shall constitute the conditional use permit: (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
         a.   Subdivisions. A minor subdivision consisting of a one lot

the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city council.
   D.   Revocation Of Permit:
      1.   In the event any person holding a conditional use permit pursuant to
this chapter violates the terms of the permit, or conducts or carries on said
site development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health,
welfare or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the
property of the said permittee, a temporary suspension may be made effective
immediately upon notification by the zoning administrator.
      2.   No conditional use permit shall be permanently revoked or suspended
until review and approval of the revocation or suspension is completed by both
the planning and zoning commission and the city council. The permittee shall be
notified in writing of such review hearing, and said notification shall state:
         a.   The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation or
suspension, in clear and concise language.
         b.   The time and place such review hearing is to be held. Such notice
shall be served by certified mail or personal service on the permittee at least
five (5) days prior to the date set for the review hearing. At any such review
hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and may call
witnesses and present evidence on his/her behalf. Upon conclusion of such
review hearing, the city council shall determine whether or not the permit

from date of issue; except that the planning and zoning commission may, if the
permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that special circumstances or
unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within the
specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time, in up to one year
intervals, if written application is made and approved before the expiration of
the permit.
   G.   Grounds For Denial Of Permit Application: The following shall
constitute grounds for denial of a conditional use permit application:
      1.   Under circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will be
detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or
working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or improvements in the
vicinity and there is no practical means available to the applicant to
effectively mitigate said detrimental effects.
      2.   The applicant cannot or does not give the planning and zoning
commission reasonable assurance that conditions imposed incident to issuance of
a conditional use permit will be complied with.
      3.   Unsatisfactory past performance.
      4.   Requested conditional use is not permittable under the provisions of
this title.
   H.   Issuance Of Permit Dependent Upon Affirmative Findings: Conditional
uses may be approved by the city council upon recommendation of the planning

approval is granted, a report to the city council by the planning and zoning
commission shall find that the proposed development will meet the requirements
of this title.
      1.   Exceptions:
         a.   The planning and zoning commission may authorize exceptions to
any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter. Application
for any exception shall be made by a verified petition of the applicant stating
fully the grounds of the application and the facts relied upon by the
applicant. Such petition shall be filed with the conditional use permit
application. In order for the land referred to in the petition to come within
the provisions of this section, it is required that the planning and zoning
commission shall find all of the following with respect thereto:
            (1)   That the land is of such shape or size, or is affected by
such physical conditions, or is subject to such title limitations of record
that it is impossible or impractical for the developer to comply with all of
the regulations of this title.
            (2)   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right by the applicant.
            (3)   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the
subject property.

agencies involved, and such officers or departments shall transmit to the
planning and zoning commission their recommendations, which recommendations
shall be reviewed prior to the granting of any exceptions.
      2.   Approval By Planning And Zoning Commission: The planning and zoning
commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed exception, after which
it may approve the conditional use permit application with the exceptions and
conditions it deems necessary, or it may disapprove such conditional use permit
application. Any such approval or disapproval of requested exceptions will be
accompanied by written findings of fact and conclusions. The planning and
zoning commission or zoning administrator may require payment of fees
consistent with those approved by the city council by resolution to defray
costs associated with special meetings or public hearings.
   I.   Variances From Design And Improvement Standards: Where, in the opinion
of the planning and zoning commission, the literal enforcement of the design
and improvement standards in this title would result in an unreasonable
utilization of land and water, or undue hardship due to unique circumstances,
variances may be issued from one or more of the design and improvement
standards according to the following procedure:
      1.   Application for a variance shall be made to the planning and zoning
commission and shall include:
         a.   A description of the land to be developed;
         b.   An identification of the title provision from which the variance
is requested;

shall be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the
application and no less than fourteen (14) calendar days from the publication
of notice.
      3.   Subsequent to the public hearing, and within fifteen (15) calendar
days, or the next regularly scheduled council meeting, the city council shall
approve or deny the request for a variance. A variance shall be granted only if
the city council makes a finding upon the record submitted to it that the
issuance of a variance will be in the interest of the public safety, health or
welfare of the city and the proposed development substantially complies with
the city general plan and adopted zoning ordinance.
      4.   A record of all correspondence, recommendations, submissions and
official action regarding all variance applications shall be maintained by the
city as a public record, consistent with records retention law.
   J.   General Inspection: Following the issuance of a conditional use permit
by the city council, the zoning administrator, city engineer or building
inspector, shall inspect such use to ensure that development is undertaken and
completed in compliance with the conditional use permit.
   K.   Construction Shall Meet Or Exceed City Improvement Standards:
Construction standards, including drawings, details, calculations, tables,
charts, references and regulations may be adopted by resolution by the city
council, and when done so shall constitute minimum land development standards
supplementing this title. Additional standards may be required by conditional
use permit.
   L.   Conflicting Provisions: Where specific requirements are made or
exemptions allowed under other sections of this title, those requirements or
exemptions shall prevail over the land development standards supplementing this
title.
   M.   Improvement Construction To Be Obligation Of Developer: Improvements

mandatory:
      1.   The planning and zoning commission determines that existing streets
and thoroughfares are not suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic,
and increased densities resulting from the proposed use may generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the zoning district.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission determines that increases in
miscellaneous traffic, light, odor or environmental pollution generated by the
proposed use may significantly change the intended characteristics of the
zoning district as outlined in this title.
      3.   The planning and zoning commission determines that the architectural
design of the proposed use varies significantly from the architectural
characteristics of the zoning district (as outlined in this title) in which
such use is proposed. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.14.030: STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USE DEVELOPMENTS:
When applicable, the following general standards shall apply to all conditional
use developments within the city, unless waived or limited in application of
the development standard for good and sufficient reasons by the planning and
zoning commission:
   A.   Ownership: The development shall be in single, group or corporate
ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed
jointly by all owners of the property.
   B.   Landscaping, Fencing, Screening: Landscaping, fencing and screening
within the site and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its
surroundings shall be planned and presented to the planning and zoning
commission for approval, together with other required plans for the
development.
   C.   Signs, Lighting: The size, location, design and nature of signs, if
any, and the intensity and direction of lighting or floodlighting shall be
detailed in the application.
   D.   Grading, Drainage Plan: A grading and drainage plan shall be submitted
to the planning and zoning commission with the application.
   E.   Planting, Landscape Plan: A planting, landscaping plan showing the
proposed tree, shrubbery and lawn plantings shall be prepared for the entire
site to be developed, including especially the yards and parkways which abut
upon or are within the rights of way of public streets.
   F.   Use Not Detrimental: It shall be shown that under the circumstances of
the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health,
safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the
conditional use development.
   G.   Water And Sewer: All buildings used for human occupancy when completed
shall be served by a central water system and central sewage disposal system
which have been approved by the building official and which are in compliance
with applicable local and state law.
   H.   Bond Required: In order to ensure that the development will be
constructed to completion in accordance with approved plans, the planning and
zoning commission shall require the developer to post a surety bond, or
mortgage, or other valuable assurance acceptable to the city council, in an
amount equal to the estimated cost, plus ten percent (10%), of constructing all
required landscaping, fencing, street lighting, drainage, irrigation, road
improvements, pedestrianways, bike paths, curbs and gutters, hard surfacing,
drinking water and sewer lines, fire protection, and traffic control and
signals, as shown on the final site plan. Estimates of cost shall be furnished
by the developer, which will be checked for accuracy by the planning and zoning
commission staff. Final determination of the amount of the surety bond or other
assurance shall be approved and directed by the city council.
      1.   The duration of the bond or other assurance shall be for one or more
years from the date of approval of the development by the city council. An
extension of time for completion may be granted by the city council upon
application by the developer, provided such application is submitted at least
sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the surety bond or other assurance
and provided the issuer of the bond is willing to extend the time of the
assurance. Said assurance shall not expire prior to completion of the project
and approval of release by the city council.
      2.   In the event the developer defaults or fails or neglects to
satisfactorily install the required improvements within one year from the date
of approval and approved extensions of the development by the city council, or
to pay all liens in connection therewith, the city council may declare the
surety bond or other assurance forfeited, and the city shall install or cause
the required improvements to be installed using the proceeds from the
collection of the bond or other assurance to defray the expense thereof.
      3.   In the event there is a development requiring a conditional use
permit with the stipulation that a street right of way be dedicated and certain
improvements be completed within the right of way in front or adjacent to the
development, then the improvement may be guaranteed by one of two (2) options:
         a.   Complete the agreement and post a surety for a guarantee and
record the plat, thus allowing developer the ability to sell platted parcels
and apply for a building permit to construct a building prior to completing the
improvements in the right of way. However, in no case may the house receive an
occupancy permit prior to the completion of the improvements in the right of
way. The duration of the surety shall not expire prior to the completion of the
improvements.
         b.   Complete the agreement without submitting a surety for a
guarantee and without recording the plat, thus allowing the developer the
ability to complete the improvements without the expense of a surety for a
guarantee. However, the developer shall not be allowed to sell any parcels or
receive or apply for a valid building permit issued by the city until all of
the improvements are complete, a ten percent (10%) one year guarantee is posted
and the plat has been recorded. This would not apply to all conditional uses,
particularly where it does not involve a street dedication and/or street
improvements.
      4.   The developer shall be responsible for the quality of all materials
installed and workmanship. At the completion of the work, or not less than ten
(10) days prior to the release date of the surety bond or other assurance, the
city engineer shall make a preliminary inspection of the improvements made and
submit a report to the city council setting forth the condition of such
facilities. If all liens are paid and other conditions thereof are found to be
satisfactory, the city council shall release the surety bond or other
assurance. If the condition of material or workmanship shows unusual
depreciation or does not comply with the acceptable minimum standards,
standards required by conditional use permit, or durability, or if any
outstanding liens are not paid, the city council may declare the developer in
default.
   I.   Design According To Plans: In the event that the land contained within
a development is traversed by a proposed major street, water line, sewer line,
or drainage channel shown in the general plan or transportation master plan, or
described in a general plan element or map, said development shall be designed
in accordance therewith. The right of way across the development for such
transportation and circulation elements, or other right of way shall be deeded
to the city or dedicated to the public.
   J.   Residential Areas: Grouping and spacing of buildings and dwellings in
residential areas shall provide for a restful and uncrowded environment.
Landscaped areas shall be encouraged as the dominant feature of the
development. Areas not covered by buildings or by off street parking space or
driveways shall generally be planted/landscaped into natural vegetation, lawn,
trees and shrubs, and otherwise landscaped and maintained in accordance with
good landscape practice as approved on the final plan. Permanent automatic
irrigation systems shall be installed when required by the planning and zoning
commission to provide for maintenance of planted areas.
   K.   Plan Details: Details of plans, plats and documents to be submitted
showing the size of land, size of water lines, drainage lines, sewer lines and
other domestic sewage disposal facilities, garbage and trash disposal, the
quality of materials and improvements, protection from adverse influences,
lighting, landscaping, off street parking, grading and other details of design
and construction shall conform to standards as set forth in such resolutions
pertaining to such standards as may be adopted by the planning and zoning
commission.
   L.   Standards And Requirements: The development shall meet all standards
and requirements of this title and all requirements of applicable ordinances
and state law.
   M.   Character: The development shall be in keeping with the general
character of the zoning district within which it is to be located.
   N.   Plan Preparation: The planning and zoning commission (may require)
expects that details, drawings, plats and plans for the development be prepared
by a qualified professional team, licensed engineers, architects and surveyors.
In all cases, it is recommended that professional design and other assistance
be obtained early in the project program. It is the intent of the city that the
developer solves all the problems and addresses all issues before approval is
given and construction begins.
   O.   Storm Drainage: Storm drainage facilities shall be so constructed as to
protect residents of the development as well as adjacent property owners. Such
facilities shall be of sufficient capacity to ensure controlled drainage and
prevent the accumulation of stagnant pools of water in or adjacent to the
development.
   P.   Permits: All structures required by this title to have building permits
and all uses required to have use permits shall be inspected by the building
official in accordance with procedures established by the most recent edition
of the international building code, as adopted by the city, and this title;
provided, however, that no building permit for such structures or use permits
shall be issued until the planning commission, or the zoning administrator if
authorized by the planning and zoning commission and city council, has issued a
conditional use permit for the building site or use, or has determined that a
conditional use permit is not required by this title. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.14.040: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of planned unit development is to permit
flexibility in land use and to allow diversification in the interrelationships
of various uses and structures with their sites and thus offer an alternative
method to the traditional type of development. The application of planned unit
development concepts is intended to encourage neighborhoods, housing, design,
open space, and facilities compatible with the present living environment in
the city as described by the general plan, while at the same time ensuring
compliance with practices which will assure the health, safety and public
welfare of the future inhabitants of the planned unit development, as well as
maximizing the energy utilization efficiency of the project. In exchange for
the additional services provided by the developer in a planned unit
development, this chapter will allow for increased intensity of buildings and
more flexible uses of the land.
   B.   Condominiums Developed As Planned Unit Developments: Where, in the
opinion of the planning and zoning commission, the unique features of a
condominium project (i.e., ownership, financing, topography, types of land
uses, etc.) require more flexibility in design solutions in order to protect
the public interest, the proposed condominium project shall comply with the
provisions of this chapter. Any conflicting provision of another ordinance
adopted by the city may be waived by the planning and zoning commission, with
the approval of the city council, when the performance standards of the city
are achieved.
   C.   Planned Unit Developments To Meet Use Limitations Of Zoning Districts
Wherein Located: No conditional use permit for a planned unit development shall
be granted unless such development will meet the use limitations of the zoning
district in which it is to be located, including planned unit developments in
planned districts, and meet the density and other limitations of such
districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified (variance
approved) as provided by this chapter or by zoning district regulations.
Compliance with the regulations of this title in no sense excuses the
development from the applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations,
except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the approval of
the application for the planned unit development.
   D.   Required Conditions:
      1.   No planned unit development shall have an area less than that
approved by the planning and zoning commission as adequate for the proposed
development.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission shall require such arrangements
of structures and open spaces as necessary to assure that adjacent properties
will not be adversely affected. In particular:
         a.   Where feasible, buildings of the lowest height and the least
intensity of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the
development.
         b.   Lot area, width, yard, height, setback and coverage requirements
shall be determined by approval of the preliminary design plan.
         c.   Where feasible, buildings or landscaping shall not unreasonably
prohibit the free flow of air or direct exposure to sunlight, specifically in
regard to solar heating and/or cooling structures by solar energy systems.
         d.   The development will be planned so as to provide solar access to
all of the residential units, unless specifically waived by the planning and
zoning commission.
      3.   All plans must be prepared by a qualified professional team,
licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor.
      4.   Ownership of private open space reservations shall be established in
a manner acceptable to the city council and made a part of the conditions of
the plan approval.
   E.   Open Space Requirements: Preservation, maintenance and ownership of
required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by:
      1.   Dedication of the land to the city as a public park or parkway
system, including a certificate of title insurance; or
      2.   Granting to the city a permanent and perpetual open space easement
on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space
remains perpetually in recreational or park use, with ownership and maintenance
being the responsibility of an owners' association established with articles of
association and bylaws which are satisfactory to the city council and
enforceable by the city council; or
      3.   Granting to the city a permanent and perpetual open space easement
on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space
remains perpetually in recreational or park use, to be maintained from the
proceeds of a perpetual maintenance trust fund established by the developer in
an amount satisfactory to the city council; or
      4.   Complying with the provisions of the condominium ownership act, Utah
Code Annotated title 57, chapter 8, as amended, which provides for the payment
of common expenses for the upkeep of the common areas and facilities. (Ord.

Manufactured and modular homes may be allowed in traditional residential
subdivisions that are specifically approved by conditional use for such homes.
      2.   Recreational coaches which do not include facilities necessary to be
manufactured or mobile homes, as defined in section
18.02.130 of his title, shall not be used at any place within the corporate
boundaries of the city, at any time, for living quarters except in designated
camping areas or recreational coach parks.
      3.   Recreational coaches which are unoccupied for living space may be
temporarily stored on a private residential lot or larger parcel of land,
provided they do not violate any required setbacks for front or side yards.
Long term storage of recreational coaches, maintenance operations,
reconstruction or construction activities are permitted within enclosures only
and in zoning districts allowing such uses.
   C.   Standards And Requirements For All Manufactured, Modular, Mobile Home
And Recreational Vehicle Parks, And Manufactured, Modular And Mobile Home
Subdivisions:
      1.   The planning and zoning commission shall review the proposed
development plan to determine its compliance with all portions of the city
general plan and, among other things, shall attempt to make sure that such
development will constitute an environment of sustained desirability and
stability and that it will not adversely affect amenities in the surrounding
area. Standards higher than the minimum standards contained in this title may
be required if necessary for local conditions of health, safety and protection
of property, and to ensure that the development will mix harmoniously with
contiguous and nearby existing and planned uses.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission shall not approve any application
for a manufactured, modular, mobile home or recreational vehicle park, or
manufactured, modular or mobile home subdivision conditional use permit if the
developer cannot provide required water supplies and facilities, fire
protection, waste disposal systems, storm drainage facilities, access or
improvements, or if the developer cannot assure that the development will be
completed within twelve (12) months, or if the planning and zoning commission
or city council determines there would be unusual danger of flood, wind, fire
or other hazard, or if the proposed development would be of such character or
in such a location that it would:
         a.   Create excessive costs for public services and facilities;
         b.   Endanger the health or safety of the public;
         c.   Unreasonably hurt or destroy the environment;
         d.   Cause excessive air or water pollution or soil erosion; or
         e.   Be inconsistent with any adopted general or specific plan of the
area in which it is to be placed.
      3.   The development shall conform to the following standards and
requirements, unless modified by an approved planned unit development plan:
         a.   The area shall be in single ownership, or if in several, the
application for approval of the development shall be filed jointly by all
owners of the property included in the plan.
         b.   A strip of land at least fifteen feet (15') wide surrounding the
entire park shall be left unoccupied by manufactured, modular or mobile homes,
recreational vehicles, storage buildings, service buildings, garages or any
add-ons, and shall be planted and maintained in lawn, shrubs, trees, and an
irrigation/sprinkler system, with an approved durable sight obscuring permanent
wall or fence designed to afford privacy to the development.
         c.   All storage and solid waste receptacles outside the confines of
any manufactured, modular or mobile home or recreational vehicle shall be
housed in a closed, view obscuring structure, compatible in design and
construction to the manufactured, modular or mobile homes, and to any service
buildings within the development; all patios, carports, garages and other add-
ons shall be compatible in design and construction with the manufactured,
modular or mobile home. The service buildings shall be constructed in
accordance with standard commercial practice and kept in good repair as
determined by the zoning administrator. In manufactured, modular or mobile home
developments where units will be situated with long axis perpendicular to the
street, streets will run in a north-south direction to the greatest extent
possible. This is to promote solar orientation of the units.
      4.   In addition to meeting the above requirements and conditions, and
conforming to the other laws of the city, all manufactured, modular and mobile
home parks, recreational vehicle parks, and manufactured, modular and mobile
home subdivisions shall also conform to all applicable state regulations. In
the event of any conflict between said regulations and this chapter, this
chapter shall take precedence where its regulations are more strict, and the
provisions of the state regulations shall take precedence where such
regulations are more strict.
   D.   Underground Utilities: Every manufactured, modular or mobile home park,
recreational vehicle park, and mobile home subdivision shall provide
underground utility service to every mobile home stand or lot as required by
the planning and zoning commission, including, but not limited to, water,
sewer, electricity, natural gas, telephone and TV.
   E.   Compliance With Other Regulations: Any manufactured, modular or mobile
home or recreational vehicle located in any permitted area shall comply with
and conform to all other zoning laws, rules, regulations, and building,
plumbing, electrical, fire prevention, and all other codes and requirements
applicable to a structure or building erected within the zoning district in
which said mobile home or recreational vehicle is located.
   F.   Guarantees:
      1.   For manufactured, modular and mobile home parks and recreational
vehicle parks, adequate and reasonable guarantees must be provided as
determined by the planning and zoning commission and city council for permanent
retention of open spaces, and for the maintenance of roadways, storage
facilities, service facilities and landscaping resulting from the application
of these regulations. Guarantees shall be in the form of a surety bond, or a
cash deposit, in the sum to be determined by the planning and zoning
commission, which form must be approved by the city council and the city
attorney. The basis for providing assurance of compliance will be a management
plan developed by the applicant and approved by the planning and zoning
commission and city council that will outline standards of operation, remedies
for failure to comply with those standards and a single responsible person or
entity for its administration and dealing with the city.
      2.   In any case, when a manufactured, modular or mobile home park or
recreational vehicle park is owned by more than one person, the developer shall
establish and appoint a park manager. The manager shall be authorized to
receive, process, and represent fully the interests of the owners in respect to
continuing management and maintenance of the park.
      3.   Prerequisite to the operation of any manufactured, modular or mobile
home park or recreational vehicle park in the city shall be the obtaining of an
annual business license from the city.
      4.   In the event a manufactured, modular or mobile home or recreational
vehicle park is not completed according to approved plans, or operated and
maintained according to the approved management plan, the annual business
license may be denied or revoked. The manufactured, modular or mobile homes or
recreational vehicles and associated property and facilities shall be removed
and all services discontinued before any part of the land within the
development planning area may be used for any other purpose, or be subdivided.
      5.   The premises on which any manufactured, modular or mobile home is
located, used or occupied shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and sanitary
condition. The accumulation of any rubbish, waste, weeds, inoperative vehicles,
or other unsightly material thereon, shall constitute a public nuisance and a
violation of this title.
      6.   Reasonable guarantees to assure compliance with this requirement
will be required of the developer and/or owner as a requirement of conditional
use permit approval and ultimately the issuance of the annual city business
license.

18.14.060: LAND FILLS, GRADING EXCAVATIONS, BACKFILLING AND COMPACTION; SPECIAL
REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: This section is adopted to promote public safety
and the general public welfare; to protect property against loss from erosion,
earth movement, rock fall, landslide, subsidence, collapse, cave in, dust and
flooding; to maintain a superior community environment; to provide for the
continued orderly growth of the city; and to ensure the maximum preservation of
the natural scenic character of major portions of the city by establishing
minimum standards and requirements relating to land grading, excavations and
fills, and procedures by which these standards and requirements may be
enforced. It is intended that this section be administered with the foregoing
purposes in mind and specifically in an attempt to:
      1.   Ensure that the development of each site occurs in a manner
harmonious with adjacent lands so as to minimize problems of drainage, erosion,
earth movement and similar hazards.
      2.   Ensure the public lands and places, watercourses, streets, and all
other lands in the city are protected from erosion, earth movement and drainage
hazards.
      3.   Ensure that the planning, design and construction of all development
will be done in a manner which provides maximum safety and human enjoyment and,
except where specifically intended otherwise, makes such construction as
unobtrusive in the natural terrain as possible. Complete a geotechnical report
evaluating existing conditions, develop recommendations for earthwork activity
and identify precautions.
      4.   Ensure, where practicable, the maximum retention of natural
vegetation to aid in protection against erosion, earth movement and other
hazards and to aid in preservation of the natural scenic qualities of the city.
   B.   Permit Required; Exceptions:
      1.   No person shall commence or perform any grading or excavation,
including those in gravel pits and rock quarries, in excess of the limits
specified below, without first obtaining a conditional use permit for such
grading or excavation.
      2.   In this subsection, all references to conditional use permit shall
mean a conditional use permit for grading, backfilling or excavation. (See also
chapter 18 of the international building code, soils and foundations.)
      3.   A conditional use permit shall be required in all cases where
development comes under any one or more of the following provisions, unless
such work is otherwise exempted elsewhere in this chapter:
         a.   Excavation, fill or any combination thereof, exceeding five
thousand (5,000) cubic yards. Excavation or fill within a known mapped 100-year
floodplain.
         b.   Fill exceeding ten feet (10') in vertical depth at its deepest
point measured from the adjacent undisturbed ground surface.
         c.   An excavation exceeding five feet (5') in vertical depth at its
deepest point.
         d.   An excavation, fill or combination thereof exceeding an area of
five (5) acres.
         e.   Vegetation removal from an area in excess of five (5) acres.
      4.   A conditional use permit shall not be required in the following
cases:
         a.   Excavations below finished grade for which a building permit is
required and has been issued by the city, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            (1)   Septic tanks and drain fields;
            (2)   Tanks;
            (3)   Vaults;
            (4)   Tunnels;
            (5)   Equipment basements;
            (6)   Swimming pools;
            (7)   Cellars; or
            (8)   Footings for buildings or structures.
         b.   Excavation or removal of vegetation within property owned by

and/or in appropriate industrial zones as provided for in this title.
         f.   Engineered interior fills or surcharge on the property with
respect to industrial development.
         g.   Items not covered by this chapter which are exempted from
required permits by this title and the building code of the city.
         h.   Grading and/or excavation done pursuant to an approved final
development or subdivision plan.
   C.   Responsibility: Failure of the city officials to observe or recognize
excavation or fill work, hazardous or unsightly conditions, or to recommend
denial of the conditional use permit, or of the planning and zoning commission
to deny said permit, shall not relieve the permittee from making application
for a permit and from responsibility for appropriately doing the work or
damages resulting therefrom.
   D.   Retention Of Plans: Plans, specifications and reports, for all
excavation or fill work and conditional use permit applications, shall be
retained by the property owner.
   E.   Inspections:
      1.   The zoning administrator, building official, building inspector or
city engineer shall make the inspections hereinafter required and shall either
approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee
wherein the same fails to comply with this section. Where it is found by
inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or shown in the
conditional use permit application, the inspector may stop further work until
and unless approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the
existing conditions.
      2.   Plans for grading work, approved by the planning and zoning
commission, shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the grading.
      3.   In order to obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the city
at least forty eight (48) hours before said inspection is to be made.
   F.   Standards And Specific Requirements:
      1.   Applicability: All grading and excavation shall comply with the
requirements set forth in this chapter, in addition to other requirements of
this title.
      2.   Hours Of Operation: All grading and excavation in or contiguous to
residential neighborhoods shall be carried on between the hours of seven
o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock (7:00) P.M., seven (7) days a week. The
zoning administrator, city engineer or building inspector may waive this
requirement if it is shown that restricting the hours of operation would unduly
interfere with the development of the property and it is shown that other
properties or neighborhood values would not be adversely affected.
      3.   Dust And Dirt Control: All graded or disturbed surfaces of
excavations, and all equipment materials and roadways on the site, shall be
dampened or suitably treated, managed or contained to prevent clouds of dust
and the deposit of dust on neighboring properties or streets; all materials
transported to or from the site shall be so contained during transportation as
to prevent spillage on the street or other property outside of the site.
Tracking of mud and debris by the wheels or tracks of vehicles and equipment
will be prevented by setting up an area (drain rock pad) on site for the
vehicles and equipment to drive over to loosen mud and debris. Failure to
control dust and dirt may result in suspension or revocation of conditional use
permit and/or building permit.
      4.   Slopes: The zoning administrator, city engineer or building
inspector may require the percent of slope of a cut or fill to be reduced if it
is found that the cut or fill is subject to unusual or excessive erosion,
caving or sliding, or if other conditions make such requirements necessary for
stability. Steeper slopes may be permitted where the material being cut is
unusually stable.
      5.   Fill Material: All fill, except in publicly approved refuse disposal
or other landfill operations, shall be earth, rock, or other inert materials
free from organic material, metal, asphalt, petroleum products, toxins or other
hazardous materials, except that topsoil spread on cut and fill surfaces may
incorporate humus for desirable moisture retention and plant growth.
      6.   Drainage: Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface
waters from damaging any excavation or any portion of a fill and adversely
impacting adjacent properties. A stormwater protection and prevention plan
shall be designed and implemented. Drainage, storm runoff and testing
discharges shall be controlled and channeled to the most practical drainage
pathway such as a detention pond, ditch canal, wash, creek, river, street or
storm drain. Drainage structures shall be constructed or installed as necessary
to prevent erosion damage or to prevent saturation of the fill or natural
material, at the foot of or behind cut slopes and walls.
      7.   Finished Cuts And Slopes: The exposed or finished cuts or slopes of
any fill or excavation shall be smoothly graded. Exposed slopes of any cut or
fill shall be protected by erosion control and approved planting, crib walls,
retaining walls, fabrics or walls and planting, terracing, or a combination
thereof.
      8.   Backfill: Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in
any slope of any excavation or filled site shall be backfilled in lifts and
compacted to the level of the surrounding grade.
      9.   Compaction Of Fills: Unless otherwise directed by the zoning
administrator, city engineer or building inspector, all fills governed by this
title intended to support buildings, structures, or where otherwise required to
be compacted for stability, shall be compacted, inspected and tested in
accordance with the following provisions, unless otherwise dictated by a
geotechnical/soils report:
         a.   The natural ground surface shall be prepared by removal of
vegetation and, if necessary, shall be graded to a series of terraces.
         b.   The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not
exceeding twelve inches (12") in thickness, and shall be compacted by
"sheepsfoot" roller compactor (after each layer is spread) or other acceptable
method approved by the city engineer.
         c.   The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at
the time of spreading and compaction to obtain required maximum density.
         d.   The fill material after compaction shall have an average dry
density of not less than ninety five percent (95%) of maximum dry density and a
minimum of ninety percent (90%) in all portions of the fill requiring
compaction as determined by the AASHO soil compaction test method T99-57 or
T180-57, or other acceptable testing method.
         e.   A written report of the compaction, showing location, boundaries
and depth of test holes, materials used, moisture conditions, recommended soil
bearing pressures, and relative density obtained from all tests, prepared by a
civil engineer or soils engineer licensed by the state, shall be submitted to
the zoning administrator, building inspector or city engineer.
         f.   The zoning administrator, city engineer or building inspector may
require additional tests or information if, in their opinion, the conditions or
materials are such that additional information is necessary, and may modify or
delete any of the above listed requirements that in their opinion are
unnecessary to further the purpose of this title.
      10.   Erosion Control And Landscaping: All cut and fill surfaces created
by grading, except for firebreak purposes, shall be planted with a ground cover
that is compatible with the natural ground covers in the city. Topsoil is to be
stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes. When slopes
too steep to support continuous ground cover have been permitted and, in lieu
thereof, niches and ledges provided for planting, such slopes need not be
planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines
and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be
landscaped so as to blend into the natural surroundings.
      11.   Filling For Agricultural And Fire Protection Purposes: Filling of
the ground for agricultural or fire protection purposes shall be accomplished
with such practices as will prevent erosion and damage to natural drainage
channels.
      12.   Final Inspection:
         a.   If upon final inspection of any grading it is found that the work
authorized by the conditional use permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this title and any other requirements
imposed, the zoning administrator, city engineer or building inspector shall so
record in the record.
         b.   The zoning administrator, city engineer or building inspector
shall have the authority to revoke any conditional use permit whenever it is
found that the work covered by the certificate has been materially extended or
altered without prior approval, or that any planting, retaining walls,
cribbing, drainage structures, or other protective devices as shown on the
approved plans and specifications submitted with the application for a permit
have not been maintained in good order and repair. Said revocation shall remain
until the problems and nonconformance are corrected.
      13.   Prohibited Activities:
         a.   The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as
permitting the removal of topsoil solely for resale, or of permitting quarrying
of any site within the limits of the city, unless in a zoning district allowing
such activities.
         b.   This chapter shall also not be construed as authorizing any
person to maintain a private or public nuisance upon his or her property, and
compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any
action to abate such nuisance.
         c.   Filling the 100-year floodway. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.14.070: SUBDIVISIONS (LAND DEVELOPMENT); SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Scope Of Section:

every lot in the development. The sewerage system shall meet the minimum
standards and requirements of the city, the health department, and the Price
River water improvement district. A sewer system capacity study shall be
completed by the developer as required to determine availability of downstream
sewer pipeline condition, capacity and special sewerage treatment requirements.
         b.   Septic tanks and/or sealed vaults may be approved only when an
existing sanitary sewer system is more than one-half (1/2) mile from the
boundary of the development and shall be disapproved in any case unless
approved in writing by the building official and the health department. In
order to determine the adequacy of the soil and geology involved to properly
absorb sewage effluent and to determine the minimum lot area required for such
installations, an interpretive map based on the natural resources conservation
service soil survey showing the suitability of the soil for septic tank fields
or pits shall be submitted, along with the results of percolation tests. The
results of these data will be reviewed by the health department and the
building official, in addition to any other information available to them, for
recommendations to the planning and zoning commission. The following
requirements shall be met:
            (1)   Land altered, or filled with nonearth materials within the
last ten (10) years shall not be divided into building sites which are to be
served by soil absorption waste disposal systems.
            (2)   Each developed lot to be served by an on site soil absorption
sewerage disposal system shall contain an adequate site for such system. An
adequate site requires a minimum depth of eight feet (8') from the surface of
the ground, impermeable bedrock, and a minimum depth of six feet (6') from the
surface of the ground to the ground water surface (based on annual high water
level). Each site must also be at least one thousand five hundred feet (1,500')
from any shallow water supply well, and three hundred feet (300') from any
stream or watercourse, and at least fifty feet (50') from any dwelling or
property line.
            (3)   Soils having a percolation rate slower than or faster than
standards allowed by the building official or the health department shall not
be divided into building sites to be served by soil absorption sewage disposal
systems.
            (4)   Land rated as having severe limitations for septic tank
absorption fields, as defined by the local county soil survey, U.S. department
of agriculture, natural resources conservation service, shall not be divided
into building sites to be serviced by soil absorption sewage disposal systems,
unless each such building site contains not less than twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet of other soils rated suitable for building construction and
installation of an on site soils absorption sewage disposal system.
            (5)   An applicant desiring to install soil absorption sewage
disposal facilities on the soils having severe limitations, as determined in
the preliminary plan review, shall have additional on site investigations made,
including percolation tests; obtain the certification of a soils scientist that
specific areas lying within these soils are suitable for the proposed soil
absorption sewage disposal system; and meet building official and state
division of health standards and regulations. In addition, the building

      18.   Sanitary Sewer Mains, Laterals And House Connections; Future: Where
local, county and regional master or general plans indicate that construction
or extension of sanitary sewers may serve the development area within a
reasonable time, the planning and zoning commission may require the
installation and capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections by the
developer, in addition to the installation of temporary individual on lot
sanitary disposal systems by the developer or lot purchaser. Whenever
individual on lot sanitary sewage disposal systems are proposed, the developer
shall either install such facilities or require by deed restrictions or
otherwise as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel within such
development that on lot sanitary sewage disposal facilities be installed by the
purchaser of said lot at the time the principal building is constructed, and no
building permit shall be issued until such installation is assured. In all
other cases, sanitary disposal facilities for sewage shall be provided for
every lot or parcel by a complete community or public sanitary system. All
sewer mains shall be a minimum of eight inches (8") in diameter. Larger size
sewer mains will be installed as recommended by sewer study.
      19.   Test Procedures: Tests of sanitary sewer mains, laterals and house
connections shall be conducted in accordance with local and state health
requirements. As built drawings will be submitted, along with installation and
testing reports. The city's approval will be required before putting the system
in service.
      20.   Water In Sufficient Quantity To Be Obligation Of Developer:
         a.   The procurement of water, as required by the city council, shall
be by purchase of water rights, water shares, exchange or service agreement,
and shall be the responsibility of the developer. There shall be water
available for use in the development in an amount sufficient to meet minimum
flows of two hundred fifty (250) gallons per person per day, plus outside
irrigation and minimum static pressures of fifty (50) pounds per square inch
(psi) with a fire flow requirement of one thousand (1,000) gallons per minute.
The minimum pressure and flow may be increased based on project impact. There
shall be adequate water resources, treatment, storage, transmission and
distribution to service the project.
         b.   In no event shall the quantity of water provided by the developer
be less than that required to meet minimum fire flow standards.
      21.   Culinary Water System: The culinary water delivery system shall
extend to the property line of every lot and shall be capable of delivering the
flows and pressures as required. All water mains shall be a minimum of eight
inches (8") in diameter, unless required to be larger based on a water system
study. Plan and profiles design drawing will be submitted. As built drawings
will be submitted, along with installation and testing reports. The city's
approval will be required before putting the system in service.
      22.   Irrigation Systems (Including Drainage Facilities):
         a.   Where an existing irrigation system consisting of open ditches is
located on or adjacent to or within one hundred feet (100') of a proposed
development, complete plans for relocation, piping, covering or other safety
precautions shall be submitted with an application for preliminary approval of
a plat. An easement for the irrigation route shall be required.
         b.   In all developments, irrigation systems shall be underground with
cleanouts of a type and in such amounts as may be deemed acceptable by the city
engineer.
         c.   All pressure irrigation systems in or within one hundred feet
(100') of a proposed development shall be identified and otherwise color coded
(purple) as to pipe and valve color to meet local and state standards and
regulations, and to prevent cross connections and contamination.
      23.   Permit Required: A conditional use permit shall be required prior
to the construction of any development. Final plan approval shall constitute
such conditional use permit for any development.
   M.   Storm Drainage And Floodplains:
      1.   Complete drainage systems for the entire development area shall be
designed by an engineer licensed in the state and qualified to perform such
work, and shall be shown on a drawing. All existing drainage features which are
to be incorporated in the design shall be so identified. If the final plat is
to be presented in sections, a general drainage plan for the entire area shall
be presented with the first section, and appropriate development stages for the
drainage system for each section indicated.
      2.   The drainage and floodplain systems shall be designed to:
         a.   Permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
         b.   Ensure adequate drainage of all low points.
         c.   Ensure compliance with development in designated floodplains in
accordance with the national flood insurance program, rate maps, city
floodplain ordinance and in other areas of suspected flooding.
            (1)   Construction of buildings shall not be permitted in a known
or formally designated floodway.
            (2)   Building construction may occur in that portion of the
designated floodplain (flood fringe) where the return frequency is one hundred
(100) years, provided all usable floor space is constructed above the
designated maximum probable base flood elevation.
      3.   Where flow velocities in a floodplain are generally determined to be
under five feet (5') per second and maximum flood depth will not exceed three
feet (3'), such uses as cultivated agriculture, nurseries, parks and recreation
facilities and accessory parking may be permitted. Warning signs shall be
posted and maintained.
      4.   Any use of land is prohibited where flooding would create a public
health hazard or problem. This includes shallow wells, noncased deep wells,
sanitary landfills, septic tank and on lot sewage disposal systems, water
treatment plants, and also sewage disposal systems not completely protected
from inundation.
      5.   Any contemplated floodplain encroachment or channeling shall be
thoroughly analyzed and its effect on stream flow determined before such
encroachment is undertaken. Any construction, dumping and filling operations in
a designated floodplain constitute an encroachment and must be approved by the
planning commission before accomplishment.
      6.   The drainage basin as a whole shall accommodate not only runoff from
the development area but also, where applicable, the system shall be designed
to accommodate the runoff from those areas adjacent to and "upstream" from the
development itself, as well as its effects on lands downstream.
      7.   All proposed surface drainage structures shall be indicated on the
plans.
      8.   All appropriate designs, details and dimensions needed to clearly
explain proposed construction materials and elevations shall be included in the
drainage plans, to include on site detention.
   N.   Analysis And Design Criteria:
      1.   The rational method is to be employed for watersheds less than or
equal to ten (10) acres. Peak rate and volume calculations are to be based on
the 50-year 1-hour storm for the storm drainage network. Use an intensity of
1.10 inches per hour for one hour or other local reliable precipitation data.
      2.   The natural resource conservation service (NRCS) method is to be
used on watersheds larger than ten (10) acres. Peak rate and volume
calculations are to be based on the 100-year 24-hour storm event with a type 2
distribution for the storm drainage network.
      3.   Postdevelopment conditions shall not exceed predevelopment
conditions. Check for the 5-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storms and related
flood routing. Delineate the watersheds for each catch basin and inlet. Design
the storm sewer pipe network for the 50-year 1-hour storm. Evaluate the effects
of the 100-year storm. Runoff and flooding shall be contained within the
streets and storm sewer pipeline network.
      4.   Stormwater detention basins, inlets and outlets shall be designed
for the 100-year storm event.
      5.   Each lot will be developed and built upon such that there is a
positive grade away from all structures. Property owners shall be responsible
for controlling drainage runoff that is generated on site and impacts from off
site runoff. On site detention shall be developed as necessary. Discharge of
runoff from on site shall be directed towards approved street and natural
drainageways.
      6.   Structures on lots shall not be built with basement garage driveways
or basement stair accesses that directly connect to the street.
      7.   Evaluation of potential pollution, contamination and construction
site discharge through stormwater runoff from the facilities or features of the
development. The results of the evaluation may require source control,
pretreatment and pollution prevention practices to be implemented to control
polluted stormwater runoff. Prepare and submit a "stormwater pollution
protection plan", according to local and/or state regulations.
      8.   On site drainage shall not negatively impact adjacent properties or
development. Alteration to existing water routes or channels shall not impact
adjacent properties or development. Work within mapped floodplain areas will
require a stream channel alteration permit through the state.
      9.   All necessary permits shall be obtained from applicable local, state
and federal agencies (i.e., state engineer, U.S. army corps of engineers, state
division of health, etc.). (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)

18.20.140: RESIDENTIAL ESTATE DISTRICT, RE:
   A.   Objectives And Characteristics: The objective in establishing the
residential estate district, RE, is to encourage the creation and maintenance
of a residential environment within an area which is characterized by large
lots (minimum of one acre) on which single-family dwellings are situated,
surrounded by settings in which the predevelopment natural character of the
landscape is retained. Native plant species, wildlife habitats, low water
consumptive landscapes, minimum vehicular traffic, private lanes connected to
public streets, featured or gated entries, building products produced from
natural materials, and quiet residential conditions are also characteristic of
this zone. While much of this zone is currently devoted to open land uses, it
is intended that the land shall be developed into residential uses as the needs
arise, having characteristics as herein above set forth. The minimum area for
an RE district shall be ten (10) acres. Representative of the uses within the
RE district are one-family dwellings, caretaker cottages (not to exceed one per
lot), parks and playgrounds. Boarding and lodging houses, two-family dwellings,
triplexes, apartment houses and other multiple dwellings representative of
higher density residential areas are strictly prohibited in this zone.
Commercial and industrial uses are strictly prohibited. In order to accomplish
the objectives and purpose of this chapter, and to promote the characteristics
of this zone, the following precise regulations shall apply to the residential
estate district, RE.

18.20.170: ACCESSORY DWELLINGS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish use and
development regulations for accessory dwelling units (ADU). These regulations
are adopted for the following purposes:
      1.   To allow city residents to house elderly parents, disabled relatives
and other family members under conditions where those family members can enjoy
a degree of independence while also having assistance readily available when
needed.
      2.   To accommodate such housing in single-family residential
neighborhoods with minimal impacts on the neighborhood in terms of traffic,
noise, parking, congestion, and compatible scale and appearance of residential
buildings.
      3.   To prevent the proliferation of rental dwellings, absentee
ownership, property disinvestment, building code violations, and associated
decline in quality of single-family residential neighborhoods.
      4.   To establish uniform standards for ADUs.
   B.   Scope: The requirements of this section shall apply to any ADU within
the city. Such requirements shall not be constructed to prohibit or limit other
applicable provisions of this title, and other laws. An ADU that conforms to
the development standards of subsection C of this section shall be subject to a
conditional use permit in all residential zones.
   C.   Development Standards; Permitted Use: The development standards set
forth in this section shall apply to any ADU allowed as a conditional use:
      1.   Location: An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) shall be allowed only
within or attached to an owner occupied single- family dwelling. In addition,
an ADU shall not be allowed on a lot or parcel which fronts onto a street
(whether a public or private street) which has a paved roadway less than thirty
feet (30') wide.
      2.   Number Of Accessory Dwelling Units And/Or Guesthouses: A maximum of
one ADU shall be allowed within or attached to each owner occupied single-
family dwelling. No lot or parcel shall simultaneously include an ADU and a
guesthouse.
      3.   Parking: A single-family dwelling with an ADU shall provide at least
three (3) off street parking stalls conforming with the city parking standards
specified elsewhere in this title. No more than two (2) parking stalls shall be
within the side or rear yard setbacks adjacent to a street. No parking for the
ADU shall be allowed within the front yard setback area. Parking stalls shall
be paved with concrete, masonry or concrete pavers. Gravel parking stalls or
driveways may be allowed at the discretion of the zoning administrator;
provided, that the structure to be used as an ADU was in existence at the time
of adoption hereof, the structure was accessed or served by a gravel driveway
and/or parking stalls at the time of adoption hereof, and the surface is
sufficient to allow for access by public safety vehicles.
      4.   Utility Metering: No separate utility metering for the ADU shall be
allowed, and the utility service shall be in the property owner's name.
      5.   Minimum And Maximum Size Of Accessory Dwelling Unit: An ADU shall
not be larger than the single-family dwelling to which it is accessory. An ADU
is not subject to other minimum or maximum square footage requirements;
provided, that dimensions and sizes of living areas, kitchen areas, sleeping
areas and bathroom facilities shall comply with applicable provisions of the
international building code and the international housing code as may be
adopted by the city.
      6.   Construction Codes: An ADU shall comply with the construction
housing codes in effect at the time the ADU is constructed, created as a
separate dwelling, or subsequently remodeled. This shall include the obtaining
of a building or other permits as the codes may require.
      7.   Building Entrances: An ADU that is added on to an existing single-
family dwelling or is part of an approved new single- family dwelling shall not
have a separate entrance, the sole purpose of which is to provide access to the
ADU at the front or side of the building facing a street.
      8.   Architecture: An ADU that is added on to an existing single-family
dwelling or a new single-family dwelling that is designed to accommodate an ADU
shall not resemble a multi- family structure in terms of the scattered
placement of garage doors, carports, or number or location of outside entries
or porches. The architectural design and materials of an addition for an ADU
shall match the existing single-family dwelling so that the addition appears to
be part of the original building.
      9.   Access Between Units: An unrestricted passage shall exist between an
ADU and the principal single-family dwelling in which it is located. Use of
such passage shall not require going out of doors, using a key, or passing
through a garage or unfinished part of the dwelling.
      10.   Compensation: The property owner shall not charge any rent or other
form of compensation for the use of the ADU by any occupant thereof.
   D.   Conditional Use: If a proposed ADU does not satisfy the requirements
set forth in subsection C of this section, no additional dwelling may be
created unless a conditional use permit for a second dwelling has been approved
in accordance with city regulations regarding the establishment of a second
dwelling unit on property ordinarily restricted to only one dwelling unit.
   E.   Notice: Upon approval of an accessory dwelling unit permit by the city,
the owner of the property where the ADU is located shall execute a notice of
accessory dwelling unit approval. Such notice shall define the approved use and
any restrictions or conditions of approval. The city shall record the notice
with the county recorder. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)

CHAPTER 18.24
SENSITIVE AREA DISTRICT, SA
SECTION:
18.24.010: Purpose And Intent
18.24.020: Permitted Uses
18.24.030: Conditional Uses
18.24.040: General Provisions
18.24.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of the SA district is to designate and describe those areas
within the municipality that possess physical and/or environmental
characteristics which require special public consideration of use applications
which might affect the structure or the land, the management of surface or
subsurface water, safety of future land occupants due to increased fire,
earthquake, rockfall, flooding or storm hazards within the proposed
development, or the uneconomic extension of public facilities and services. Of
specific concern is development in flood prone areas, earthquake zones,
landslide areas, areas of steep slope or unstable soils, rockfall, wetlands,
and other sensitive areas requiring careful assessment prior to alteration.
   B.   It is the intent of these regulations to permit the widest possible
latitude in the use of property, while at the same time requiring design
solutions which will avoid detrimental impacts on sensitive natural areas, as
well as provide protection from adverse natural forces and hazards. (Ord. 2008-
002, 2008)
18.24.020: PERMITTED USES:
The following uses are permitted in the SA district:
   Horticulture and gardening, excluding agricultural industries.
   Raising of crops.
   Tilling of the soil. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.24.030: CONDITIONAL USES:
The SA district is an overlay district whose sole effect is to require
additional review of proposed uses in the underlying districts. To this end,
any permitted use in a district overlaid by an SA district, with the exception
of those uses permitted in section
18.24.020 of this chapter, is a conditional use. Conditional uses authorized in
districts overlaid by the SA district remain conditional uses. (Ord. 2008-002,
2008)
18.24.040: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The sensitive area district, SA zoning district, if not marked on the zoning
map per se, shall nonetheless include areas of the city designated as:
   A.   100-year mapped floodplain according to the national flood insurance
program.
   B.   Geologic hazards, including earthquake areas/faults, unstable soil
conditions, subsidence, slopes in excess of twenty five percent (25%), rockfall
areas, cliffs, unstable slopes and areas subject to flooding.
   C.   Areas of high water table and ground water, including wetlands, high
water table, perched water, floodway, drainageways and swampy conditions.
   D.   Other environmentally sensitive areas. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)

18.26.050: Concept Plan Requirements
18.26.060: Revert To Original Zoning
18.26.010: PURPOSES:
   A.   To encourage and provide a means for effectuating desirable development
through the use of variations in sites, mixed land uses and/or varied dwelling
or other buildings.
   B.   To preserve the amenities and compatibility of PL districts by adoption
of a general development plan showing proper orientation, desirable design
character, and compatible land uses.
   C.   To provide for the orderly preplanning and long term development for a
variety of uses or large tracts of land which are under unified ownership or
development control, so as to ensure that the entire tract will provide an
environment of stable and desirable character.
   D.   To give the developer reasonable assurance that phased development
plans prepared in accordance with an approved general development plan will be
acceptable to the city.
   E.   Phased development plans shall include subdivision plans and/or planned
unit development plans as provided for in this chapter.
   F.   To enable the adoption of measures providing for development of the
surrounding area in character compatible with the planned district. (Ord. 2008-
002, 2008)
18.26.020: STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
The following provisions shall apply in a PL district, which district shall
also be subject to other provisions of this title, except that where conflict
in regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this chapter, or on a
development plan approved pursuant to this chapter, shall apply:
   A.   Location; Acreage: PL districts may be established on parcels of land
which are suitable for, and of sufficient size, to be planned and developed in
a manner consistent with the purposes and objectives of this chapter. No PL
district shall include less than five (5) acres of contiguous land.
   B.   Written Consent Of Property Owners: No ordinance establishing a PL
district shall be adopted unless and until there is on file with the city,
written consent of every property owner within such district at the time of
adoption of the ordinance, agreeing:
      1.   That the owner will be bound by the conditions and regulations
proposed and which will be effective within the PL district.
      2.   To record such written agreement with the Carbon County recorder.
   C.   Written Request For Studies: Before detailed studies of any PL district
development plans shall be undertaken by the planning staff or the planning
commission, there shall be on file with the city the written request of all
property owners within the proposed district that such detailed studies be
made.
   D.   Standards: Standards for area, coverage, density, yard requirements,
parking and screening for PL district uses shall be governed by the standards
of the residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts most similar in
nature and function of the proposed PL district use(s), as determined by the
planning commission, and as contained in an approved preliminary design plan
for the planned unit development. Standards for public improvements shall be
governed by applicable ordinances, regulations and laws. Exceptions to or
modification of these standards may be made by the planning commission and by
the city council, when these bodies find that such exceptions encourage a
desirable living environment and are warranted in terms of the proposed planned
unit development as a whole. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.26.030: APPROVAL REQUIRED PRIOR TO REZONING:
Prior to the filing of a formal PL district rezoning application, the applicant
shall have obtained concept plan approval for the planned unit development from
the planning commission, which plans shall have been certified to the city
council. Upon receipt of the approved concept plan, the city council shall
proceed with the zoning district amendment procedures outlined in this title.
Such amendment procedures shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the meeting
of the planned unit development requirements (which must be met incident to
obtaining concept plan approval from the planning commission). (Ord. 2008-002,
2008)
18.26.040: FINDINGS REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL:
After public hearing following required legal notice, the city council may by
ordinance establish a PL district; provided, that it finds that the facts
submitted with the application and presented at the hearing establish:
   A.   The proposed PL district or a given unit thereof can be substantially
completed within two (2) years of the establishment of the PL district.
   B.   Each phase of the development, as well as the total development, can
exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of sustained
desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance will be provided that
such objective will be attained; and that the uses proposed will not be
detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which could not be achieved under other zoning districts.
   C.   The streets proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated
traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as
to overload the street network outside the PL district.
   D.   Commercial development can be justified economically at the locations
proposed, if any, to provide commercial facilities.
   E.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
   F.   Any exception from standard ordinance requirements is warranted by the
design and amenities incorporated into the final plan.
   G.   The PL district is in conformance with the general plan.
   H.   Existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the population
and use densities proposed. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.26.050: CONCEPT PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
At the time of adoption of any ordinance establishing a PL district, the city
council shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to ensure the
accomplishment, at the scheduled times, of the public improvements, public
dedications, and grants of easement to be shown on the approved concept plan.
The PL district shall be given an appropriate name, number or letter to
identify it, and the approved concept plan shall be adopted by reference and
become part of this title. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.26.060: REVERT TO ORIGINAL ZONING:
   A.   Failure To Develop Within Time Limit: If no development has occurred to
effectuate a PL district development within two (2) years after the district
has been created, the planning commission shall review the action and determine
whether or not the continuation of a given PL district is in the public
interest. If the planning commission so recommends, the city council may order
that the area revert to the original district from which it was created,
without a public hearing.
   B.   Land Sale: If the land within a PL district is sold to new owner(s),
the planning commission or the city council shall require the new owner(s) to
accept in writing all obligations and guarantees required by the preliminary
design plan of the original owner(s). In the event that such agreement is not
provided, the governing body may, without public hearing, return the zoning of
the PL district to the original zoning which existed prior to creation of the
PL districts.
   C.   Noncompliance With Approval: If the owner or developer of the PL
district is unwilling or unable to carry out the requirements of the
preliminary design plan because claimed adequate water supplies, wastewater
disposal, streets, or other major elements of approval cannot or will not be
provided as required, the city council may stop all development in the district
until such failure has been remedied or may terminate the PL district and
revert back to the original zoning which existed prior to creation of the PL
district, without waiting for the two (2) year period provided above to expire.

18.30.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this zone is to provide for flexible utilization of land in
redevelopment areas, as established by the city, where some of the established
land patterns and uses are nonconforming with respect to basic community
standards adopted in this title. When it is determined to be in the interests
of the community to foster appropriate utilization of existing facilities,
undersized lots, or redevelop blighted areas, a conditional use permit may be
used to reduce parking requirements and/or otherwise modify requirements for
uses that will be beneficial to the area and harmonious with the surroundings.
(Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.30.020: PERMITTED USES:
None. (Ord. 2008-002, 2008)
18.30.030: CONDITIONAL USES:
All uses located within the limits of the redevelopment overlay zone are
conditional uses and require issuance of a conditional use permit. (Ord. 2008-
002, 2008)
18.30.040: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Uses may be continued or changed.
   B.   Buildings may be altered to accommodate new uses.
   C.   Uses and buildings may be limited as to scope or length of time.
   D.   Every conditional use permit and each approval shall be based primarily
on how the development, as proposed in the application, will contribute to
economic activity, compatibility, mutual private and public benefit from
existing, proposed or potential buildings and uses in the area; the efficient,
effective, economic and aesthetic use of land, buildings, landscaping and
amenities; and the improvements to be made in land utilization, building
construction and appearance, traffic safety and control, landscaping and
drainage.
