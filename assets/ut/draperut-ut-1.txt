2-4-060: CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUES:
A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide advisory guidelines for
the city to assist the city in identifying actions that involve physical taking
or exaction of private real property that may have constitutional taking
issues. This section does not apply when the City formally exercises its power
of eminent domain.
B.   Definitions: As used herein:
1.   CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUES: Actions involving the physical taking or
exaction of private real property by the city that might require compensation
to a private real property owner under:
a.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United
States;
b.   Article I, section 22 of the Utah constitution; or
c.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical taking or exaction of
private real property by a governmental entity.
C.   Guidelines: The following guidelines shall be considered by the city when
taking any action that might result in the physical taking or exaction of
private real property:
1.   Identification: The city should review the following to determine and
identify whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking
issues:
a.   Does the action result in a permanent physical occupation of private
property?
b.   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an
easement to the city?
c.   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically viable uses
of the property?
d.   Does the action have a severe impact on the property owner's economic
interest?
e.   Does the action deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?
D.   Analysis: If the city determines that a governmental action involves
constitutional taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed by the
city to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken. In
reviewing the proposed action, the following factors may be analyzed:
1.   The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the
private property;
2.   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking;
3.   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the city's
lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;
4.   The cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined;
5.   The legitimate governmental interest involved and its essential nexus to
the potential taking or exaction; and
6.   If the action is roughly proportionate and reasonably related both in
nature and extent, to the impact caused by the activities that are the subject
of the proposed action.
E.   Appeals:
1.   Right to Appeal. Any owner of private property whose interest in the
property is subject to a physical taking or exaction by the City, pursuant to a
final and authoritative decision or action of the City, may appeal the City’s
decision or action.
2.   Filing Procedure. An application shall initiate the appeal by filing a
written notice of appeal and statement of all the grounds for the appeal in the
City Recorder’s Office within thirty (30) days from the date of the City’s
decision or action.
3.   Appeal Procedure and Timing. The Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer
shall hear all evidence regarding the appeal and render a decision and findings
in writing within fourteen (14) days from the date the appeal was filed. If the
Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer fails to hear and decide the appeal within
fourteen (14) days, the City’s decision or action is presumed to be approved.
4.   Standard of Review. The Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer shall review
the facts and information presented by the applicant and the City to determine
by a preponderance of the evidence whether or not the action by the City
constitutes a constitutional taking. In doing so, he or she shall consider the
criteria for an exaction under the Utah Code § 10-9a-508, as well as applicable
state and federal statutory and common law.
F.   Limitations: The guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and shall
not be construed to expand nor limit the scope of the city's liability for a
constitutional taking. The city shall have no legal liability to any person,
firm or entity of any nature whatsoever and a court may not impose liability
upon the city for failure to comply with the provisions of this section. The
private property owner need not file the appeal authorized by this section
before bringing an action in any court to adjudicate claims that are eligible
for appeal. A property owner's failure to appeal the action of the city does
not constitute, and may not be interpreted as constituting, a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies or as a bar to bringing legal action. (Ord.

3-3-150: DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS PERSONAL PROPERTY:
A.   Whenever City personal property is no longer needed by the department

this section shall be credited to the fund sundry account.
E.   Where City personal property is of such a size, shape, or is so unique as
to be unmarketable, the above requirements may be waived and such property may
be sold or otherwise disposed of in any reasonable manner, with the approval of
the City Council. (Ord. 1257, 5-2-2017)
3-3-160: DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS REAL PROPERTY:

greater than one (1) acre or that has a reasonable value in excess of one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00).

surplus. Surplus real property may include real property that is not needed for
City infrastructure, property where the cost to maintain the property outweigh
its value to the City, is part of a property trade that will benefit the City,
the sale of which will realize significant financial benefits to the City, or
the disposal of which is otherwise in the public interest.
B.   Before the City may dispose of a significant parcel of real property, the
City shall provide notice as required in subsection
3-3-090D of this chapter; and hold a public meeting at which the City Council
accepts public comment on the proposed disposition.
C.   All disposal, leases, or subleases of such real property of the City other
than a significant parcel of real property, shall be made, as nearly as
possible, under the same conditions and limitations as required by this chapter
for the purchase of property including notice and bidding procedures.
D.   The City Council may also authorize at its discretion and under such terms
and conditions as it may deem desirable, fair and appropriate, considering
intended use, property tax value and the interests of the City, the sale of any
surplus property, through public auction or other method designed to best serve
the interests of City residents and produce a fair return; the trade or
exchange or any surplus property; and the lease or sublease of any surplus
property. (Ord. 1257, 5-2-2017)
3-3-170: PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES:
A.   Manipulation Prohibited: Purchases shall not be manipulated or
artificially divided to fall within the exempt expenditure category, or to
avoid using standard purchasing methods and policies.

public record as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten (10)
business days after receiving the written request as described in this section.

the time for response to that time reasonably necessary to respond to the
request, as determined by the city. Extraordinary circumstances shall include,

research to locate the materials requested;
3.   The city is currently processing a large number of records requests;
4.   The decision to release a record involves legal issues that require the
city to seek legal counsel for the analysis of statutes, rules, ordinances,
regulations, or case law;
5.   Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from
information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires extensive
editing; or

programming.
E.   When a record request cannot be responded to within ten (10) days, the
city shall give the requester an estimate of the time required to respond to
the request.
F.   The failure or inability of the city to respond to a request for a record
within the time frames set out herein, or the city's denial of such request,
shall give the requester the right to appeal.
G.   Any record which has been requested that is disposable by the approved
retention schedule may not be disposed of until the request is granted and
fulfilled, or sixty (60) days after all appeals are completed.
H.   No record, disposable by the approved retention schedule, which is subject
to pending litigation or audit shall be disposed of until the litigation or
audit has been completed or resolved. (Ord. 1086, 3-4-2014)

administrative costs for complying with a request; and

other than word processing, the actual incremental cost of providing the
electronic services and products together with a reasonable portion of the
costs associated with formatting or interfacing the information for particular
users, and the administrative costs as set forth in Utah Code Annotated section
63G-2-203(2)(a)(k) and (ii).
C.   The City may fulfill a record request without charge when it determines
that:
1.   Releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person;
2.   The individual requesting the record is the subject of the record, or an
individual specified in Utah Code Annotated section 63G-2-202(1) or (2); or
3.   The requester's legal rights are directly implicated by the information in
the record, and the requester is impecunious.
D.   The City may not charge a fee for reviewing a record to determine whether
it is subject to disclosure or for inspecting a record. (Ord. 1086, 3-4-2014)
3-4-100: APPEALS:
A.   A requester or interested party may appeal an access denial to the City
Manager within thirty (30) days after the City sends a notice of denial. A
notice of appeal shall contain the name, mailing address, and daytime telephone
number of the requester or interested party; and the relief sought. The
requester or interested party may file a short statement of facts, reasons, and
legal authority in support of the appeal.
B.   If a City claims extraordinary circumstances and specifies the date when
the records will be available and, if the requester believes the extraordinary
circumstances do not exist or that the date specified is unreasonable, the
requester may appeal the City's claim of extraordinary circumstances or date
for compliance to the City Manager by filing a notice of appeal with the City
Manager within thirty (30) days after notification of a claim of extraordinary
circumstances by the City, despite the lack of a "determination" or its
equivalent.
C.   If the appeal involves a record that is the subject of a business
confidentiality claim, the City Manager shall:
1.   Send notice of the appeal to the business confidentiality claimant within
three (3) business days after receiving notice, except that if notice under
this section must be given to more than thirty five (35) persons, it shall be
given as soon as reasonably possible; and

City Manager's determination to the requester or interested party within three
(3) business days after receiving notice of the appeal.

after notice is sent by the City Manager to submit further support for the
claim of business confidentiality.

business days after receipt of the notice of appeal or twelve (12) business
days after the City sends the notice of appeal to a person who submitted a
claim of business confidentiality.
1.   If the City Manager fails to make a decision on an appeal of an access
denial within the time specified, the failure is the equivalent of a decision
affirming the access denial.
2.   If the City Manager fails to make a decision on an appeal within the time
specified, the failure is the equivalent of a decision affirming the claim of
extraordinary circumstances or the reasonableness of the date specified when
the records will be available.
3.   The provisions of this section notwithstanding, the parties participating
in the proceeding may, by agreement, extend the time periods specified in this
section.
E.   The City Manager may, upon consideration and weighing of the various
interests and public policies pertinent to the classification and disclosure or
nondisclosure, order the disclosure of information properly classified as
private or protected if the interests favoring access are greater than or equal
to the interests favoring restriction of access.
F.   The City shall send written notice of the City Manager's decision to all
participants. If the City Manager's decision is to affirm the access denial in

time of the meeting during which the removal will be considered. When a
historic property has been removed from the Historic Sites List, the commission
shall promptly notify the owner of the property in writing of the removal.
2.   By Owner: Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an owner
from removing his or her property from the Historic Sites List as the owner in
his or her sole discretion deems appropriate. Such request for removal shall be
made in writing by the owner to the commission. Requests for removal from the
Historic Sites List shall be determined by the commission. The owner of the
property shall be notified in writing of the date and time of the meeting
during which the removal will be considered by the commission. The commission
may not withhold approval of any removal request, but review and written
approval may be conducted by the city for informational and administrative
purposes. The city shall not accept any liability whatsoever for an owner's
decision to remove his or her property from the Historic Sites List.
3.   Notice Of Removal: When any property is removed from the Historic Sites
List, the commission shall file notice of the removal with the city and county
recorder's office, as applicable.
K.   Standards For Rehabilitation: The following "standards for rehabilitation"
shall be used by the commission when determining the historic appropriateness
of any building permit application on the Historic Sites List:
1.   Use: The property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
structure and its site and environment.
2.   Character: The historic character of the property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize the property shall be avoided.
3.   Developments: Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of
its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
4.   Changes: Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
5.   Distinctive Items: Distinctive features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the structure shall
be preserved.
6.   Deterioration: Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather
than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
7.   Cleaning: Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
8.   Resources: Significant archaeological resources affected by a project
shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed,
mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
9.   Materials: New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the historic property and its environment.
10.   Historic Integrity: New additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the
future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
11.   Additional Guidelines: Additional guidelines may be used as set forth in
"The Secretary Of The Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation And Guidelines
For Rehabilitating Historic Buildings".
L.   Enforcement: The provisions of this section are subject to the enforcement
provisions established in the uniform building code, uniform code for building
conservation, uniform housing code, zoning ordinances, and other ordinances, as
adopted and amended by the city. Failure to follow standards as required herein
may result in the removal of the property from the Historic Sites List.
M.   Appeals: Any adversely affected party as defined in section
9-3-040 wishing to appeal a final decision of the commission in the
administration of this section may appeal such decision to the city council by

promote and preserve the public health, safety and welfare.
C.   The city council hereby adopts the report from Tischler & Associates,

for providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the

Constructing public facilities which are not included in the capital
improvement plans shall be considered premature. Wherever a development
activity requires the installation of public facilities which are not included
in the capital improvement plans and it is determined by the city council that
the construction of such public facilities as will not lead to the practical
exclusion of constructing future public facilities as projected in the capital
facilities plan, such improvements may be authorized, but shall be constructed
by the developer solely at developer's cost without city financial
participation. (Ord. 296, 11-3-1998)
5-15-030: REIMBURSEMENT FOR OVERSIZING PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
Reimbursement for oversizing public facilities not included in the capital
improvement plan in order to avoid the practical exclusion of constructing
future system improvements included in the long term capital facilities plan:
A.   Authorization To Construct Oversized Improvements: The city council in its
sole discretion may determine it necessary for the city to participate in
oversizing of developers installed public facilities in areas otherwise
premature for service by city installed improvements in order to avoid the
practical exclusion of constructing planned city infrastructure in the future.
Where authorized and approved in writing by the city council, developers may
construct oversized public facilities for new developments within the city and
receive reimbursement for such construction. Responsibility to pay for the
construction of any such oversized public facilities shall rest entirely with
the developer pending any reimbursement. A reimbursement to avoid a practical
exclusion shall be paid from impact fees collected in anticipation of the
construction of future system improvements within the same service area.
B.   Facilities Eligible For Reimbursement: No public facilities shall be
eligible for oversizing reimbursement, unless specifically approved prior to
construction in writing by the city council. Project improvements shall not be
eligible for reimbursement.
1.   Calculation And Approval Of Amount Of Reimbursement: Developers seeking
reimbursement for oversizing of public facilities shall prior to commencing
construction submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications and
construction cost estimates to the city engineer in accordance with current
city standards. The city engineer shall recommend the maximum amount of
reimbursement for the proposed oversized portion of the improvements based on
either these cost estimates or on alternative engineering criteria and
construction cost estimates if the estimates submitted by the developer are
deemed by the city engineer to be either unreliable, inaccurate, or excessive.
Based on this review, the city council shall by resolution determine any amount
and method of reimbursement, taking into consideration the proportionate share
of the benefit of the improvements to the developer's project and to fulfilling
the capital facilities plan.
2.   Reimbursement Agreement: The city manager shall, prior to commencement of
construction of the oversized public facilities, provide the developer with a
letter or certificate setting forth the maximum dollar amount of reimbursement,
the rationale for the reimbursement, and the legal description or other
adequate description of the oversized public facility or facilities for which
reimbursement will be approved. The developer shall sign and date a duplicate
copy of such letter or certificate indicating developer's agreement to the
terms set forth and return the signed document to the city manager prior to any
reimbursement or credit being paid or granted. The failure of the developer to
sign, date, and return such document within thirty (30) days from receipt shall
nullify the reimbursement approval.
C.   Finding Of Sufficiency: Before approving any reimbursement for oversized
public facilities which are not included in the city's capital improvement
plan, the city council must find that the sufficient impact fees scheduled to
be received from previously approved development activities within the same
service area are available to pay the portion of the expense of capital outlay
or debt service to be paid from impact fees as shown in the city's capital
improvement plan.
D.   Appeals Of Reimbursement Amount: Where extraordinary, unanticipated costs
are incurred in the actual construction of the oversized portion of the public
facilities, the developer may appeal the reimbursement amount to the city
council.
E.   Limits On Reimbursement: Notwithstanding anything contained in this
chapter to the contrary, reimbursements shall not be made by the city for
exactions required by the city as a condition of development approval or for
public facilities provided voluntarily by the developer or provided in exchange
for other negotiated considerations granted to the development by the city,
unless approved in writing in advance by the city. No interest shall be paid on
any reimbursement amount. The reimbursement agreement shall not confer benefit
on any third party, except as security for financing as required by the
developer.
F.   Expiration Of Reimbursement Agreement: The reimbursement agreement for
oversized public facilities shall expire ten (10) years from the date of its
execution by the developer unless a longer period is approved in writing in
advance by the city council or is extended by the city upon request by the
developer. Any extended reimbursement period shall be specified in the
reimbursement agreement and subject to a finding by city council that
sufficient impact fees scheduled to be received from previously approved
development activities within the same service area are available to pay the
portion of the expense of capital outlay or debt service to be paid from impact
fees as shown in the city's capital improvement plan.
G.   Acceptance Of Improvements: No reimbursement shall be made or granted
unless:
1.   Construction of oversized public facilities is completed to the
satisfaction of the city, and the facilities are formally accepted by the city;
2.   Suitable maintenance and warranty security is received and approved by the
city engineer;
3.   All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and acceptance
procedures are in strict compliance with the then current city street,
drainage, or other applicable ordinances and standards.
H.   Proportional Distribution Of Impact Fees Received: Wherever an oversizing
reimbursement is due, impact fees collected within the applicable service area
shall be utilized first as required to implement the capital improvement plan,
then divided among outstanding systems improvement reimbursement agreements in
proportion to the amounts due, and the balance divided among outstanding
oversizing reimbursement agreements in proportion to the amounts due.
I.   Schedule Of Reimbursements: When the city council authorizes reimbursement
for oversizing, it will schedule the reimbursement as follows: If the total
amount of the reimbursement is less than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00), the city will issue a onetime lump sum payment, providing
adequate impact fees are available, after all oversized public facilities
giving rise to the reimbursement have been given final acceptance by the city.
If the total amount of the reimbursement is more than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00), the city will make semiannual payments based on the
percentage completion of the oversized improvements giving rise to the
reimbursement, with each payment being made only after review and approval of
appropriate documentation of the construction. Any such semiannual payments
shall be made only upon certification by the city manager that applicable
impact fees have been collected in the previous semiannual period in excess of
the amounts required in subsection C of this section. Impact fees from one type
of improvement may not be utilized to provide a reimbursement to a developer
for another type of improvement. (Ord. 296, 11-3-1998)
5-15-040: CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE
CITY'S CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN:
A.   Authorization To Construct Systems Improvements: Where authorized and
approved by the city council pursuant to this chapter, developers may construct
system improvements which are included in the capital improvement plan and
receive credit against related impact fees and reimbursement for such
construction. Responsibility to pay for the construction of any such system
improvements shall rest entirely with the developer.
B.   Only System Improvements Are Eligible For Credits And Reimbursement: Only
system improvements are eligible for credits and reimbursements. Project
improvements shall not be eligible for credits or reimbursements.
C.   Calculation And Approval Of Amount Of Credits And Reimbursement:
Developers seeking credits for system improvements shall, prior to commencing
construction, submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications and
construction cost estimates to the city engineer in accordance with current
city standards. The city engineer shall recommend the maximum amount of credits
and reimbursement for the proposed system improvements based on either these
cost estimates or on alternative engineering criteria and construction cost
estimates if the estimates submitted by the developer are deemed by the city
engineer to be either unreliable, inaccurate, or excessive. Based on this
review, the city council shall by resolution determine the amount of credits
due, taking into consideration the proportionate share of the benefit of the
improvements to the developer's project and to fulfilling the capital
facilities plans. The balance of the construction cost of the system
improvement as approved by the city engineer shall be reimbursed from impact
fees collected for the same purpose in the same service area over the ten (10)
year period following acceptance by the city acceptance of the completed system
improvements.
D.   Credit/Reimbursement Agreement: Based on this review and determination,
the city manager shall, prior to commencement of construction of the system
improvements, provide the developer with a letter of certificate setting forth
the maximum dollar amount of credit and reimbursement, the rationale for the
credit and reimbursement, and the legal description or other adequate
description of the system improvements for which credits and reimbursement will
be approved. The developer shall sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter
or certificate indicating developer's agreement to the terms set forth and
return the signed document to the city manager prior to any credit and
reimbursement being paid or granted. The failure of the developer to sign,
date, and return such document within thirty (30) days from receipt shall
nullify the credit and reimbursement approval.
E.   Acceptance Of Improvements And Granting Of Credit And Reimbursement:
Credit and reimbursement shall not be granted or made unless:
1.   Construction of the system improvement public facilities is completed to
the satisfaction of the city, and the facilities are formally accepted by the
city;
2.   Suitable maintenance and warranty surety is received and approved by the
city engineer;
3.   All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and acceptance
procedures are in strict compliance with the then current city street,
drainage, or other applicable ordinances and standards.
F.   Appeals Of Credit/Reimbursement Amount: Where extraordinary, unanticipated
costs are incurred in the actual construction of the system improvements, the
developer may appeal the credit and reimbursement amount to the city council.
Approved credits may be used only to reduce the amount of impact fees from the
developer for the same type of improvement. Except as provided below, approved
credits shall not be paid to the developer in cash or in credits against any
impact fee for a different type of improvement or against any other monies due
from the developer to the city and shall not constitute a liability of the city
except as set forth herein. Each time a request to use approved credits is
presented and approved by the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the
applicable impact fee otherwise due from the developer and shall note in the
city records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the
developer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credits
available.
G.   Limits On Credits/Reimbursements: Notwithstanding anything contained in
this chapter to the contrary, credits and reimbursement shall not be granted by
the city for exactions required by the city as a condition of development
approval or for system improvements provided voluntarily by the developer or
provided in exchange for other negotiated considerations granted to the
development by the city, unless approved in advance in writing by the city. No
interest shall be paid on any credit or reimbursement. The credit and
reimbursement agreement shall not confer benefit on any third party, except as
security for financing as required by the developer.
H.   Expiration Of Credit/Reimbursement Agreement: The credit/reimbursement
agreement shall expire ten (10) years from the date of its execution by the
developer unless a longer period is approved in writing in advance by the city
council or is extended by the city council upon written request by the
developer. Any extended credit/reimbursement period shall be specified in the
credit/reimbursement agreement.
I.   Proportional Distribution Of Impact Fees Received: Wherever a system
improvement reimbursement is due, impact fees collected within the applicable
service area shall be utilized first as required to implement the capital
improvement plan, and then divided among outstanding system improvement
reimbursement agreements in proportion to the amounts due. Reimbursements for
system improvements may be made only from impact fees paid for the same type of
improvement.
J.   Schedule Of Reimbursements: When the city council authorizes
reimbursement, it will schedule the reimbursement as follows: If the total
amount of the reimbursement is less than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00), the city will issue a onetime lump sum payment, providing
adequate impact fees are available, after all system improvements giving rise
to the reimbursement have been given final acceptance by the city. If the total
amount of the reimbursement is more than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00), the city will make semiannual payments based on the percentage
completion of the system improvements giving rise to the reimbursement, with
each payment being made only after review and approval of appropriate
documentation of the construction. Any such semiannual payments shall be made
only upon certification by the city manager that applicable impact fees for the
same type of improvement have been collected in the previous semiannual period
in excess of the amounts required to fund the capital improvement plan. (Ord.
296, 11-3-1998)

agency of "A" or higher;
B.   Private entities must have a bond rating from a national rating agency of
investment grade or higher or must provide credit enhancement in the form of a

city. Any LOC guarantee must be issued by a bank authorized to do business in
the state of Utah with a rating of no less than "A". Bond insurance shall be by
a national insurer acceptable to the city.

charged, the council shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of

businesses of like nature. (Ord. 590, 2-15-2005)

The provisions codified in this chapter shall be known and may be referred to
as the SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEE LICENSING ORDINANCE. (Ord. 565,
3-9-2004)
6-5-020: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene materials.
B.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available
to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City Of Los
Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); City Of Erie v. Pap's
A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991);
City Of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud
Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986); Iacobucci v. City Of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92
(1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v.
LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS,
Inc. v. City Of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap
County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City Of Arlington, 65
F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City Of Miami,
734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. City Of Houston, 27
F.Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex.1998), as well as studies conducted in other cities,
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove,
California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont,
Texas; and findings reported in the final report of the attorney general's
commission on pornography (1986), the report of the attorney general's working
group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses (June 6, 1989, state of
Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. department of health and
human services, centers for disease control and prevention, the city council
finds that:
1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
2.   Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex related
crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented
businesses are located.
3.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
4.   Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
5.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually
oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of
such sexually oriented businesses.
6.   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections.
7.   As of June, 2001, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United
States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 793,025.
8.   The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in
the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a six percent (6%) increase
over the year 1999.
9.   The total number of cases of early (less than 1 year) syphilis in the
United States reported during the twelve (12) year period 1996-2000 was
212,672.
10.   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually
remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases reported during the
period 1996-2000.
11.   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22,
1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected
blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
12.   According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
13.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy,
in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part,
because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the
owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and
maintain those facilities.
14.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids,
including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented
businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
15.   Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases
sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity.
16.   Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug
dealing and drug use.
17.   Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of
crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages
undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety,
and welfare.
18.   The findings noted in subsections B1 through B17 of this section raise
substantial governmental concerns.
19.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
20.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the
burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually
oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore
nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate
to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein.
21.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult
establishments.
22.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
23.   It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of
communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to
prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
24.   The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has
been convicted of a sex related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter.
25.   The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually
oriented businesses for a period of five (5) years for a previous felony
conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
26.   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this
city will be promoted by enactment of this chapter.
27.   When more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the same
location or business address, the secondary effects caused by such businesses
are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a greater

7-2-080: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
A.   Generally: No person shall discharge into the sewer system any substance
which, under ordinary circumstances, either is harmful or detrimental to or
interferes with either the sewer system, the functioning of the sewer system,
the environment, or the public health, or which causes sewage to pass through
the sewer system without treatment, thereby creating a significant health
hazard or diminishing the quality of the environment.
B.   Violating Pretreatment Rules And Regulations: No person shall discharge
into the sewer system any substance which violates the wastewater discharge
prohibitions and limitations contained within chapter 2, section 2.2 of the
SVSD's pretreatment rules and regulations, as amended, which are incorporated
by this reference as a part hereof as though fully set forth herein, together
with any schedules or appendices which are a part of chapter 2, section 2.2 of
the SVSD's pretreatment rules and regulations.
C.   Discharge Of Substances In Excess Of TSSD Local Limits: No person shall
discharge into the sewer system in service area 3 any substance listed in
section
7-2-130, appendix B of this chapter in excess of the quantities or
concentrations listed therein. Section
7-2-130, appendix B of this chapter is hereby adopted as part of this code.
Discharge of a substance prohibited by one section of section
7-2-130, appendix B of this chapter shall be a separate violation in addition
to discharge of the same or similar substance prohibited by another section of
section
7-2-130, appendix B of this chapter. (Ord. 1167, 11-10-2015; amd. Ord. 1473, 1-
19-2021)
7-2-090: REPORTING:
A.   Immediate Notification Of Prohibited Discharge: Any person who discharges
a prohibited substance or discovers that a prohibited substance has been
discharged shall immediately notify the SVSD by the most rapid available means,
if such person knows or reasonably should have known that the substance was
discharged and the discharge of the substance was prohibited. Notification
pursuant to this subsection does not relieve the person notifying of any
liability, except liability for violation of this subsection.
B.   Report: Within five (5) days after the discharge of a prohibited
substance, the person who discharged such substance shall file with the SVSD a
written report describing the nature and content of the discharge, the cause of
the discharge, and remedial measures to be taken by the discharger to prevent
similar discharges in the future. The SVSD may inspect the site of the
discharge and interview any person involved to ascertain or confirm what
happened and assure that remedial measures adequate to prevent future accidents
are carried out as represented. (Ord. 1167, 11-10-2015)
7-2-100: PREVENTION OF PROHIBITED DISCHARGES:
A.   Generally: Every person conducting an activity which creates a substantial
risk that a prohibited substance will be discharged into the sewer system shall
provide adequate protection against accidental discharge of such a prohibited
substance by either implementing procedures or practices which tend to reduce
the likelihood of such a discharge or installing facilities designed to prevent
such accidental discharge. The SVSD may identify persons required to provide
such protection and direct them to comply with this subsection.
B.   Particular Procedures And Facilities: The SVSD may specify particular
procedures, practices, and facilities which shall be implemented by any person
if the SVSD finds there is substantial risk of a prohibited discharge if
preventive measures are not undertaken, that such procedures, practices and
facilities substantially reduce the risk of discharge prohibited by this
section, and that the cost of implementing such procedures, practices, and
installing such facilities is reasonable in light of both the potential damage
to the sewer system or the environment if an accidental discharge occurs and
the effectiveness of the equipment in preventing such an accidental discharge.
C.   Plans: In every case where facilities are required to be installed
pursuant to this section, the SVSD may require submission of detailed plans for
the required facilities and their operation before construction of the
facilities is begun.
D.   SVSD May Require Changes: If a person has discharged a prohibited
substance and it is likely that the same person will again discharge a similar
prohibited substance if preventive measures are not undertaken, the SVSD may
require the person who discharged the prohibited substance to make changes in
equipment, facilities, procedures, or practices, which changes have the effect
of substantially reducing the risk of a similar discharge in the future and are
found by the SVSD to be reasonable in cost in light of the potential damage to
the system and environment arising out of a similar prohibited discharge in the
future. Nothing in this subsection relieves any person of any liability, except
liability for violation of this subsection.
E.   Self-Monitoring And Reporting: The SVSD may require that persons that
generate and/or discharge wastewater into the sewer system, other than persons
generating and discharging only ordinary domestic sewage, monitor and report
their sewage discharges in a manner and to the extent necessary to provide
adequate compliance with and enforcement of the SVSD's pretreatment rules and
regulations, assess the source of the components of the sewage transmitted,
treated, and disposed of by the SVSD, and charge reasonable fees and surcharges
to dischargers based on actual damages or reasonable classifications of
discharges. The SVSD may also require that such monitoring and reporting be
performed at the expense of the person discharging. Every person required to
monitor and report shall do so as required by the SVSD's pretreatment rules and
regulations and in conformity with this section.
F.   Compliance Monitoring: The SVSD may sample and analyze the sewage of, and
inspect the facilities of person discharging into the sewer system to determine
or verify compliance with this section. The SVSD may also require the
installation of reasonable facilities, such as manholes, to enable such
sampling. However, nothing in this subsection limits any power that the SVSD
may have to investigate or enforce compliance with other sections of this code
or through means not specified in this subsection. (Ord. 1167, 11-10-2015)
7-2-110: EFFECT OF AMENDMENT:
Any amendment or repeal effected by adoption of this chapter or any section
thereof shall not affect any right which has accrued, any duty imposed, any
penalty incurred, nor any action or proceeding commenced under or by virtue of
the section amended or repealed, nor shall any repeal of any section have the
effect of reviving any section heretofore repealed or superseded. (Ord. 1167,

commencement of a civil action for any appropriate relief, including a
permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation or threatened violation of
its pretreatment rules and regulations or any of the provisions contained
within Utah Code Annotated title 19, chapter 5, as amended, which are by this
reference deemed implemented as a part hereof by the city pursuant to Utah Code
Annotated section 19-5-115(7), 1953, as amended.
C.   Strict Liability: Any person who violates any provision of this chapter
shall be guilty without regard to fault, knowledge, intent, or the state of
mind of the person committing the violation.

chapter is hereby declared to be public nuisance and may be abated as provided

7-9-110: Appeal
7-9-010: FINDINGS:
The city council of Draper City hereby finds and determines that the health,
safety, welfare, and convenience of the citizens of Draper City, requires the
operation of a secondary water system within the city at economical rates for
the purpose of providing outside watering and irrigation for properties located
within the boundaries of Draper City. The demand for culinary water to serve
the growing population and business demands within Draper City is steadily
increasing and current sources of culinary water will not be able to meet the
requirements from such growth over time, resulting in increased expenses and
costs for water for the general population. As water treatment costs increase
and water sources become more scarce, the cost of culinary water will increase.
As the city expands, current culinary water sources will become more stressed
and limited during peak periods of use. The city intends to acquire, operate,
and maintain a culinary water distribution system throughout the city and the
ability of the city to accomplish this will be negatively impacted if savings
cannot be obtained through use of secondary water for outside watering instead
of treated water. Usage of secondary water will, over time, enable the culinary
water distribution system planned by the city to meet expected demands for
extended periods of time and before system replacement will be necessary. The
city council further finds that utilizing treated culinary water for outside
watering and irrigation purposes is not economical. A piped, pressurized
secondary water system will inure to the benefit of the citizens of Draper City
by reducing water loss through seepage, reducing disturbance to property by
reason of loss through seepage, reducing disturbance to property by reason of
flooding, promoting the welfare and safety of the residents of the city,
including children by eventually eliminating open irrigation ditches which will
also conserve water resources and enhance the beauty of the city. At the
present time, the Draper Irrigation Company owns and operates a secondary water
system within the city. The city reserves the right to hereafter acquire and/or
operate a secondary system within the city. The city council further finds that
it is reasonable and desirable that new subdivisions constructed in Draper City
be required to install secondary water system facilities within the boundaries
of the subdivision in order to ensure that future secondary water service will
be available to the residents of such subdivision. (1994 Code)

the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation, and
maintenance in the rights of way.
B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the right to occupy
portions of the rights of way for limited times for the business of providing
telecommunications services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that
has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the city and its
taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
D.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city finds
that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the
rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis,
responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for
municipal, educational and community services.
E.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards:
1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which
providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
3.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may
flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
4.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of the
city in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the
city infrastructure;
6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of way; and
(Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
7.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are
created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") (Public Law 96-104).
(Ord. 403, 11-7-2000)
F.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts this telecommunications

applicable. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

8-1-050: NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE:
The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing
the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of systems in
the city's rights of way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
(Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-070: NATURE OF GRANT:

franchise is only the right to occupy rights of way on a nonexclusive basis for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the
right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased except as may be expressly
provided in a franchise agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its system on the property of others, including the city's property. This
section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to
another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 403,

during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if
negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply
with the provisions of section
8-1-460 of this chapter. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-090: NATURE OF FRANCHISE:

upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, five

fee shall also be paid when an amendment to an application is filed with the
city.

franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license tax or
fee enacted by the city.
C.   Encroachment Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
encroachment permit as provided in the city's encroachment permit ordinance.

be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of the close of each
calendar month. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be
accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated
and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-150: FUTURE COSTS:
A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at the direction of the

renegotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of this chapter, or a
franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable

payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any
other fees payable pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-170: INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS:
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before
the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from
such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes. (Ord.
247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-180: NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION:
No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for
additional sums payable. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-190: NOT IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES OR FEES:
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment
except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable
law. By way of example, and not limitation, encroachment permit fees are not
waived and remain applicable. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997; amd. Ord. 1538, 4-19-2022)
8-1-200: CONTINUING OBLIGATION AND HOLDOVER:

after the term of the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without
limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period
of such continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall
in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as
a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

format, they shall be made in electronic format compatible with the city's
existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the types
of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights of way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights of

B.   Throughout the term, a provider shall maintain complete and accurate books
of account and records of the business, ownership, and operations of a provider
with respect to the system in a manner that allows the city at all times to
determine whether a provider is in compliance with the franchise. Should the
city reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such a
manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the books and/or records are
maintained so that a provider comes into compliance with this section. All
financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with the
regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that regulates utilities in
the state of Utah, and generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed
to be acceptable under this section. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

and records. The provider agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable costs of
an audit if the audit discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent
(95%) or less of the compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In
the event the accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found
to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within
thirty (30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city may
accept any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the
city shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute
or is later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-430: ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES:

way without complying with the requirements of this chapter or franchise; or 3)
the provisions of section
8-1-090 of this chapter are applicable and no franchise is granted, a provider,
except the provider who is an incumbent local exchange carrier, shall be deemed
to have abandoned such system.
B.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The city, upon such terms as it may impose,
may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing, any
system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained under
a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the abandoned
system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any affected
rights of way to their former state at the time such system was installed, so
as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good condition
as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with
any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments.
The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the
rights of way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal.
The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and any
security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full force and effect

for by this chapter, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer,
the city shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its expense,
all above ground portions of a system from the rights of way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
E.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in place
so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights of way
or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other person.

of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or
state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in any way in order to
conform to the requirements of any such law and all appellate remedies with
regard to the validity of the ordinance provisions in question are exhausted,
such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part
of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is
subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the
provision which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with
such law the provision in question shall return to full force and effect and
shall again be binding on the city and the provider; provided, that the city
shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time as may be
reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a rejuvenated provision,
and written notice of the change before requiring compliance with such
provision. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-500: NEW DEVELOPMENTS:
It shall be the policy of the city to liberally amend this chapter, upon
application of a provider, when necessary to enable the provider to take
advantage of any developments in the field of telecommunications which will
afford the provider an opportunity to more effectively, efficiently, or
economically serve itself or the public. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)
8-1-510: NOTICES:
All notices from a provider to the city required under this chapter or pursuant
to a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be directed to the

application for a franchise the identity, address and phone number to receive
notices from the city. A provider shall immediately notify the city of any
change in its name, address, or telephone number. (Ord. 247, 9-2-1997)

services, without a franchise, prior to the effective date hereof. (Ord. 247,
9-2-1997)
8-1-550: OTHER APPLICABLE ORDINANCES:

comply with the city zoning and other land use requirements. (Ord. 247, 9-2-
1997)
8-1-560: CITY FAILURE TO ENFORCE:
A provider shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter or any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter by

or portions thereof provided by the home service provider to the city under a
claim that such documents are confidential business records are hereby
designated as "protected records" and shall not be copied or disclosed by the
city to third parties without the written permission of the home service
provider, unless such documents are determined by a court of law to constitute
"public records" within the meaning of the Utah government records access and
management act.
D.   Requirement To Maintain Electronic Database Or Enhanced Zip Code Listing:
1.   Electronic Database:
a.   Provision Of Database: The state may provide an electronic database to a
home service provider; or, if the state does not provide such an electronic
database, the designated database provider may choose to provide an electronic
database to a home service provider.
b.   Format:
(1)   Such electronic database, whether provided by the state or the designated
database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the American
National Standards Institute's accredited standards committee X12, which,
allowing for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address in the
city, including, to the extent practicable, any multiple postal street
addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing
jurisdictions, and the appropriate code identified by one nationwide standard
numeric code.
(2)   Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each
street address with respect to political subdivisions that are not taxing
jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing
jurisdiction.
(3)   The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of
numeric digits, with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same
level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States, using a format
similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation
Of Tax Administrators and the multistate tax commission or their successors.
Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.
2.   Notice; Updates: The state or designated database provider that provides
or maintains an electronic database described above shall provide notice of the
availability of the then current electronic database and any subsequent
revisions thereof, by publication in the manner normally employed for the
publication of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers in such
state.
3.   User Held Harmless: A home service provider using the data contained in an
electronic database described above shall be held harmless from any tax,
charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any
error or omission in such database provided by the city or designated database
provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such database
during a calendar quarter, not later than thirty (30) days after the end of
such calendar quarter the state has issued notice of the availability of an
electronic database reflecting such changes under subsection D2, "Notice;
Updates", of this section.
4.   Procedure If No Electronic Database Provided:
a.   Safe Harbor: If neither the state nor the designated database provider
provides an electronic database, a home service provider shall be held harmless
from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the city that otherwise would be due
solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing
jurisdiction, if the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to
assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction and exercises due
diligence to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct
taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing
jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one
specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the
activity for such enhanced zip code. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed
is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For purposes of this section,
there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised
due diligence if the home service provider demonstrates that it has:
(1)   Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately
detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing
jurisdictions;
(2)   Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly
correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and
(3)   Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal
annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in
jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.
b.   Termination Of Safe Harbor: Subsection D4a, "Safe Harbor", of this section
applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements
of subsection D4a, "Safe Harbor", of this section with respect to a state for
which an electronic database is not provided, until the later of:
(1)   Eighteen (18) months after the nationwide standard numeric code has been
approved by the Federation Of Tax Administrators and the multistate tax
commission; or
(2)   Six (6) months after the state or a designated database provider in the
state provides such database.
E.   Place Of Primary Use:
1.   A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the
customer's place of primary use. Subject to subsection D, "Requirement To
Maintain Electronic Database Or Enhanced Zip Code Listing", of this section,
and if the home service provider's reliance on information by its customer is
in good faith, a home service provider:
a.   May rely upon the applicable residential or business street address
supplied by the home service provider's customer.
b.   Is not liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a
different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees
that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate address under
existing agreements.
2.   A home service provider may treat the address used by the home service
provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or
agreement in effect two (2) years after the date of this amendment to this
chapter as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such
service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such
service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing
jurisdiction to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile
telecommunication services are remitted.
F.   Tax Against Customer: Each customer shall accurately report the customer's
place of primary use. The customer shall be liable for any taxes not paid by
the home service provider as a result of the customer's failure to accurately
report the customer's place of primary use.
G.   Nonapplication: This chapter does not apply to the determination of the
taxing status of:
1.   Prepaid telephone calling services; or
2.   Air-ground radio-telephone service, as defined in section 22.99 of title
47 of the code of federal regulations as in effect on June 1, 1999.
H.   Implementation Date: If this chapter is adopted before January 1, 2001, a
home service provider shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice before
being obligated to collect the tax described in this chapter. After January 1,
2001, a home service provider shall have a minimum of sixty (60) days' notice
before being obligated to collect the tax described in this chapter. After
January 1, 2001, a home service provider shall receive a minimum of sixty (60)
days' notice regarding any changes to this chapter.
I.   Monthly Tax Severability Clause: If subsection B, "Monthly Tax Levied", of
this section is for any reason determined to be, or is rendered, illegal,
invalid or superseded by other lawful authority, including any state or
federal, legislative, regulatory or administrative authority having
jurisdiction thereof, or determined to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
by any court of competent jurisdiction, such section shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision, and such determination shall have
no effect on the validity of any other section; provided, however, upon such
event and in lieu of such tax, there is levied upon every home service provider
a tax equal to six percent (6%) of the annual gross revenue of the home service
provider generated from services and products to its customers. (Ord. 407, 11-
7-2000)

8-3-030: ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY:
A.   Specified: The city manager or his or her designee shall execute and
enforce the provisions of this chapter and all other plans, standards, and
specifications for the regulation of matters pertaining to trees that may be
officially adopted by the city council. All problems related to and requests
for action on trees and shrubs on any city property shall be referred to the
public works department. The public works department is hereby authorized to
conduct such maintenance programs on trees and shrubs on city property as it
may deem appropriate.
B.   Determination Of Obstruction:
1.   When it is determined that a tree or shrub located on private property
overhangs or projects into any way or area and appears to be dead or liable to
fall into such city property or constitutes an obstruction to vision or travel
on any city sidewalk, property or street, the city is authorized to remove the
offending trees or branches or shrubs and to assess the actual costs against
the property owner. However, except in case of manifest public danger and
immediate necessity, no such trees or shrubs standing on any private property
shall be cut down or removed unless ten (10) days' notice shall be given to the
owner or occupant of said property. If the owner or occupant of such property
shall, within seven (7) days after receiving such notice, file with the city
recorder his objections, in writing, to such removal, such tree or shrub shall
not be cut down or removed unless the tree commission shall give such owner or
occupant a reasonable opportunity to be heard in support of such objection and
shall thereafter approve in writing the removal of the same, if the objection
is not sustained.
2.   Where an emergency exists with regards to a tree, the public works
department shall take such prompt and immediate action as is reasonably
necessary to remedy the emergency condition. An emergency condition is such
that renders life or property in immediate jeopardy.
3.   The public works department is hereby given authority to trim or prune or
to remove any tree or shrub which has been planted or is maintained, on or
within public property, in violation of any city ordinance, without serving
notice upon the owner of the abutting property. (Ord. 305, 2-16-1999)

A.   Permit Required; Fee: Other than for minor maintenance, it shall be
unlawful to plant, move, spray, trim, prune, cut above or below ground, disturb
or alter any tree or shrub on public property or to cause such acts to be done
by others without first obtaining a permit from the city. The city may issue
such permits if, in its judgment, the work is necessary and if the proposed
methods of workmanship are satisfactory. A permit fee may be established by
resolution. The person receiving the permit shall abide by the specifications
and standards of practice adopted by the city and/or the specific conditions or
methods listed on the permit.
B.   Replacement Tree Or Shrub Required: As a condition to any permit to remove
any public tree or shrub, the city shall require that the permittee plant one
or more trees or shrubs per city standards in place of the one removed, so that
the equivalent total caliper inch diameter is replaced or exceeded. The
provisions of this subsection shall apply to all public agencies, including
Draper City, to the extent allowed by applicable law, as well as to private
parties. Whenever such tree or shrub has been removed or destroyed pursuant to
any such conditional permit, it shall be a misdemeanor for the permittee to
fail, refuse or neglect to plant another tree(s) or shrub(s) of the type, size
and at the location specified in the permit within the time specified in the
permit. (Ord. 305, 2-16-1999)

8-4-010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare
and to enhance, preserve and protect existing aesthetics, property values and
quality of life within the city. It is the intent of this chapter to establish
an enterprise fund for the purpose of financing the conversion of existing
overhead utility facilities to underground facilities in logical segments and
in a manner which equitably allocates the burden of such. (Ord. 340, 11-16-
1999)
8-4-020: ENTERPRISE FUND ESTABLISHED:
The city council hereby establishes an overhead facilities conversion
enterprise fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial transactions
related to the conversion of overhead utility facilities to underground
facilities. All conversion fees collected shall be deposited in the conversion
enterprise fund. Monies in the conversion enterprise fund shall not be
commingled with or transferred to other city funds. However, the conversion
enterprise fund may pay other city funds for services and expenses directly
attributable to the conversion activity. The conversion enterprise fund shall
be operated according to state law and city ordinances, rules, regulations and
policies. (Ord. 340, 11-16-1999)

utility facilities shall be charged an overhead facilities conversion fee in
accordance with the provisions of section
8-2-050 of this title. The fee shall be based on the frontage of the property,
measured in feet, and shall assess a portion of the cost of converting the
facilities, which portion shall be determined by the city council and shall
represent an equitable allocation of the burden of conversion among all
obtaining substantial benefits therefrom. For minor subdivisions, as defined in
the Draper City subdivision ordinance, the fee shall be based on the width of
the street, private lane or right of way, which is the outlet from the
developed parcel to the existing public street providing access to the
development. (Ord. 426, 4-17-2001)

8-5-010: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
A.   Findings Regarding Rights-Of-Way: The City finds that the public rights-
of-way within the City:
1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the
business and social life of the City;
2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent
with that intent;
3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of wireless service providers,
to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of
the City and its citizens;
4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management
to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the
foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon
the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation, and
maintenance in the rights-of-way.
B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The City finds that the right to occupy
portions of the public rights-of-way for the business of providing wireless
services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired
and is maintained at great expense to the City and its taxpayers, and,
therefore, the taxpayers of the City should receive fair and reasonable
compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The City finds that while wireless
facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations
also involve public rights-of-way, Municipal zoning, and vital business and
community service, which are of local concern. The City also finds that it has
the proprietary right to determine what persons and entities are granted
permission to use City rights-of-way, and to determine the reasonable and
nondiscriminatory terms and conditions of such use.
D.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Wireless Services: The City finds that it
is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the
development of wireless services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to
community and public interest, and to assure availability for Municipal,
educational and community services.
E.   Findings Regarding Minimization Of Impacts: The City finds that towers and
other supporting structures present aesthetic and land use concerns that should
be dealt with by encouraging collocation, and minimizing the number of
structures in a manner that does not discourage market access or competition.
F.   Findings Regarding Master License Agreement Standards: The City finds
entering a Master License Agreement with providers:
1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which
providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
3.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may
flow from such commercial use of its public rights-of- way;
4.   Protects the police powers and proprietary authority of the City with
respect to its rights-of-way, in a manner consistent with Federal and State
law;
5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the
City infrastructure; and
6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the public rights-of-
way. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-020: PURPOSE AND GOALS:
A.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish requirements for the siting
and use of wireless facilities in City-owned rights- of-way in a manner that
facilitates the delivery of wireless services within the City, while minimizing
associated adverse impacts. The goals of this chapter are to:
1.   Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance,
modification, and removal of wireless services infrastructure in the City to
provide adequate wireless communications coverage, without unreasonably
discriminating against providers of functionally equivalent services including
all of those who install, maintain, and operate wireless facilities.
2.   Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and
specifically, protecting aesthetic values, by reducing the visibility of
wireless facilities and structures to the fullest extent possible through
techniques including but not limited to camouflage/concealment, design
techniques, and undergrounding of wireless facilities and the equipment
associated therewith, where possible.
3.   Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive wireless facilities to
supplement existing telecommunications facilities.
4.   Encourage the location of structures in a manner that is least intrusive
to the community.
5.   Encourage owners and users of antennas and structures to locate them, to
the extent possible, where the adverse impact on the community is minimized.
6.   Enhance the ability of providers to provide such wireless services to the
community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
7.   Effectively manage wireless facilities in the public right-of- way. (Ord.
1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-030: SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY:
A.   This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of
wireless services and systems that require the use of City-owned rights-of-way,
including providers of both the system and service, and those providers of the
system only.
B.   The requirements set forth in this chapter shall apply to all wireless
facilities and structures located within City-owned right-of-way, and to all

8-5-070: MASTER LICENSE AGREEMENTS:
A.   Authority: The City is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive
licenses governing the installation, construction, operation, use and
maintenance of wireless facilities and structures in ROW, in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter. Any such licenses will be granted through a
Master License Agreement entered into between the City and provider, and
subsequent site licenses that apply and extend the terms of the Master License
Agreement to specific locations in the ROW.
B.   Non-Discrimination: The City shall enter into Master License Agreements
with providers on a non-discriminatory basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the City may negotiate additional or different terms with different providers,
in the exercise of the City's reasonable discretion and pursuant to the City's
reserved police powers and the City's proprietary rights in the ROW.
C.   Term: Master License Agreements will be for an initial term of ten (10)
years (the "term"). At the end of the term, the Master License Agreement will
continue to apply to site licenses granted during the term. The term of a
Master License Agreement may be renewed if the provider is in compliance with
the Master License Agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,
including this chapter. At the expiration of the term of the Master License
Agreement, the provider shall remove its wireless facilities from the ROW
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the expiration of the Master License
Agreement or within one hundred eighty (180) days of the expiration of the site
license if the site license term expires after the term of the Master License

licenses or grant new site licenses after the term, until the City and the
provider have executed a new Master License Agreement with terms and conditions
acceptable to both the City and the provider. Site licenses will be for a term
of ten (10) years, and will be subject to all the terms and conditions of the
Master License Agreement in effect when the site license is granted.
D.   Compensation: The Master License Agreement will require the provider to
pay fair and reasonable compensation to the City, as determined by the City
Council, for: 1) the administrative expenses associated with entry into the
Master License Agreement and individual site licenses, 2) the provider's use of
ROW, including the City's expenses associated with maintenance and management
of the provider's use of ROW, and 3) other applicable fees. Specifically,
providers must pay the following fees:
1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City to review
applications, providers shall pay a non-refundable application fee for each
application for a site license or modification to a site license, as set forth
on the City's consolidated fee schedule as the same may be amended from time to
time. The application fee for collocating a small wireless facility on an
existing or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure shall be not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per collocation. The application fee
for installing, modifying, or replacing a utility pole in connection with a
permitted use shall be not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
utility pole. The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a
utility pole in connection with a discretionary use shall be not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per utility pole. The application fee must be paid
at the time the application is submitted to the City.
2.   Site License Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City of inspecting
and managing licensed wireless facilities, and to compensate the City for the
use of the ROW, the Master License Agreement will require providers to pay an
annual fee for each site license. The site license fee shall not be more than
the greater of: a) 3.5 percent of all gross revenue related to the provider's
use of ROW for small wireless facilities, or b) two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) annually for each small wireless facility. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no site license fee will be charged to a provider that is subject to
the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax, pursuant to Utah Code Annotated
section 10-1-401 et seq. For small wireless facilities collocated on City-owned
utility poles, the provider shall pay an annual fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
per pole in addition to the site license fee, if applicable, described above.
3.   Other Fees: Providers must also pay all other applicable fees established
in this Code, specifically including but not limited to fees for encroachment
permits and business licensing.
E.   Insurance, Indemnity, And Security: Prior to the execution of Master
License Agreement, a provider must deposit with the City an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit or surety bond as required by the terms of the
Master License Agreement, and shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance
coverage required by the Master License Agreement. A provider shall also
indemnify the City as set forth in the Master License Agreement.
F.   Ordinance Amendments: The City reserves the right to amend its ordinances
affecting this chapter at any time. The City shall give provider notice and an
opportunity to be heard concerning any proposed amendment. If there is any

8-5-080: SITE LICENSE APPLICATION:
A.   Application Requirements: To be considered for a site license, a provider
must submit an application to the Public Works Department, on a form provided
by the City. In addition to any information required on that form, the
application must include the following information:
1.   The type of site license sought, e.g., collocation of small wireless
facility, collocation of large wireless facility, installation of new utility
pole, or installation of new wireless support structure. If the site license is
for a collocation, the application must designate the type of structure on
which the wireless facility will be mounted, e.g., existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, an existing City-owned utility pole, etc.
2.   The location of the proposed wireless facility or structure, including the
designation of the proposed ROW as permitted or discretionary.
3.   A scaled site plan, rendering or photo simulation, scaled elevation view
and other supporting drawings and calculations, showing the location and
dimension of all improvements. The submittal must include sufficient
information to determine compliance with the standards and requirements of this
chapter, specifically including information concerning structure height and
location within the ROW, compliance with the City's intersection and driveway
sight distance standards, and compliance with the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
4.   An industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the structure on
which the wireless facilities will be mounted will safely support the load.
B.   Avoiding Redundant Submittals: The Public Works Department may allow a
provider to maintain on file with the Public Works Department any documentation
that would otherwise be required for each individual application, such as basic
wireless facility design documents and pole load analyses. The provider must
update any such information as necessary to keep it current.
C.   Exemption: If a provider desires to be exempted from the site license fee,
the provider must submit evidence that the provider is subject to the Municipal
Telecommunications License Tax pursuant to Utah Code Annotated section 10-1-401
et seq.
D.   Additional Information: The City may require the applicant to submit
additional information for any application for a site license for a
discretionary use. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-090: STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO WIRELESS FACILITIES IN RIGHTS- OF-WAY:
The following standards, requirements, and prohibitions apply to all wireless
facilities licensed pursuant to this chapter.
A.   Height: The maximum height of new or modified structures, including the
antenna and any part of the small wireless facility mounted on the structure,
is fifty feet (50') above ground level at the point of installation. The
antenna of a wireless facility may not extend more than ten feet (10') above
the top of an existing structure. All equipment permitted to be mounted on the
exterior of new or existing structures must be mounted at least eight feet (8')
above ground level.
B.   Placement: Wireless facilities and new structures must be placed in
locations that will not: 1) obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public
safety on the ROW; 2) create a public health or safety hazard, 3) obstruct,
damage, or interfere with another utility facility in the ROW, or the use of
such other utility facilities, 4) materially interfere with the safe operation
of traffic control equipment, 5) materially interfere with a sight line or a
clear zone for transportation or pedestrians, 6) materially interfere with
compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, and 7) violate applicable
laws or legal obligations.
C.   Design Requirements: Wireless facilities and new structures must be
architecturally integrated with existing buildings, structures and landscaping,
including considerations of height, color, style, placement, design and shape.
Exposed cabling is prohibited, except for collocations on existing structures
where internal cable routing is not feasible (e.g., on a wooden pole).
Horizontal protrusions from the structure must not exceed two feet (2'). New
structures must be of monopole design; lattice structures will not be
permitted. New structures must not be made of wood. To the extent feasible,
equipment shall be installed on the interior of new structures.
D.   Additional Design Requirements In Town Center Zone: In order to maintain
the historic character of the Town Center Zoning District, all wireless
facilities and new structures in the Town Center Zone must employ screening,
concealment, camouflage, or other stealth techniques to minimize visual
impacts.
E.   Electrical Service: Providers will be solely responsible for establishing
electrical power services for their wireless facilities and for the payment of
all electrical utility charges to the applicable electric service provider
based upon applicable tariffs.
F.   Undergrounding Of Lines: All fiber backhaul lines and electrical
distribution lines serving wireless facilities must be located underground,
unless the wireless facility is collocated on an existing structure that
already features above-ground lines, and the owner of the existing structure
agrees to provide communication or power service to the wireless facility
through those existing lines. The City may require that the new electrical
power line be overlashed on the existing electrical power line. Providers may
seek a waiver from this requirement in accordance with chapter 2 of this title.
G.   Compliance With Law: All wireless facilities must at all times comply with
all applicable Federal, State, and local Building Codes and Safety Codes and
regulations.
H.   Additional Requirements: Wireless facilities will be subject to any
additional requirements set forth in the applicable Master License Agreement
and site license.
I.   Decorative Poles: New or replacement utility poles must be designed to
reasonably conform to the design aesthetic of decorative poles in the vicinity,
if any. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-100: LICENSE APPROVAL OF PERMITTED USES:
A.   The Public Works Director has authority to approve applications for
permitted uses. The Public Works Director may deny an application for a
permitted use that does not comply with the requirements of this chapter,
specifically including but not limited to section
8-5-090 of this chapter. The Public Works Director shall forward any
applications for discretionary uses to the Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 1340, 8-
7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-110: LICENSE APPROVAL OF DISCRETIONARY USES:
A.   The Zoning Administrator has authority to approve applications for
discretionary uses.
B.   An application for a discretionary use will not be approved without prior
approval by the Zoning Administrator, following a public meeting.
C.   The Zoning Administrator is not required to approve an application for a
site license for a discretionary use unless the applicant establishes, by clear
and convincing evidence, that denial of the application would effectively
prohibit the applicant from providing wireless service.
D.   If the applicant fails to establish, by clear and convincing evidence,
that denial of the application would effectively prohibit the applicant from
providing wireless service, the Zoning Administrator may still approve an
application for a site license for discretionary use, if the Zoning
Administrator finds that it is in the best interests of the City to do so,
based on considerations of health, safety, or welfare. In making that
determination, the Zoning Administrator may consider comment from the general
public, specifically including members of the public that reside in the
vicinity of the proposed utility pole.
E.   The Zoning Administrator may approve an application for a site license
with conditions that further the goals of this chapter, specifically including
conditions that minimize any adverse effect of the wireless facility or
structure on adjacent properties. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)
8-5-120: MODIFICATIONS OF WIRELESS FACILITIES:
A.   A provider may not alter, modify, or enlarge a licensed small wireless
facility or utility pole without prior written consent from the City. To obtain
such consent, the provider must submit an application in accordance with
section
8-5-080 of this chapter.
B.   Applications for modifications to wireless facilities and structures will
be subject to the same standards, requirements, and processing deadlines as
applications for collocations.

application or obtain consent from the City for the following activities: 1)
routine maintenance on a small wireless facility or utility pole, 2)
replacement of a small wireless facility with a small wireless facility that is
substantially similar or smaller in size, and 3) the installation, placement,
maintenance, operation, or replacement of a micro wireless facility that is
strung on a cable between existing utility poles in compliance with the
National Electrical Safety Code. A provider must provide the City with advance
written notice of any such activity.
D.   A provider must apply for an encroachment permit in accordance with title
11, chapter 6 of this Code for any work that requires excavation or the closure
of sidewalks or vehicular lanes. The requirement to obtain an encroachment
permit applies even for work that is exempted from the application process
pursuant to subsection C of this section.
E.   Any approved modifications will be documented in a new or amended site
license. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018; amd. Ord. 1538, 4-19-2022)
8-5-130: APPLICATION PROCESSING:
A.   Consolidated Applications: A provider may submit a consolidated
application for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) wireless facilities,
so long as the wireless facilities are of substantially the same type, and
proposed for collocation on substantially the same types of structures. A
provider may submit a consolidated application for the installation,
modification, or replacement of up to twenty five (25) structures. In any
thirty (30) day period, a provider may not file more than: 1) one consolidated
application, or 2) multiple applications that collectively seek site licenses
for a combined total of more than twenty five (25) wireless facilities and
structures.
B.   Completeness: Within thirty (30) days after the date when an application
is submitted to the City, the City shall determine whether the application is
complete, and shall notify the provider of that determination in writing. If
the City determines that an application is incomplete, the City shall
specifically identify the missing information in the written notification. The
processing deadline will be tolled from the date when the City sends the
written notification until the date when the provider submits the missing
information. If the provider does not submit the missing information within
ninety (90) days after the date of the written notification, the application
will expire.
C.   Processing Deadlines: The City shall approve or deny applications in
accordance with the following deadlines:
1.   Applications for the collocation of small wireless facilities shall be
approved or denied within sixty (60) days after the day when the City receives
a complete application. The City may extend the deadline by a single additional
period of ten (10) business days by sending the applicant written notice of the
extension before the applicable deadline.
2.   Applications for new, modified, or replacement utility poles shall be
approved or denied within one hundred five (105) days after the day when the
City receives a complete application. The City may extend the deadline by a
single additional period of ten (10) business days by sending the applicant
written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.
D.   Denial: If the City denies an application, the City shall provide the
applicant with a written decision that documents the basis for the denial, and
shall send that decision to the applicant on or before the day that the City
denies the application. If the City denies an application for one or more
utility poles, or one or more small wireless facilities in a consolidated
application, the City shall not use that denial as a basis to delay the
application process for any other utility pole or small wireless facility in
the same consolidated application.
E.   Resubmittal: Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the City
denies an application, the applicant may cure the deficiencies noted in the
denial and resubmit the application without paying an application fee. The City
shall approve or deny the resubmitted application within thirty (30) days of
receipt, and shall limit its review to the deficiencies noted in the original
denial unless the applicant has changed another portion of the application.
F.   Installation Deadline: A site license will expire two hundred seventy
(270) days after approval if the licensed small wireless facility or utility
pole is not installed and operational. The foregoing deadline will be tolled
for any period of time during which the lack of commercial power or
communications facilities delays completion. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-
2018)

notify the parties in interest. Prior to the hearing the Zoning Administrator
shall transmit to the appellate body all papers constituting the record of the
action which is appealed.
3.   An appeal to the Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer shall not stay
proceedings taken in furtherance of the action appealed from unless such
proceedings are specifically stayed by order of the Zoning Administrator. An
appellant may request a stay by submitting to the Zoning Administrator, in
writing, a request for a stay setting forth the reasons why a stay is necessary
to protect against imminent harm. In determining whether or not to grant a
stay, the Zoning Administrator shall assure that all potentially affected
parties are given the opportunity to comment on the request. A ruling on the
request for a stay shall be given within five (5) days from the date the
request is received by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator, in
granting a stay, may impose additional conditions to mitigate any potential
harm that may be caused by the stay, including requiring the appellant to post
a bond.
4.   The Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing based
upon the record only, taking no new testimony or new information but relying
solely upon the information and final decision of the officer or body from whom
the appeal was taken. The Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer shall determine
the correctness of the lower decision and thereafter affirm or reverse, wholly
or in part, the lower decision, modify that decision, or impose any conditions
needed to conform the matter appealed to applicable approval standards. The
Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer shall have all the powers of the officer
or body from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of
a site license.
5.   After the Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer makes a decision, the
Zoning Administrator shall give the applicant written notice of the decision.
The decision takes effect on the date when the Appeal Authority issues a
written decision.
6.   A record of all appeals shall be maintained in the Office of the Zoning
Administrator. (Ord. 1340, 8-7-2018, eff. 8-31-2018)

9-1-060: ORGANIZATION OF TITLE:
This section describes the basic organizational scheme used in this title and
the types of regulations found herein. It is intended to be informational only.
Failure to follow the format described in this section shall not be a basis for
invalidating any action taken pursuant to this title.
A.   Organizational Structure: This title consists of six (6) articles, as
follows:
1.   Article 1, General Provisions.
2.   Article 2, Administration And Enforcement.
3.   Article 3, Base Zones.
4.   Article 4, Special Purpose And Overlay Zones.
5.   Article 5, Regulations Of General Applicability.
6.   Article 6, Regulations For Specific Uses.
B.   General Provisions: The general provisions of article 1 of this title
establish how this title is applied, sets forth the relationship of planning
documents, such as the general plan, to this title, and provides rules and
definitions for interpreting and applying the provisions of this title.
C.   Administration And Enforcement: Administration and enforcement provisions,
in article 2 of this title, include creation and allocation of powers and
duties of decision making bodies and officials, land use application and public
hearing and application review procedures, appeals, and variances. Enforcement
provisions set forth remedies available to the city to enforce violations of
this title.
D.   Types Of Zones: This title establishes three (3) types of zones (also
called "zoning districts"): base zones, special purpose zones, and overlay
zones.
1.   Base zones are zoning districts that reflect the city's five (5) basic
land use categories: agricultural, residential, commercial, public facilities,
and industrial. Base zones establish regulations and development standards
governing land uses allowed in these zones.
2.   Special purpose zones consist of regulations that apply only in limited
instances or to special circumstances.
3.   Overlay zone regulations address specific circumstances that apply in a
variety of geographic areas, such as historic or environmentally sensitive
areas, which may traverse the boundaries of a number of base zones.
E.   Types Of Regulations: This title includes land use regulations and
development standards.
1.   Base zone regulations, found in article 3 of this title, specify land uses
allowed as of right or allowed after issuance of a conditional use permit.
These regulations may be modified by overlay zone regulations, set forth in
article 4 of this title, or augmented by regulations for specific uses found in
article 6 of this title. Base zone and overlay regulations are augmented by
regulations of general applicability found in article 5 of this title.
2.   Development standards include fixed dimensional standards and performance
standards. Development standards control the height, size, location and other
particular aspects of structures and uses on sites intended for development.
These standards also prescribe buffering requirements between zones and between
potentially incompatible uses.
a.   Fixed dimensional standards are numerical maximum or minimum conditions
which govern development on a site.
b.   Performance standards establish certain criteria which must be met, but
allow flexibility as to the method of meeting the criteria. (Ord. 394, 8-7-
2001)

extension prior to the date of expiration. The total period of time granted by
any such extension or extensions shall not exceed half the length of the

civil or criminal proceeding.
2.   No conditional use permit shall be revoked against the wishes of the
holder or user of the permit without first giving such person an opportunity to
appear before the Planning Commission and show cause as to why the permit
should not be amended or revoked. Revocation of a permit shall not limit the
City's ability to initiate or complete other legal proceedings against the
holder or user of the permit.

permit within one year from the date of its issuance, said permit shall expire
and shall have no further force or effect. A written request may be submitted

and decide variances to the provisions of this title as provided in this
section.
C.   Initiation: A property owner, or the owner's agent, may request a variance

administrator in a form established by the administrator, along with any fee
established by the city's schedule of fees. The application shall include at
least the following information:
a.   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant and the
applicant's agent, if any.
b.   The address and parcel identification of the subject property.
c.   The specific feature or features of the proposed use, construction or
development that require a variance.
d.   The specific provision of this title from which the variance is sought and
the precise variance being sought.
e.   A statement of the characteristics of the subject property that prevent
compliance with the provisions of this title and result in unnecessary
hardship.
f.   A statement of the minimum variation needed to permit the proposed use,
construction or development.
g.   An explanation of how the application satisfies each standard set forth in
subsection E of this section.
h.   A plot plan showing the following:
(1)   Applicant's name;
(2)   Site address;
(3)   Property boundaries and dimensions;
(4)   Layout of existing and proposed buildings, parking, landscaping, and
utilities; and
(5)   Adjoining property lines and uses within one hundred feet (100') of the
subject property.
i.   An elevation plan drawn to scale showing all elevations of existing and
proposed structures.
j.   When the variance involves building height, a streetscape plan showing the
height of all buildings within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the subject
property.

a licensed surveyor, showing existing topography in dashed lines at two foot
(2') intervals and showing the proposed grade in solid lines at two foot (2')
intervals.
l.   When a variance involves retaining walls, a plan showing all retaining
walls, including their height relative to proposed grades.
m.   Any other information identified by the zoning administrator to be
pertinent to the requested variance. (Ord. 394, 8-7-2001)

administrator shall schedule a public hearing before the appeals and variance
hearing officer as provided in section
9-5-040 of this chapter. Notice of the meeting should be given as provided in
section
9-5-045 of this chapter.
3.   A staff report evaluating the application shall be prepared by the zoning
administrator.
4.   The appeals and variance hearing officer shall hold a public meeting and
thereafter shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application
pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection E of this section. Any
conditions of approval shall be limited to conditions needed to conform the
variance to approval standards.
5.   After the appeals and variance hearing officer makes a decision, the
zoning administrator shall give the applicant written notice of the decision.
6.   A record of all variances shall be maintained in the office of the zoning
administrator.
E.   Approval Standards: The following standards shall apply to a variance:
1.   The appeals and variance hearing officer may grant a variance only if:
a.   Literal enforcement of this title would cause an unreasonable hardship for
the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general purpose of this
title;
b.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same zoning district;
c.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial
property right possessed by other property in the same zoning district;
d.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not
be contrary to the public interest; and
e.   The spirit of this title is observed and substantial justice done.
2.   The appeals and variance hearing officer may find an unreasonable hardship
exists only if the alleged hardship is located on or associated with the
property for which the variance is sought and comes from circumstances peculiar
to the property, not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood. The
appeals and variance hearing officer may not find an unreasonable hardship
exists if the hardship is self-imposed or economic.
3.   The appeals and variance hearing officer may find that special
circumstances exist only if the special circumstances relate to the hardship
complained of and deprive the property of privileges granted to other
properties in the same zoning district.
4.   An applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions
justifying a variance have been met.
5.   A use variance may not be granted.
6.   In granting a variance, the appeals and variance hearing officer may
impose additional requirements on an applicant that will mitigate any harmful
affects of the variance, or serve the purpose of the standard or requirement
that is waived or modified.
7.   A variance more restrictive than that requested may be authorized when the
record supports the applicant's right to some relief but not to the extent
requested.
F.   Appeal Of Decision: Appeals of a decision of the appeals and variance
hearing officer regarding a variance are governed by subsection
9-4-050(I) of this title.
G.   Effect Of Approval: A variance shall not authorize the establishment of
any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or
moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any approvals or
permits that may be required by this title or other applicable provisions of
this code.
H.   Amendments: The procedure for amending any variance decision shall be the

hearing officer shall:

officer or body from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the
issuance of a permit.

written decision.

and uses within the city, and to any other matter governed by this title. Any
lot or parcel, structure, or use that was legally established on or before the
effective date of this title may be continued to the extent that it legally
existed on such date and conforms to applicable provisions of this chapter. Any
lot, structure, or use which was not authorized by under preexisting zoning

3.   Otherwise conforms to the requirements of this title.
C.   Nonconforming Use Of Open Land: A nonconforming use of open land may be
continued provided such nonconforming use shall not be expanded or extended
into any other portion of a conforming building or open land, and no
structures, additions, alterations, or enlargements thereto shall be made
thereon, except those required by law.
D.   Expansion Of Outdoor Nonconforming Uses: A nonconforming use of a lot or
parcel where the principal use is not enclosed within a building, such as a
salvage yard or a motor vehicle sales lot, shall not be expanded except in
conformity with the requirements of this title. (Ord. 394, 8-7-2001)
9-6-050: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A.   Continuation: A nonconforming structure in any zone may be continued as
provided in this chapter so long as no additions or enlargements are made

required by law. If any nonconforming structure is removed from the lot or
parcel on which it was located, each future structure thereon shall conform to
the provisions of this title.

increases the degree of nonconformance is prohibited, except as provided in
this subsection:
1.   The initial determination of whether a proposed expansion increases the
degree of nonconformity shall be made by the zoning administrator. (Ord. 394,
8-7-2001)
2.   A structure which is nonconforming as to height, area, or yard regulations
may be added to or enlarged upon authorization by the appeals and variance
hearing officer; provided, that the appeals and variance hearing officer, after
a hearing, finds the expansion to be compatible with the neighborhood and not
detrimental to the community, as determined by the effect of the expansion on
traffic, value of adjacent and nearby properties, and the availability of
adequate public facilities and services. (Ord. 815, 4-1-2008, eff. 7-1-2008)
D.   Relocation: If a nonconforming structure is relocated within the city, it
shall be placed only in a location where it fully conforms with the
requirements of this title.

earthquake, or other disaster may be restored as it existed previously and its
use may be continued so long as restoration is complete within one year, except
that buildings on the state or Draper City historic register may be restored so
long as restoration is initiated within twelve (12) months and complete within
twenty four (24) months.
F.   Unsafe Structures: Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit
the continuing use of a structure found to be in violation of any applicable
life safety or health code. The right to continue use of a nonconforming
structure shall be subject to the life safety requirements of applicable
housing, building, health, and other life safety codes. (Ord. 394, 8-7-2001)

a structure legally established before the effective date of this title, then
the owner may continue the then existing use of such structure and may expand
the structure in any way that does not increase the degree of nonconformity. An
increase in structure size shall not be deemed to increase the degree of
nonconformity of the lot or parcel unless the structure increases any
encroachment into a required setback. Remodeling of a structure within an
existing footprint or expansion in compliance with this section shall not
require a variance but shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator as though
the lot or parcel were conforming.
D.   Accessory Buildings: Accessory buildings customarily incidental to a
dwelling may be constructed on nonconforming lots, provided:
1.   The building shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet in floor

9-6-050 and
9-6-060 of this chapter.
A.   Nonconforming Development With Approved Site Plan: Nonconforming
development that is consistent with a site plan approved before the effective
date of this title shall be deemed to be in conformance with this title to the
extent that it is consistent with the approved site plan and to the extent that
such plan or conditions imposed thereon directly address the specific issue
involved in a determination of conformity. A nonconformity other than one of
those enumerated in sections
9-6-040,
9-6-050, and
9-6-060 of this chapter shall be brought into conformance upon the occurrence
of any one of the following:
1.   Any increase of more than thirty percent (30%) floor area or fifty percent
(50%) of the County Assessor’s Office assessed value of the building or
premises.
2.   For a lot or parcel located in a commercial or industrial zone, any change
in use to a more intensive use when a new certificate of occupancy is required.

the result of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public
purpose and the remaining area or setback is at least seventy five percent

parcel shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and
setback standards of this title without any need for a variance.

lot area or setbacks, as a result of the conveyance of property to a federal,
state, or local government for a public purpose, the owner may continue the
existing use of the lot, parcel, or structure on the lot or parcel. Any
subsequent alterations to the lot or parcel, other than the portion of the lot
or parcel rendered nonconforming by public action, shall comply with this title
and shall not increase the degree of nonconformity caused by the public action.

condemnation of unsafe structures.
B.   Overcoming Presumption Of Abandonment: A presumption of abandonment may be
rebutted upon evidence presented by the owner showing no intent to abandon the
use, structure, or other nonconformity. Such evidence may include proof that
during the alleged period of abandonment the owner has done either of the
following:
1.   Maintained the lot and structure, if any, in accordance with the building
code; or

nonconforming lot, structure, or use lawfully exists under this title. (Ord.
394, 8-7-2001)

1447, 8-4-2020)
9-8-020: ZONE PURPOSES:
In addition to the general purposes of this title as set forth in section
9-1-030 of this title, the various zones each serve more specific purposes as
set forth below:
A.   Agricultural Zones: Agricultural zones are established to preserve and
protect agricultural lands and related activities, to permit activities
normally and necessarily related to agricultural production, and to prohibit
land uses that may undermine continued agricultural activity.
1.   The purpose of the A5 zone is to maintain the status of large tracts of
agricultural land by allowing most commercial agricultural uses. Typical uses
include farming, dairy, and cattle production.
2.   The purpose of the A2 zone is to allow a lifestyle that includes generally
noncommercial agricultural uses on large lots. Typical uses include estate
lots, noncommercial stables, and other equestrian facilities.
B.   Residential Zones: Residential zones are established to provide a wide
range of residential land uses at various densities. These zones are intended
to protect the stability of neighborhoods and to encourage, collectively,
diverse types of desirable new residential development and to protect existing
residential uses.
1.   The purpose of the RA1 and RA2 zones is to foster low density development
with little impact on its surroundings and municipal services; to generally
preserve the character of the city's semirural areas; and to promote and
preserve conditions favorable to large lot family life, including the keeping
of limited numbers of animals and fowl. The predominant use in these zones is
intended to be detached single-family dwellings, protected from encroachment by
commercial and industrial uses.
2.   The purpose of the RH zone is to allow large scale, master planned
residential development in foothill and mountainous areas. Developed areas are
intended to consist of various types of clustered dwellings on relatively small
lots, together with carefully limited commercial development. To achieve
relatively low overall densities, developed areas are intended to be offset by
large tracts of conservation land.
3.   The purpose of the R3 zone is to permit medium density residential
development without special mitigation requirements. This zone is intended to
provide incentives to foster residential development with little impact on its
surroundings and on municipal services, and to generally preserve the semirural
character called for in the density element of the general plan.
4.   The purpose of the R4 and R5 zones is to permit medium to medium-high
density residential developments with single-family homes. These zones are
intended to foster thriving and well maintained neighborhoods that allow
upscale single-family homes on smaller lots that require less maintenance and
provide a balanced lifestyle.
5.   The purpose of the RM1 and RM2 zones is to permit well designed
apartments, townhomes, twin homes, and condominiums at relatively high
densities that are appropriately buffered from and compatible with surrounding
land uses.
C.   Commercial Zones: Commercial zones are established to provide areas where
a combination of business, commercial, entertainment, office, and related
activities may be established, maintained and protected. Commercial zones are
intended to provide a suitable environment for those commercial and service
uses which are vital to the economic base of the city.
1.   The purpose of the CN zone is to provide areas where convenience buying
outlets, having small trade areas, may be established to serve surrounding
residential neighborhoods. This zone is intended to promote a combination of
retail and service facilities which, in character and scale, meet day to day
needs of nearby residents.
2.   The purpose of the CC zone is to provide areas where commercial uses may
be established which are generally oriented toward local residents rather than
out of town patrons. Uses typical of this zone include planned retail and
office development.
3.   The purpose of the CR zone is to provide areas where a combination of
destination oriented business, retail commercial, entertainment, and related
uses may be established, maintained and protected to serve both residents and
nonresidents of the city. Typical uses in this zone include large scale, master
planned commercial centers with outlying commercial pads, big box stores, and
offices.
4.   The purpose of the CG zone is to provide areas to accommodate commercial
uses which are not within shopping centers of integrated design. This zone is
intended to apply to existing "strip commercial" developments. The zone should
not be used for new commercial development unless integrated shopping center
development is not practical or desirable because of difficult size, shape,
topography, or similar problems related to land otherwise deemed to be
appropriate for commercial use. Typical uses in this zone include offices,
retail stores, personal services, heavy commercial, and institutional uses.
5.   The purpose of the CI zone is to provide areas with visibility and access
from Interstate 15 that are commuter and traveler oriented. Typical uses
include lodging facilities, personal services, travel plazas, restaurants and
fast food facilities, and commuter parking.
6.   The purpose of the CBP zone is to provide aesthetically attractive planned
developments having a mix of office, research and development, light
manufacturing, and limited retail uses. Typical uses in this zone include
offices, clean indoor manufacturing facilities, service retail, restaurants,
athletic clubs, personal service shops, medical offices, office/warehouse
buildings, and research facilities.
7.   The purpose of the CO zone is to provide locations primarily along
arterial or major collector streets which will accommodate offices or
laboratories for professional persons and other related uses. The zone is
intended to provide availability of professional services conveniently to all
neighborhoods in the city. Two (2) CO zones are provided: CO1 and CO2. CO1
zones are intended to allow office and related uses on relatively small tracts
of land so they can be conveniently and compatibly located adjacent to
residential areas. CO2 zones allow larger office and related use developments
adjacent to commercial areas and away from residential areas. Typical uses in
this zone include offices for doctors, dentists, accountants, and other similar
professions, medical and dental laboratories, and pharmacies.
8.   The purpose of the TC town center zone is to provide a method for
implementing special provisions found within the general plan and the Draper
City conservation area master plan regarding the establishment and promotion of
a historic core area of the community characterized by stringent design
standards for buildings, public spaces, site design and landscaping with a
harmonious mix of commercial uses, limited high density residential uses and
civic areas.
9.   The purpose of the DC zone is to provide an area that is uniquely regional
in nature, with lodging, food establishments, retail, office, service uses, and
entertainment as the only allowed uses.
10.   The purpose of the CS commercial services zone is to provide areas for
uses that are not typically allowed in commercial zones but are lower impact
and less intrusive in nature as they relate to surrounding residential
neighborhoods. This zone is intended to be relatively limited in scope and
application. Typical uses may include office and storage units.
11.   The Major Freeway Arterial Frontage zone is located at approximately
14875 South Minuteman Drive bordered by Minuteman Drive and Marion Vista.
Railroad lines abut the property on the south. The size, unusual shape and
unique location of the property allows for a master planned project with a
potential for office, commercial, multiple-family dwellings, and other uses.
The property has immediate proximity to major transportation corridors such as
Interstate-15 Frontage Road (Minuteman Drive) and almost direct access to I-15
at the 14600 South interchange. The property has a distinct topography and
exposure to freeway traffic and is located away from single-family residential
neighborhoods.
12.   The primary purpose of the Commercial Buffer Zone (CBU) is to support low
intensity commercial uses that act as a buffer between existing residential
neighborhoods and commercial development. Adopted design guidelines may be
applicable when zones are adjacent to the town center (TC) zoning
classification.
D.   Public Facility Zones: Public facility zones are established to provide
public or quasi-public uses.
1.   The purpose of the PF zone is to provide areas for facilities owned by
public and quasi-public entities and which utilize relatively large areas of
land. This zone is intended to provide immediate recognition of such areas on
the official zoning map. Typical uses in this zone are cemeteries, hospitals,
open air theaters, public parks, public schools, and public utility facilities.
2.   The purpose of the OS zone is to recognize on the official zoning map
areas which are open and generally undevelopable due to their sensitive
environmental nature and/or the unavailability of adequate public facilities,
such as conservation areas and national forest land.
3.   The purpose of the PI zone is to provide areas for educational
institutions, municipal uses, and athletic facilities, whether publicly or
privately owned, that host organized team sports. These uses would utilize
relatively large areas of land, and would be established for the health and
betterment of the community at large. This zone is intended to provide
immediate recognition of such areas on the official zoning map. Typical uses in
this zone are schools, parks, municipal facilities, and sports complexes.
E.   Manufacturing Zones: Manufacturing zones are established to provide areas
where manufacturing and industrial processes may be conducted.
1.   The purpose of the M1 zone is to provide areas for uses involving
processing and assembly of manufactured goods, warehousing, and material
storage. Uses which generate excessive noise, vibration, odor, dust, and fumes
are excluded from this zone.
2.   The purpose of the M2 zone is to provide areas where uses involving
industrial processes and natural resource extraction may be permitted without
negatively impacting other areas of the city, especially when undertaken on a
large scale. To assure compatibility with uses in other adjacent zones, most
manufacturing operations are allowed only as conditional uses.
F.   Special Purpose And Overlay Zones: Special purpose and overlay zones are
established to provide a means of implementing supplemental regulations that
apply geographically, regardless of the underlying base zone, if applicable.
Whenever the regulations of a base zone and an overlay zone conflict, the
overlay zone regulations shall apply.
1.   The purpose of the OSL zone is to provide regulations to protect sensitive
land areas such as hillsides, floodplains, and river parkway areas.
2.   The purpose of the OHD zone is to implement regulations designed to
promote the preservation of structures and sites having historical, cultural,
or architectural significance, and to foster economic development consistent
with historic preservation plans adopted by the city.
3.   The purpose of the OMP zone is to provide a method for implementing
special provisions found in various master plans, such as the Bangerter
interchange area, Draper City conservation area, gateway, northern gateway, and
Southpointe master plans.
4.   The purpose of the MPC zone is to promote high quality, innovative and
creative large scale development that includes a mixture of residential,
commercial and employment uses, varying densities, heights, setbacks, lot sizes
and sufficient diversity of housing types. The MPC zone is designed to preserve
open space, provide parks, trails and recreational uses with a desirable living
and working environment with unique identity and character.
5.   The purpose of each CSD zone is to permit a compatible, master planned mix
of day and evening uses consisting of office, light manufacturing, retail,
residential, recreation and open space components. Although development size
and use mix will vary from location to location, each development is intended
to consist of well designed, architecturally integrated structures which are
appropriately landscaped and buffered from surrounding land uses.

B.   Ambiguous Use Classification: If ambiguity arises concerning the
appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of
this title, the following process applies:
1.   Application: An applicant may submit a classification request to the
Zoning Administrator to determine if a proposed business use aligns with an
existing permitted or conditional use in this title. The application shall
include information specified by the Zoning Administrator, such as use
description, operational details, and site plans.
2.   Zoning Administrator Review: The Zoning Administrator shall determine if
the proposed use is substantially similar to an existing permitted or
conditional use based on the following criteria:
a.   Type of goods and services provided;
b.   Number of customers and employees;
c.   Amount and type of on-site storage; and
d.   Noise, odor, or vibration generated.

proceed under the regulations applicable to that use.
4.   New Or Unlisted Business Use: If the Zoning Administrator determines the
proposed use is a new or unlisted business use not substantially similar to an
existing use, the applicant may submit the application to the City Council for
review. The City Council shall review the application at a public meeting
within sixty (60) days of submission, provided the applicant responds to
requests for additional information within ten (10) business days and attends
required meetings. The City Council shall approve or deny the new or unlisted
business use based on consistency with the Draper City General Plan, public
health and safety, and zoning compatibility. If approved, the City Council
shall designate one or more appropriate zones for the use and direct staff to
amend this title to incorporate the use as a permitted or conditional use in
those zones. For site-specific or temporary uses, the City Council may
designate zones via resolution, provided staff proposes a code amendment within
one hundred eighty (180) days for uses intended for broader application. If
denied, the City Council shall provide written reasons for the denial, and
staff shall amend this title to add the use to the prohibited uses list in
Section

(Ord. 1283, 10-17-2017; amd. Ord. 1437, 5-19-2020)
9-10-080: PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE:
A.   Purpose: The purpose of the Planned Residential District is to encourage
imaginative and innovative planning of residential neighborhoods which are not
located in the City's Sensitive Lands Overlay Zone, to encourage the
preservation of open space and significant natural features, to offer a wide
variety of dwelling unit sizes and types, to permit greater flexibility in
design of residential neighborhoods, and to enable development of larger
parcels of property that would be difficult or less desirable to develop under
conventional zoning and subdivision regulations.
B.   Qualification:
1.   No planned residential development (PRD) shall be established on any
parcel located within the Sensitive Lands Overlay Zone. The minimum area to
establish a PRD Zone is ten (10) acres.
2.   No PRD shall be approved that does not comply with all development
requirements found within this chapter.
3.   No PRD application shall be accepted for property that has altered its
natural condition through grading or land disturbance permit activity, within
five (5) years prior to the application date for a PRD.
C.   Scope: A planned residential development is a residential development
improved in accordance with an overall project plan and is characterized by the
following:
1.   The density regulations of the zone in which the planned residential
development is located are applied to the total developable area of the planned
residential development rather than separately to individual lots and is
related to the density recommendations of the General Plan.
2.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply only to any real property
located in a single-family residential zone as shown on the official zoning
map; land which lies within the Sensitive Lands Overlay Zone is not eligible to
utilize the PRD provisions of this Code. Residential zones eligible for a PRD
Overlay are the RA1, RA2, and R3 Zones; RH, RM1 and RM2 Zones are not eligible
for a PRD Overlay. Other nonresidential zones within Draper City are not
eligible for a PRD Overlay. No building, structure or real property shall be
used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, structurally or
substantially altered, or enlarged except as set forth in this chapter. Such
requirements shall not be construed to prohibit or limit other applicable
provisions of this title, this Code, or other laws.
3.   Zoning directly from agricultural, commercial, manufacturing, open space,
or institutional zoning to PRD is not allowed. Establishment of a base
residential zone, which conforms to the land use recommendations of the Draper
City General Plan, is required prior to submitting an application for PRD
zoning and subsequent development approval.
D.   Uses Allowed:
1.   Permitted And Conditional Uses: Permitted and conditional uses allowed
within residential zones shall be as set forth in section
9-10-090,
table 9-10-1 of this chapter. Permitted and conditional uses are indicated by a
"P" or "C", respectively, in the appropriate column. Uses not permitted are
indicated by "NP".
2.   Accessory Uses: The permitted and conditional uses set forth in section
9-10-090,
table 9-10-1 of this chapter shall be deemed to include accessory uses and
activities that are necessarily and customarily associated with and incidental
and subordinate to such uses.
a.   Accessory uses shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to
permitted and conditional uses in the base zone except as otherwise expressly
provided in this title.
b.   No accessory use, building, or structure shall be allowed on a lot or
parcel unless a permitted or conditional use has been established.
c.   Accessory uses in residential zones shall include all accessory uses
allowed in the underlying residential zoning classification.
3.   Allowed Animal Rights: Although the underlying base zone may be RA1 or RA2
zoning, animal rights require special consideration within a PRD due to the
potential for small lots and townhomes which cannot adequately support animals
within their property. Therefore, within any PRD, the following requirements
are in place and supersede the base zone requirements for the care and keeping
of animals:
a.   The base residential zone shall be RA1 or RA2.
b.   The minimum parcel size to apply for large animal rights is twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet.
c.   A conditional use permit is required to establish large animal rights.
d.   One animal unit per twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of lot area is
the basic conditional use permit request.
e.   Additional animal units may be requested as part of the conditional use
permit request if it can be shown that all standard conditional use permit
evaluative criteria and required findings can be adequately met.
E.   Application Requirements: A PRD overlay is considered to be a legislative
act of rezoning a parcel of land, and a rezoning application shall follow the
standard zone map amendment process established by this title. A PRD approval
process cannot begin prior to city council establishment of an underlying RA1,
RA2 or R3 residential zone. In addition to the standard zone map amendment
application requirements, a PRD application shall be accompanied by a
development plan and concept subdivision plan which shall consist of:
1.   A professionally drawn map or maps drawn to a suitable scale, showing at
least the following:
a.   The boundary of the proposed district.
b.   The topographic character of the land, at two foot (2') contour intervals.
c.   General drainage analysis and proposal.
d.   Accommodations for all utilities, showing a plan for location of utility
boxes and facilities.
e.   The extent of grading intended for roads, utilities and building pads.
f.   The location of all public streets and proposed street cross sections.
g.   Location of public or common area uses proposed, such as schools, parks,
open space, playgrounds, bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trails, or other
recreational facilities. Public and private uses shall be specifically
delineated.
h.   The location and configuration of different densities of dwelling units,
showing lot sizes and ownership type.
i.   Where appropriate, said plan shall include recommendations on buffering
from surrounding uses, such as intensive landscaping, building height
limitations, and in rare circumstances, fences and walls. A substantial buffer
shall be required when adjacent to property where large animal rights are
allowed by permitted or conditional use (A5, A2, RA1, and RA2 zoning).
j.   Within the planned residential development, lots and units may be
established of various size and type but shall be logical in size and shape and
shall function by themselves and in relationship to other development units
within the district or adjacent property.
k.   Site inventory of trees four inch (4") caliper or greater, and which trees
are identified for preservation.
l.   Any and all requirements for a concept subdivision plan as required by
this title and title 17 of this code.
2.   A development program including:
a.   A legal description of the district boundary.
b.   Size of the area.
c.   The overall density proposed, and shown as total units per gross acre of
developable land.
d.   The type and mix of development units proposed, as well as four (4) sided
architectural renderings.
e.   The disposition of all lands proposed for private ownership, public
facilities or common ownership.
f.   A phasing schedule if the applicant contemplates construction in
increments.
g.   The approximate size or range of anticipated dwelling size, in square
feet, of each development unit.
h.   General landscaping and street tree plan, including proposals for
buffering.
i.   Street design standards, public.
j.   Proposed project amenities, including all buildings, equipment, furniture,
special landscaping features, recreational elements, and streetlighting.
3.   All proposed restrictive covenants. Covenants shall include all necessary
legal mechanisms to maintain common areas. The proposed covenants shall include
a proposal on fee collection and an entity for administration of the covenants
and homeowners' association, and shall contain at least the following elements:
a.   Membership in the HOA shall be mandatory for all property owners within
the PRD.
b.   The covenants, conditions and restrictions shall incorporate appropriate
provisions for the establishment and maintenance of long term PRD site
development standards, including enforcement mechanisms designed to assure
coherent, coordinated development, maintenance and use activity with the PRD
site.
c.   All improvements that are not dedicated to the city or accepted for
ownership or maintenance by the city shall be perpetually maintained through a
special district owners' association with the power to assess and collect fees
for maintenance or other assessment and maintenance mechanisms acceptable to
the city.
d.   Establishment of a reserve account for the replacement of all items of
common property which will normally require replacement or maintenance within
three (3) to thirty (30) years. An inventory of such items shall be required as
part of this component.
e.   Potential buyers shall be informed of the full implications of purchasing
within an HOA and the requirements that may be placed upon them as a resident
and owner full disclosure is required to be recorded with the plat.
f.   Errors in the CCRs and HOA documents should be easily correctable by not
requiring voting by all members for document changes, but rather a certain
percentage of the HOA members. Documents must be able to be corrected to ensure
its success.
g.   The formation of the HOA meeting these criteria shall be established by
the developer prior to final plat approval, and shall be reviewed and approved
by the city attorney prior to plat recordation.
h.   A property owner shall automatically obtain member status upon purchase of
property within the PRD.
4.   All requirements of the natural resources inventory, required in chapter
24 of this title.
5.   All conditions agreed to by the applicant which are not included in the
written documentation required under subsections A, B, C and D of this section
are part of the development plan.
F.   Design Criteria And Development Standards: The planned residential
development shall observe the following design criteria:
1.   The overall plan shall be comprehensive, embracing land, buildings,
landscaping and their interrelationships and shall conform in all respects to
all adopted plans of all governmental agencies for the area in which the
proposed development is located.
2.   The plan shall provide for a minimum of twenty five percent (25%)
projectwide open space, circulation, off street parking, and pertinent
amenities, and projectwide off street walkability and pedestrian scale design.
Buildings, structures and facilities in the parcel shall be well integrated,
oriented and related to the topographic and natural landscape features of the
site.
3.   The proposed development shall be compatible with existing and planned
land use, and with circulation patterns on adjoining properties. It shall not
constitute a disruptive element to the neighborhood and community.
4.   The internal street system shall not be a dominant feature in the overall
design; rather it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of
vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function
of any common areas and facilities. The design of streetscapes shall be of a
design that exceeds the standard subdivision street tree and streetlighting
requirements.
5.   Common areas and recreational facilities shall be located so as to be
readily accessible to the occupants of the dwelling units and shall be well
related to any common open spaces provided. Public open space, trails, and
facilities shall be located in a manner to maximize access for the general
public.
6.   Architecture and landscape design shall be in harmony within the
development and within the neighborhood and community. The development plan
shall emphasize curb appeal, deemphasize the garage behind the main building
line, and utilize high quality building materials, such as brick, stone, and
synthetic concrete stone and upgraded siding type products throughout the
development and as elements on all sides of buildings. Aluminum and vinyl
siding are prohibited.
7.   A surveyed tree inventory shall be submitted with the application, and all
trees over four inch (4") caliper shall be identified for preservation. A
recommendation from a certified arborist shall be included where trees are
proposed to be removed due to disease or infestation. Trees earmarked for
removal shall be transplanted to landscape and buffer areas, using best
management practices.
8.   Where adjacent to natural undeveloped open space areas, such as the Jordan
River Parkway, Willow Creek, and Corner Creek, extreme sensitivity in design
shall be given to the interface between public and private lands and trails,
fencing design and wildlife compatibility issues. Where possible and desired by
the city, project open space shall extend the natural open spaces rather than
separate geographically such areas and proposed parks.
9.   All parks and main trails shall be connected by internal trails.
10.   All single-family dwellings shall maintain a minimum ten foot (10') side
yard setback.
11.   All garages shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet (20') from the
back of sidewalk or planned right of way.
G.   Property Development Standards:
1.   All land uses in a PRD district shall conform to the allowable uses of the
underlying zoning district. Modifications of the underlying district's
development standards may be allowed only as provided in the modifications
procedure below.
2.   Any use requiring a conditional use permit in the underlying zoning
district shall obtain approval as outlined in section
9-5-080 of this title prior to the establishment of the use.
3.   Except as expressly provided herein, all provisions of the zoning and
subdivision ordinances shall apply to development in the PRD district.
4.   The area proposed for a PRD shall be in one ownership or control during
development to provide for full supervision and control of said development,
and to ensure conformance with these provisions and all conditions imposed upon
the preliminary and final subdivision plats. Mere development agreements
between individuals shall not satisfy this requirement. Individual ownership,
partnerships, corporations, and other legally recognized entities are
acceptable. The city shall have the right to review all documents establishing
legal entities.
5.   All public streets shall conform to adopted city cross sections and
construction standards. Private streets or lanes are not allowed within a PRD.
6.   Street trees shall be of a species that will create a large tree canopy
and which are suited to the development and soil conditions of the property.
Small canopy, columnar, and ornamental trees shall be limited in the approved
landscape plan to accent areas, common areas, and small buffer areas, but are
not to be utilized as formal street tree plantings. The Draper City tree guide
shall provide guidance for appropriate trees.
7.   No remnant parcels shall be created. Any land not proposed for development
shall be designated as open space or common areas, as appropriate.
8.   The final development plans shall be prepared by a design team composed of
an architect, a landscape architect, a civil engineer, a geotechnical engineer,
a registered geologist, and a land surveyor, all licensed to practice in the
state of Utah. A statement identifying the team shall be part of the
development application. Where necessary, documents and submittals shall
contain the wet stamp and wet signature of the licensed professional.
H.   Property Development Standards Modification Procedure:
1.   Modifications to minimum lot and yard standards may be approved by the
city in connection with a PRD overlay zone, subject to compliance with the
maximum overall density and lot yield for the property.
2.   The application shall be accompanied by written terminology and graphic
material, which shall illustrate the conditions that the modified standards
will produce, so that the planning commission and city council can make the
determination that the modification will produce a living environment,
landscape quality and project superior to that produced by the standard
residential development standards.
I.   Requirements For All PRDs:
1.   Base Density: Developable land is land under thirty percent (30%) slope
which is capable of being improved with landscaping, recreational facilities,
buildings, streets, or parking. Developable land does not include identified
watercourses, to the typical high water flow line. The hypothetical base
density of a subdivision shown below only represents a calculated average of
land development in Draper City, based on the minimum requirements of the base
zone, and the typical city street dedication requirements, and shall be applied
to only defined developable land within a proposed PRD; it is shown for
demonstrative purposes only. The specific project density for any application
may differ from these hypothetical numbers due to any number of development
related factors, and could be higher or lower. Specific density calculations
are found in subsection I3 of this section.
 
Base Zone Hypothetical Base Density
RA1       0.90
RA2       1.60
R3        2.30
 
2.   Required Components For All PRDs:
a.   Provision Of Public Open Space: This shall mean the provision of common
open space which is distinguishable by its quantity or quality and which is
readily accessible to the residents of the development and the public.
Opportunities to connect to adjacent open space or park areas are preferred
methods to achieve this requirement as encouraged as per the Draper City open
space conservation plan and the Draper City parks, trails, and recreation plan.
Examples of such areas are the Jordan River Parkway, Willow Creek, and Corner
Creek, but may include other locally important spaces, trails, and parks. The
minimum overall open space to qualify for this factor is twenty five percent
(25%) of the entire project area within the project area (road rights of way,
park strips, private trails, and private yards cannot be utilized in
calculating this percentage). One-half (1/2) of the overall provided open space
shall be considered "developable land", as defined within this chapter (minimum
20 percent of overall project acreage). Public trails which conform to the
locations shown on the Draper City master parks and trails plan, and related
public spur trails, can be counted for this requirement. Small gathering places
are also encouraged to be utilized and integrated throughout the project and
shall be open to the public whether maintained privately or publicly. All
public open space that meets this requirement does not necessarily constitute
acceptance of the open space for perpetual maintenance by Draper City.
No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the required overall PRD open space
shall be in the form of linear parks or trails.
b.   Preservation Of Natural Features: Preservation of natural features shall
include the preservation of drainages, washes and canals, significant stands of
native vegetation, significant trees or other topographic, scenic, natural, or
historical features, provided such features are left in their undisturbed
natural state. Plat or deed restrictions, maintenance agreements, conservation
easements, limits of disturbance, and other legal mechanisms shall be proposed
by the applicant as part of the evaluation consideration for this factor.
Limiting grading cuts and fills, redesigning streets, and redesigning floor
plans to work with topography can also assist in achieving natural feature
preservation. Attempting to receive or receiving a land disturbance permit or
grading permit prior to PRD approval shall negate the ability to achieve this
requirement, and accordingly, will render the entire application for a PRD moot
and is not allowed. PRD applications shall be eligible only for natural,
undisturbed project sites.
   Where indicated and approved within the overall PRD development plan,
existing site features may be remediated to become more natural, more
environmentally sensitive, or to increase biodiversity. Examples of this could
include: removal of noxious, exotic, or nonnative vegetation and replacement
with Utah native plants; reestablishment of biological riparian streambank
vegetation to aid in erosion control and natural channel enhancements; or
removal of hazardous soil or environmental contaminants and replacement with
Utah native soil or vegetation types. The construction of riprap, concrete
lined channels, or other manmade, engineering solutions to channel control is
not considered preservation of natural features. Methods utilizing biological
processes, native plants, bioengineering, and landscape architecture principles
shall be the preferred and required methods of mitigation, restoration, and
project design.
c.   Interior Amenities And Innovative Site Plan: Interior amenities shall mean
the provision of private recreational facilities such as tennis courts,
swimming pools, recreational centers, multiuse, nonmotorized paths and trails,
and private open spaces or parks which are accessible only to the residents
within the proposed development. In order to qualify for this requirement, the
entire project area must also be determined to be innovative in nature, which
requires a mix of lot sizes, dwelling units and ownership types, integration of
amenities and internal walking paths, wrought iron or similar increased quality
perimeter fencing and landscaping, enhanced landscaping, privately maintained
and architecturally designed entry features, high architectural standards and
design review processes, and an administrable plan to vary house design, sizes,
and heights.
3.   Increased Density Allowance: As a legislative action, determination of
increased overall project density shall be at the discretion of the city
council as part of the PRD overlay zone map amendment process, but shall be
subject to the following considerations:
a.   Prior to any determination of increased density, a project must first
establish base unit yield, as shown in total single- family residential units
for the overall project. To establish this base residential yield, the
applicant must include only developable area as defined in this subsection I,
and all yielded lots must meet all minimum requirements for the base zone and
all standard city minimum street right of way widths. The city shall verify the
accuracy of this base yield calculation as part of its initial PRD review.
b.   In order to qualify for any increased density at all, a PRD must
demonstrate substantially that all requirements in subsection I2 of this
section have been met to the satisfaction of the city.
c.   If all requirements in subsection I2 of this section have been met, a PRD
shall be eligible for an increased density allowance of up to twenty five
percent (25%) of the base residential yield. This yield shall be allocated
across the entire project in accordance with the standards found within this
chapter.
J.   Building Height:
1.   Building height shall not exceed thirty five feet (35'), as measured per
the adopted building code of Draper City. The planning commission and city
council may place additional height restrictions where necessary to preserve
views or to achieve compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood. Adding
fill on individual building pads to increase building height is not allowed.
2.   Buildings shall not exceed one story within fifty feet (50') of a single-
family district boundary line where:
a.   There exists on an adjacent lot a one-story residence; or
b.   There are zoning restrictions which limit adjacent undeveloped lots to
one-story residences.
K.   Perimeter Setback Requirements:
1.   Where a planned residential development (PRD) project abuts a single-
family development, the buildings on the PRD shall be set back from the
perimeter property line a distance at least as much as the required rear yard
or perimeter setback of the adjacent district. A landscape plan for this
required setback area shall be submitted.
2.   Where a planned residential development (PRD) project abuts a single-
family district where perimeter walls are specifically approved or required to
be set back from the common perimeter property line, perimeter walls on the PRD
development shall provide equal or greater setbacks.
L.   Findings Required: Before approval or modified approval of an application
for a proposed PRD overlay zone, the planning commission and city council must
find:
1.   That the development proposed is in substantial harmony with the general
plan of Draper City, and can be coordinated with existing and planned
development of surrounding areas.
2.   That the streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
serve the proposed uses and the anticipated traffic which will be generated.
3.   That the facts submitted with the application and presented at the hearing
will establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the planned residential
development will constitute a residential environment of sustained desirability
and stability; that it will be in harmony with the character of the surrounding
area; and that the sites proposed for public facilities such as schools,
playgrounds and parks, are adequate to serve the anticipated population.
4.   That the proposed development will result in a residential development
that is superior in quality and public benefit than a standard residential
development.
5.   That all required elements of providing public open space, preserving
natural features, and providing interior amenities and an innovative site plan,
have been met, in accordance with this chapter.
M.   Concept Plan Review Satisfied: Approval of a PRD zone and development plan
by the city council shall constitute approval of a subdivision concept plan, as
required by title 17 of this code. Preliminary and final plat approvals shall
follow standard city requirements. (Ord. 726, 2-6-2007)

9-11-080: (O-R) OFFICE/RESIDENTIAL:
A.   Purpose: A district composed of certain land and structures used primarily
to provide administrative, clerical, and professional offices, of a residential
scale and character, to serve nearby residential and commercial areas, as well
as the city as a whole. These uses are characterized by low volume, direct
daily customer contact. This district also provides for accessory medium-high
density residential (0 to 12 du/ac). This district is designed to be a
transitional zone, and should be used to buffer low density residential uses
from more intense land uses, districts, and heavily traveled transportation
routes. The property development standards, while strict in order to protect
adjacent low density residential uses, are designed to be flexible enough to
allow experimentation in office and housing design, and to allow housing
constructed within this district to incorporate its own protection from more
intense adjacent uses.
B.   Scope: The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any real property
located in an office residential zone as shown on the official zoning map. No
building, structure or real property shall be used and no building or structure
shall be erected, structurally or substantially altered, or enlarged except as
set forth in this chapter. Such requirements shall not be construed to prohibit
or limit other applicable provisions of this title, this code, or other laws.
C.   Use Regulations:
1.   Permitted Uses: Buildings, structures, or premises shall be used and
buildings and structures shall hereafter be erected, altered or enlarged only
for the following uses shown in section
9-11-110,
table 9-11-1 of this chapter:
2.   Residential uses shall be subordinate and secondary to commercial uses and
shall not occupy more than forty nine percent (49%) of the total site square
footage.
D.   Development Standards: The following property development standards shall
apply to all land and building in the O-R district:
1.   Open Space Requirements:
a.   Land uses that are density based (residential) shall provide a minimum of
thirty percent (30%) of the net lot area in open space.
b.   Land uses that are not density based shall provide a minimum of twenty
percent (20%) of the net lot area in open space.
c.   Open space required by subsections D1a and D1b of this section shall be
provided in the following proportions:
(1)   A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the net lot area shall be provided as
frontage open space to provide a setting for the building, visual continuity
within the community, and a variety of spaces in the streetscape, except that
the frontage open space shall not be required to exceed fifty (50) square feet
per one foot (1') of public street frontage excluding drives. Exception: Where
a lot has two (2) or more street frontages, there shall be no less than twenty
(20) square feet of open space per one foot (1') of street frontage for one
street and no less than ten (10) square feet of open space per one foot (1') of
street frontage excluding drives for other street(s).
(2)   A private outdoor living space shall be provided adjoining each dwelling
unit equal to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross size of the dwelling
unit, except that dwelling units above the first story shall provide such space
equal to a minimum of five percent (5%) of the gross size of the dwelling unit.
(3)   The remainder of the required open space shall be provided in common open
space.
2.   Minimum Property Size: No office-residential zoning shall be established
on any parcel less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet.
3.   Building Height: No building shall exceed twenty four feet (24') in
height.
4.   Density: The minimum gross land area per dwelling unit shall be three
thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet.
5.   Building Setback:
a.   Wherever an O-R development abuts an A5, A2, RA1, RA2, R3, RH, RM1 or RM2
district, a yard of not less than fifteen feet (15') shall be maintained,
except that accessory buildings for purposes of storage or carports may be
constructed to within twenty feet (20') of the adjacent district boundary line.
b.   Wherever an O-R development abuts any district other than A5, A2, RA1,
RA2, R3, RH, RM1 or RM2, a building may be constructed on the property line.
However, if any yard is to be maintained, it shall be not less than ten feet
(10') in depth. Larger yards may be required by the city council if the
existing or future development of the area around the site warrants such larger
yards.
c.   Where parking occurs between a building and the street, a yard of twenty
five feet (25') in depth shall be maintained. This depth may be decreased to a
minimum of fifteen feet (15') if the city council feels the existing or future
development of the area around the site warrants such action.
6.   Distance Between Buildings:
a.   There shall not be less than ten feet (10') between an accessory building
and a main building or between two (2) main buildings, except that an accessory
building with two (2) or more open sides, one of which is adjacent to the main
building, may be built to within six feet (6') of the main building.
7.   Walls, Fences And Required Screening:
a.   Walls, fences and hedges not to exceed eight feet (8') in height shall be
permitted on the property line of within the required yard areas, except within
the required frontage open space, within which they may not exceed three feet

approved by the City Council.
E.   Off Street Parking: The provisions of chapter 25 of this title shall
apply.
F.   Signs: The provisions of chapter 26 of this title shall apply.

7.   No more than fifty percent (50%) of a building's ground floor may be used
for parking and in no case shall under structure parking be adjacent to any
public or private right-of-way. Underground parking is strongly encouraged.
8.   Live/work units are not a permitted use within the TC Zone. A live/work
unit is defined as follows:
- Live/Work Unit: A building or space within a building used jointly for
commercial and residential purposes where the residential use of the space is
secondary or accessory to the primary use as a place of work.
D.   Standards: The following property development standards shall apply to all
land and buildings in the Town Center Zone:
1.   Site Requirements:
a.   Setbacks:
(1)   Front Setback: New buildings shall be built with a maximum setback of
fifteen feet (15') from any right-of-way, public or private. A maximum of forty
percent (40%) of the building's fascia may be located more than fifteen feet
(15') from the front property line in compliance with subsection E of this
section. Buildings being constructed on a parcel adjacent to a parcel
containing an existing building which meets the terms of the front setback
requirement of this zone, shall maintain a minimum of five feet (5') difference
in the setback, not to exceed fifteen feet (15') total.
(2)   Side Setback: Buildings to be located on a parcel shall maintain a
minimum ten foot (10') side setback requirement from an adjacent parcel
containing a residential use. Buildings shall have no side setback requirement
for any side yard adjacent to a parcel which is vacant or which contains a
commercial use. All buildings shall be required to fully comply with the terms
of the current edition of the adopted Building and Fire Codes of Draper City.
(3)   Rear Setback: Buildings shall have no rear setback requirement.
(4)   Corner Lots: Buildings to be located on a corner property shall maintain
front setback requirements as outlined in this section from each bordering
right-of-way and shall not be permitted to create a visual obstruction in
relation to vehicular traffic at, approaching, or leaving the intersection.

SETBACKS
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ce9e8f3cf5c3889a53df8d0578abb2568cc6f014/
IMAGES/0-0-0-48.jpg]
 
b.   Parking:
(1)   Parking Location: No parking shall be permitted between the building
facade and the front property line. All on site parking shall be contained to
the side and/or rear of the building. Parking located to the side of any
building shall be buffered from view from the street by extensive plantings and
landscaping with a horizontal separation from the street of at least ten feet
(10') from the property line or the depth of the building setback, whichever is
greater.
(2)   Parking Requirements: Parking shall be provided for all sites as outlined
in chapter 25 of this title.
(3)   Shared Parking: The following program is provided to permit reduced
parking requirements in the locations and situations outlined herein where the
basic parking requirements of this title would be excessive or detrimental to
goals and policies of the City relating to mass transit and other alternative
modes of transportation. This program to reduce parking requirements may be
applied individually or jointly to properties and developments. A record of
such reductions and the justification for their application shall be maintained
in the Community Development Department's project file.
(A)   Application: The Planning Commission may authorize a reduction in the
total number of required parking spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly
providing on site parking subject to the following criteria:
(i)   The respective hours of operation of the uses do not overlap, as
demonstrated by the application on
table 9-14-1, "Schedule Of Shared Parking Calculations", of this section. If
one or all of the land uses proposing to use joint parking facilities do not
conform to one of the general land use classifications, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data to indicate that there is not substantial conflict in
the principal operating hours of the uses. Such data may include information
from a professional publication, such as those published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), the Urban Land Institute (ULI), or by a
professionally prepared parking study.
(ii)   A parking plan shall be submitted for approval which shall show the
layout of proposed parking based on Draper City commercial site plan standards.
(B)   Calculation: Calculate the number of spaces required for each use if it
were freestanding (with no application of this program). Applying the
applicable general land use category to each proposed use, use the percentages
to calculate the number of spaces required for each time period, six (6) time
periods per use. Add the number of spaces required for all applicable land uses
to obtain a total parking requirement for each time period. Select the time
period with the highest total parking requirement and use that total as your
shared parking requirement.

c.   Site Access And Cross Access: Cross access between parking areas shall be
required. As a means to control the number of potential vehicular access points
from private property onto right-of-way, adjacent commercial sites may be
required to share accessways to parking facilities. Additionally, accessways to
a parking facility should be located at a side property line of a site where
shared access is or could be desirable or necessary. Sites which choose or are
required to share an accessway which is not located on the same site shall be
required to implement a landscaped pedestrian corridor from the front to the
rear of the site in a size equal to the width of the vehicular accessway.

IMAGES/0-0-0-50.jpg]
 
d.   Lighting: On site lighting shall conform to the provisions of chapter 20
of this title. Lighting should be designed so as to minimize the number of
poles used within the parking area with preferred methods being building
mounted lights or bollard type lighting. Pedestrian pathways should be
illuminated through the use of bollard lighting. A site lighting plan shall be
required for all sites within the TC Zone which demonstrates the photometric
layout throughout the property. All on site lighting shall be shielded and be
of a style and design that allows no light to shine beyond any site property
line. Lighting installed along right-of-way corridors shall conform to the
lighting style prescribed by the City for the corridor. Lighting, including
fixtures and poles, shall be designed to integrate architecturally with the
building and the Town Center area.
e.   Courtyards: Commercial sites within the TC Zone are encouraged to be
designed to incorporate plaza or courtyard areas which are designed to
encourage use of the area as a resting or relaxing place. Such areas shall be
allowed on all sides of a building. These areas are characterized as being well
landscaped areas which include benches, shade features, and certain other
amenities, such as water features or a pedestrian scale tower clock.

f.   Service Elements: All service elements, such as dumpsters and building
mechanical equipment, shall be screened through the use of landscaping or
incorporation into the building architecture. All enclosures for such features
shall be constructed of the same materials and of similar architecture as the
building. All such equipment shall be located away from residential uses on
neighboring properties and shall not be visible from any roadway. All ground
utility equipment shall be appropriately screened through the use of
landscaping which provides a visual barrier without prohibiting or restricting
access.

9-14-010: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE TSD ZONE:
A.   Purpose: The transit station district zone is established to promote
transit oriented and transit supportive development in areas that are generally
located near a commuter rail transit or rapid transit station and to maximize
the flexibility of the development approval process so as to permit such
development in a manner that is responsive to market demands and consistent
with the purposes and objectives of the TSD.
B.   Objectives: The TSD is intended to promote and provide incentives to
create a clustered, high density residential mixed use and pedestrian friendly
development with an effort to provide ready accessibility to freeway service as
well as a unique public transit service environment. This type of development
is generally referred to as TOD, or transit oriented development, and by
focusing development in proximity to transit stations, transit oriented
development can create interesting and successful urban centers, diminish urban
sprawl, and play a major role in realizing regional development strategies. The
objectives of the TSD are to:
1.   Permit and support higher development densities to encourage vertical
development, the utilization of mass transit, and alternative modes of
transportation other than the automobile;
2.   Reduce rates of vehicle miles traveled for both residents and workers in
the TSD;
3.   Allow for mixed land uses and greater development densities by encouraging
a flexible arrangement of residential, commercial and mixed use developments,
while adopting urban development standards to ensure compatibility between the
uses and pedestrian activity;
4.   Minimize distances between destinations by allowing for and promoting a
number of conveniences and uses that are compatible with one another and that
are generally within an approximate one-half (1/2) mile walking distance of
each other, such as home to office, home to retail service, home to education
or religious, and office to retail service;
5.   Promote pedestrian friendly design and architectural structuring that
encourages walking and bicycling, in accordance with the intent of the city's
master parks, recreation, and trails plan;
6.   Increase a variety of multi-family housing opportunities through the
lessening of transportation development and maintenance costs;
7.   Increase incentives for applicants to develop a TOD by encouraging less
money and land spent on parking and road installation and maintenance costs;
8.   Promote alternative methods of transportation and provide planning methods
that take into consideration those who cannot drive or afford an automobile as
well as those that choose not to;
9.   Create and enhance cultural use areas that promote neighborhood and local
social activities;
10.   Integrate public use spaces, plazas, courtyards and pocket parks and
encourage, where reasonably possible, the connection of these areas to other
uses in the TSD and existing public use space and recreational system in the
community of Draper City;
11.   Accommodate an economically viable development plan, recognizing that
such a development plan will likely benefit the city in the form of tax
increment, private investment and the creation of new jobs by the extension of
the rapid commuter rail line within Draper City;
12.   Allow for greater flexibility in street and road infrastructure design
and features that distinguish the area as unique, create a distinctive ambiance
to the development, promote a complete streets philosophy where autos,
bicycles, and pedestrians are considered equally important, and which reduce
maintenance costs through reduced parking and right-of-way widths;
13.   Create a transportation connection to the Bangerter Highway and I-15 from
the Draper City Commuter Rail Station;
14.   Provide for the mutual reinforcement of the Utah Transit Authority's
(UTA's) public investments and private development in and around transit
stations through public-private partnerships;
15.   Pursuant to the authority of Utah Code Annotated section 10-9a-102(2),
specifically authorize the execution of one or more project specific
development agreements and other ancillary agreements in connection with TSD
developments, which development and ancillary agreements may, among other
things, specify the obligations of the respective parties with respect to the
installation of required infrastructure improvements, reimbursement for system
improvements and oversizing, alternative approval and regulatory methods for
specific projects or such other matters as the City and the applicable project
applicant may agree; and
16.   Create a development that provides high quality architecture, design
standards, and building materials intended to promote long term sustainability.

ACTIVE PEDESTRIAN SPACE: An urban area that is designed predominantly for use
by pedestrians and bicycles, rather than automobiles. These spaces can be an
enhanced sidewalk, plaza, walking street, or woonerf. Active pedestrian spaces
are designed specifically to facilitate human interaction and are used for
gathering or transportation. These spaces allow people to walk or bike from
destination to destination.
AMENITY AREA: The area between the back of curb and the sidewalk/pedestrian
area where street trees and street furnishings are located. This area may be
vegetated, or may contain hard surface paving.
BUILD-TO LINE: The required distance between the back of curb and the building
facade. This metric represents a maximum setback, and normally specifies a
certain percentage of the facade which must meet the setback.
BUILDING HEIGHT: The vertical distance from grade plane to the average height
of the highest roof surface, where "grade plane" means a reference plane
representing the average of finished ground level adjoining the building at
exterior walls. Where the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior
walls, the reference plane shall be established by the lowest point within the
area between the building and the lot line or, where the lot line is more than
six feet (6') from the building, between the building at a point six feet (6')
from the building.
CITY: Draper City, Utah.
CURB CUT: An opening along the curb line at which point vehicles may enter or
leave the roadway.
CURB OR CURB LINE: The predominant back edge of a roadway of paved area,
excluding driveways, indentations and curb cuts.
DCCR STATION: Draper City Commuter Rail Station.
DU/AC: Dwelling units per acre. This abbreviation represents a way of measuring
residential density within a residential development. The number is a net
number of units per land area.
DEVELOPMENT: An application for a conditional use permit, site plan,
residential building permit, or residential subdivision. An application for a
zoning map or text amendment or commercial subdivision shall not be considered
development for the purpose of this chapter.
DRIVE-THROUGH: Facilities allowing transactions for goods or services without
leaving a motor vehicle.
FACADE: That portion of any exterior elevation of a building extending from
grade to top of parapet, wall or eaves and the entire width of the building
elevation, but excluding the roof.
JOINT USE PARKING STRUCTURE: A parking structure that is utilized by buildings
or tenants on two (2) or more parcels.
LINER FACED STRUCTURED PARKING: A parking structure that includes street facing
retail or commercial uses at the ground level.
MAP: Master area plan.
MASTER DEVELOPER: The owner of one or more parcels of ground within the TSD who
has entered into a development agreement with the city pursuant to which the
owner has been designated as the "master developer" and agreed to develop such
parcels in accordance with the requirements of the TSD. The master developer
shall continue to act as the master developer for such parcels as are governed
by the development agreement designating the master parcel notwithstanding the
sale of any particular parcel and the execution of a project specific
development agreement for such parcel.
PARK STRIP: The area between the back of curb and the sidewalk or pedestrian
area where street trees and street furnishings are located. This term
specifically refers to a vegetated area.
PARKING, OFF STREET: Marked or unmarked parking located within a development
parcel and outside a public or private right of way or street easement.
PARKING, ON STREET: Marked or unmarked parking located completely or partially
within a public or private right of way or street easement.
PEDESTRIAN AREA: An area between the amenity area or park strip and a private
development parcel. This area is normally part of the public right of way, and
includes a sidewalk for pedestrian passage.
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (Also Referred To As A PPP, Or A P3): Any type of
venture which is funded and operated through a partnership of a government
entity or entities and a private company or companies. The government entity
may be at the state, county, or city level.
PUBLIC USE SPACE: An area of land set aside, dedicated, designated or reserved
for public or private use for recreational or amenity activities, including,
but not limited to, parks, plazas and patios.
RIGHT OF WAY: The boundary of public ownership of a street or alley.
SETBACK: The required distance between the building line and the related front,
side or rear lot line over which no part of any building may extend, unless
otherwise provided. Setbacks may be specified as maximum or minimum distances.
SHARED PARKING: Parking that is utilized by two (2) or more tenants, with each
space counting toward minimum requirements for each use. Shared parking is a
tool used to reduce the overall amount of parking on a site, by allowing uses,
usually uses with different hours of patronage, to "double count" a parking
space toward minimum parking requirements. As an example, a parking space may
be shared by a transit station whose use is primarily weekday, daytime hours,
and a movie theater whose use has higher demand in evenings and on weekends,
but counted independently or, "double counted" toward the minimum requirements
of each use.
SIDEWALK: A paved surface intended for pedestrians located within a public or
private street right-of-way or street easement.
STEP BACK: A required change in the vertical plane of a building facade,
normally increasing the horizontal distance, above a certain number of floors,
between the front of the building and the street. Step backs are primarily used
to ensure light and air access to the street level, and to reduce the
perceptions of buildings "towering" over the street.
TOD: Transit oriented development.
TSD OR TSD ZONE: The Transit Station District land use designation and zoning
district, as described in this chapter.
WAYFINDING: The use of landmarks, signage, and other identifying site features
to guide pedestrian and vehicular traffic through an area. (Ord. 985, 10-13-
2011; amd. Ord. 1024, 8-21-2012)
9-14-030: ESTABLISHMENT OF TSD ZONING:
The Transit Station District is a zoning designation that shall serve as the
underlying zoning district. The boundaries of the TSD shall be identified on
the City's official zoning map. The regulations and provisions contained in
this chapter shall supersede any conflicting provisions in this Code. (Ord.
985, 10-13-2011)
9-14-040: INTENSITY AREAS AND STATION HUB:
A.   Intensity Areas: The TSD is composed of three (3) specific intensity
areas: TSD-1; TSD-2; and TSD-3. Density is expected to be highest in the TSD-
1 and TSD-2 intensity areas, which shall be pedestrian oriented and well
connected to public use spaces, parks, plazas and social gathering areas.
Similar connectivity and pedestrian orientation is encouraged for the TSD-
3 intensity area, but application of the foregoing requirements may not be as
strictly applied given the orientation, grade, or other site specific
constraints affecting the development of a particular parcel within the TSD-
3 intensity area. Multiple uses consisting primarily of multi-family,
commercial, retail, office, and a mix of the foregoing and other uses are
particularly encouraged in the TSD-1 and TSD-2 intensity areas. The boundaries
of the TSD-1, TSD-2, and TSD-3 intensity areas shall be as shown in section
9-14-110, exhibit 9-14-1 of this chapter, and may be adjusted from time to time
as a text amendment to this chapter, pursuant to section
9-5-060 of this title. The official copies of all approved MAPs and intensity
area boundaries shall be maintained in and by the Draper City Community
Development Department.
B.   Transit Station Hub: A large multitransit station hub may be located
within the DCCR station area. The DCCR station and anticipated multitransit hub
is intended to serve the commercial workforce in and around the City. Transit
riders served by a DCCR station will primarily be going to, or coming from
work. It will be necessary to serve the area with improved vehicular access and
pedestrian network systems for safe walking, and it will be vital for the DCCR
station to accommodate a park and ride lot and bus station. It may also benefit
some of the large businesses in the area to serve their transit riders with
shuttles. (Ord. 985, 10-13-2011)
9-14-050: USE REGULATIONS:
A.   Permitted And Conditional Uses: The land uses allowed in the TSD shall be
as set forth in
table 9-14-1 of this section. Permitted and conditional uses are indicated by a
"P" or "C", respectively, in the appropriate column. Uses not permitted are
indicated by "NP". Any permitted or conditional use not shown on
table 9-14-1 of this section shall be prohibited unless the Zoning
Administrator determines the use is substantially the same as a permitted or
conditional use. Uses identified as "conditional" are to be approved by the
Planning Commission pursuant to the standards and procedures for conditional
uses set forth in section
9-5-080 of this title, and shall comply with all other applicable requirements
of this chapter.
B.   Accessory Uses: The permitted and conditional uses set forth in
table 9-14-1 of this section shall be deemed to include accessory uses and
activities that are necessarily and customarily associated with and incidental
and subordinate to such uses.
C.   Temporary Uses: Any person may sponsor or conduct for profit or nonprofit
purposes the temporary uses set forth in this section, subject to the issuance
of a temporary use permit in accordance with the standards found within
title 6, chapter 16 of this Code, unless under express provision of this
chapter no such permit is required:
Auction;

9-14-060: MASTER AREA PLAN:
A.   Intent: The intent of the master area plan (MAP) and the process for
submitting and obtaining approval of such MAP is to provide an applicant of
large or phased projects (MAP area) with a mechanism to obtain the City's
approval of a conceptual framework for such projects within the TSD. Public use
spaces, proposed land uses, and specific design and development standards
within the MAP area shall be identified and a conceptual plan describing those
elements of the MAP area shall be part of the MAP. An approved MAP constitutes
approval of a master plan that will guide future development within the MAP
area.
B.   MAP Required: A MAP shall be required in connection with the development
of any property within the TSD. A MAP may be submitted for approval with
respect to one or more parcels or any combination of parcels within the TSD.
Prior to submission of a proposed MAP to the City, an applicant shall submit
the same to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) for review, which review,
when completed, shall be set forth in a written instrument provided to the city
by the ACC. The ACC shall review and evaluate a proposed MAP for conformity
with the requirements of this chapter and any applicable development standards
and design guidelines. Except as expressly provided above or unless
specifically approved by the ACC in writing, no development shall be approved
by the city unless such development pertains to land included within a MAP area
for which a MAP has been approved. A MAP may establish site specific
development standards and regulations that deviate from development standards
contained in other chapters of the development code for the purposes of
achieving the objectives of this chapter.
C.   MAP Requirements:
1.   Narrative: Each MAP shall include a narrative providing the following:
a.   Names, addresses and phone numbers of the applicant and owners of the
project;
b.   A letter confirming review of the proposed MAP by the ACC;
c.   A general description of proposed land uses, parking plan and public use
space elements to be included in the MAP area;
d.   A general description of the transportation systems within the MAP area,
whether existing or proposed, including collector and arterial streets, and a
general description of the proposed plan for accommodating auto, bicycle and
pedestrian circulation and connectivity, and parking, along with the
utilization and accommodation of any existing or proposed public transit
connections within the MAP area or located on adjoining properties;
e.   A general description of major stormwater drainage and other utility
systems anticipated to be required in connection with the development of the
MAP area, including, where applicable, the proposed or likely service providers
for such utility services;
f.   Contemplated development guidelines, architectural and site design
standards for the MAP area, including setback standards for any TSD-3 intensity
area, and any proposed development standards for the periphery of the MAP area
designed to promote compatibility between the MAP area and adjoining
properties, and, if applicable, a description of how structured parking will be
architecturally integrated into the development, which is required when
structured parking is proposed;
g.   A general description of the estimated sequence and timing of development
of the MAP area, including the proposed phasing of public use space and any
major on site or off site infrastructure improvements or facilities required or
anticipated to be required in connection with the development of the MAP area;
h.   A comprehensive sign program, which program shall establish the allowed
types of signs and their permitted sizes and locations, and which may be
submitted as part of the initial MAP application or pursuant to a supplement or
amendment thereto;
i.   An economic analysis proving that there is sufficient commercial product
in any TSD-1 or TSD-2 intensity area to produce revenue positive results to the
city;
j.   A land use analysis identifying acceptable ratios of uses outlined in
section
9-14-050,
table 9-14-1 of this chapter; and
2.   Graphics: Each MAP shall include the following graphic submittals:
a.   A conceptual drawing identifying the general location of the proposed land
uses by area and indicating the anticipated range of residential and commercial
densities, where applicable, within the MAP area;
b.   A conceptual drawing identifying the general location of any arterial and
collector roadways, bicycle networks, and central or loop trail system and
trailheads planned for the MAP area;
c.   A conceptual drawing identifying the general location of any neighborhood
parks or other major public use space areas proposed for the MAP area; and
d.   Maps and legal description of the boundaries of the applicable MAP areas,
and any proposed adjustment to the approved boundaries of the TSD-1, TSD-2, and
TSD-3 intensity areas. Any proposed adjustment to approved intensity area
boundaries shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to subsection
9-14-040A of this chapter.
3.   Additional Submittal Options:
a.   Parking Reduction: An applicant may request a reduction of parking
requirements otherwise set forth in this chapter pursuant to a MAP application,
which request shall address the justifications for or design features
supporting the requested reduction through a professionally prepared parking
study.
b.   Transportation Facilities And Infrastructure: If the applicant wishes to
have specific approval of transportation facilities and infrastructure the
details of which are not generally required pursuant to the MAP requirements,
the applicant may request such approval provided the applicant submits studies
supporting the specific facilities or infrastructure and identifies such
facilities and infrastructure in reasonable detail in connection with its MAP
application. An overall streetscape master plan may also be developed as part
of the MAP application.
c.   Stormwater, Water Quality And Drainage: If the applicant desires to
utilize a stormwater collection system that aggregates stormwater from multiple
parcels in the MAP area, the applicant shall submit a comprehensive stormwater
plan in connection with its MAP application.
4.   Waiver Of Specific Submissions: Any information required for MAP submittal
may be waived by the city, on the basis that the information is not applicable
to the proposed uses being reviewed within the proposed MAP. Such waivers shall
be documented in writing by the zoning administrator prior to the planning
commission review of the MAP for the waiver to take effect.
D.   Review Process: Submittals for MAP approval shall follow the following
process:
1.   Planning Commission Review: Within forty five (45) days of receiving all
required submissions relating to a MAP, the planning commission shall hold a
public hearing on any MAP proposed pursuant to this section and shall recommend
approval or denial to the city council within twenty one (21) days of the
public hearing. The applicant may opt to waive the strict application of this
time line if additional time is necessary to address or negotiate specific
issues with the city prior to the development of a formal staff recommendation
to the planning commission.
2.   City Council Review: After receiving the recommendation from the planning
commission with respect to a MAP, the city council shall hold a public hearing
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the recommendation. The city council
shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the MAP within twenty one (21)
days of the public hearing. The decision of the city council to approve or deny
a MAP shall be deemed a final decision entitling the applicant to appeal the
decision to a district court as set forth in Utah Code Annotated section 10-9a-
801, or its successor section.
3.   Noticing: Review of an application for approval for or amendment to a MAP,
as described in this subsection, shall be noticed to the public by way of
mailing written notice to neighboring property owners based on information
provided by the applicant as called for in subsection
9-5-045A of this title, posting of public hearing signs on the property as
called for and determined in subsection
9-5-045C of this title, and posting of a notice of public hearing on the Utah
public notice website. All such noticing shall be done at least ten (10)
calendar days prior to each public hearing.
E.   Criteria For Review: The planning commission and city council shall have
discretion to disapprove a MAP with respect to the required elements of a MAP
application only on the basis of: 1) the failure to provide and comply with all
of the required elements under this section unless waived pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter; 2) the failure of the master circulation plan to
adequately serve the MAP area and areas surrounding the project; 3) the failure
of any item required by this section to provide for a community character
substantially consistent with the purposes of the TSD, including the failure of
the land use analysis to provide for at least twenty five percent (25%)
commercial, retail, or office uses; or 4) development standards or design
guidelines that are inconsistent with high quality transit oriented design
standards, including the use of high quality building materials.
F.   Recording: All approved MAPs, and all approved amendments to such MAPs,
shall be recorded in the real property records with a notation that all land
within such boundaries shall be subject to the provisions of such MAP or
amendment unless or until amended.
G.   Major And Minor Amendments: Provided the written review of the ACC has
been previously obtained and submitted to the city, including ACC review of a
site plan or site plan amendment, an approved MAP may be amended at any time
and such amendment may occur simultaneously with the processing of a site plan
application or a site plan amendment. The Zoning Administrator shall decide
whether a proposed amendment is a "major" or "minor" amendment. A major
amendment shall be reviewed and approved or denied using the process
established for the initial MAP approval. A minor amendment shall be reviewed
and approved or denied by the Zoning Administrator. In order to initiate an
amendment, the applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator those MAP
submission items that would change if the proposed amendment were approved.
Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision regarding a MAP amendment shall
be to the City Council.
1.   Major Amendments: Changes of the following types shall define an amendment
as major:
a.   Those which materially modify or reallocate the allowable height, mix of
uses, or density of a development;
b.   Those which materially alter the location or amount of land dedicated to
parks, trails, public use space, natural areas or public facilities; or
c.   Those which modify any other aspect of the MAP that would significantly
change its character.
2.   Minor Amendments: Amendments that are not major amendments shall be termed
"minor amendments" and shall include incremental dimensional changes, minor
changes in locations of uses, and similar changes that do not qualify as a
major amendment. The Zoning Administrator may also refer the application to
other departments or agencies for comment.
H.   Effect Of Approved MAPs:
1.   Legislative Determination: Approval of a MAP shall constitute a
legislative determination that the MAP is consistent with the TSD Zone.
2.   Binding: All MAPs and MAP amendments recorded pursuant to this chapter
shall be binding upon the City and the applicants and their respective
successors and assigns with respect to the development of property within the
MAP area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the implementation of any phasing plan
included in the MAP is to be used for strategic timing only and shall not be
binding upon the applicant or any successor of the applicant.
3.   Period Of Force: A recorded MAP shall be in full force and effect until
such time as the MAP is amended, replaced by a new MAP for the same location,
or terminated pursuant to a written agreement between the applicant or the
applicant's successor in interest with respect to the applicable portion of the
MAP area and the City.
4.   Vested Property Rights: An approved MAP shall constitute a site specific
development plan which triggers a vested property right in favor of the
applicant or subsequent owner of the property included in the MAP area. Such
vested property right shall remain vested for the duration of the MAP. The
applicant's or subsequent owner's vested rights are directly proportional to
the level of detail approved in the MAP. (Ord. 985, 10-13-2011)
9-14-070: ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL COMMITTEE:
An Architectural Control Committee (ACC) shall be appointed by the master
developer and shall have the opportunity to review all MAP and development
proposals for compliance with the requirements of this chapter and any
applicable development standards and design guidelines prior to submission of
those proposals to the City for review. The ACC shall provide to the City a
written report of all applications reviewed for which application will be made
to the City. Reports for proposed site plan applications shall address all of
the review criteria listed in subsection
9-14-090D of this chapter. The ACC shall have up to thirty (30) days from the
date of receipt of an application in which to complete its review and submit
its report to the City. Following receipt of that report, or the expiration of
the thirty (30) day review period, the City may review and approve the MAP or
other development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. In the
event that the master developer no longer is the owner of record of any parcels
within the TSD, the City shall designate another party to appoint and
coordinate an ACC provided that any such party so designated is an owner of
record of a commercial parcel within the TSD. (Ord. 985, 10-13-2011)
9-14-080: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND URBAN DESIGN REGULATIONS:
A.   Density: Consistent with the goals and objectives of the TSD, there shall
be no maximum residential density or nonresidential intensity in the TSD. The
following minimum residential densities are required in those portions of a TSD
intensity area where residential uses are proposed to be built:
TSD-1: Thirty five (35) du/ac.
TSD-2: Fifteen (15) du/ac.
TSD-3: Five (5) du/ac.
B.   Required Buffer: An average two hundred foot (200') wide, with a minimum
one hundred foot (100') wide, recreational or public use space buffer is
required immediately south of and adjacent to the existing Galena Hills
Subdivision. There shall be no buffer required east of the west right-of-way
boundary of Galena Park Boulevard, as shown in section
9-14-110, exhibit 9-14-1 of this chapter. This buffer shall be extensively
landscaped and extend the length of the existing single-family residential
development, and is meant to assist in transitioning from the smaller scale of
the existing residential development to the taller, denser development of the
TSD. Public infrastructure, including roadways and related improvements may be
located within the required buffer area only for the purpose of providing
connectivity to existing or proposed street rights-of-way. The provision of
this connectivity may be for permanent or temporary connections to the existing
or realigned Galena Hills Boulevard right-of-way and shall be provided in a
manner that the street connection within the buffer area is minimized to the
greatest extent possible for the most reasonable alignment. With the exception
of the connection to the existing or realigned Galena Hills Boulevard, there
shall be no streets or roadways allowed within the buffer area. Those portions
of residential or commercial buildings that are located within the area that is
within fifty feet (50') of the required buffer shall be limited to a maximum of
thirty six feet (36') in height.
C.   Building Height: Massing and shadow studies will be required as part of
site plan approval, and can be used as justification to modify the maximum or
minimum heights allowed. Consistent with the goals and objectives of the TSD,
there shall be no maximum building height in the TSD. Unoccupied accessory
buildings shall have no minimum height requirement. The following minimum
heights are required, unless minimum height standards are modified as part of
the MAP, site plan approval process, or in order to comply with the buffer
requirements of subsection B of this section:
TSD-1: Forty five feet (45').
TSD-2: Thirty six feet (36').
TSD-3: No minimum.
(Ord. 985, 10-13-2011)
D.   Building Orientation And Entrances:
1.   The front facade of all principal buildings in the TSD-1 and TSD-
2 intensity areas shall face onto the street or an active pedestrian space, and
not be oriented toward a parking lot or parking structure.
2.   Pedestrian connections shall be provided between the sidewalk and each
primary building entry in the TSD-1 and TSD-2 intensity areas. (Ord. 985, 10-
13-2011; amd. Ord. 1024, 8-21-2012)
E.   Roadway Network And Street Guidelines:
1.   The street network shall be compact and connected, promoting efficient
pedestrian and vehicular travel. Streets shall be designed to minimize modal
conflict between pedestrians, cyclists and automobiles.
2.   Where possible considering the applicable land uses, the street network
shall create small blocks, in order to promote walking and a positive
pedestrian environment.
3.   The street network shall use appropriately sized, not overly wide street
cross sections. In this regard, existing City standards may be modified to
accommodate a smaller street width to facilitate a walkable community. These
cross sections shall include a pedestrian area consisting of a sidewalk and
amenity area, on street parking, and travel lanes. On street bike lanes shall
be included, as appropriate. Typical cross sections for streets and alleys
within the TSD are set forth in section
9-14-110 of this chapter. Final street cross sections shall be approved in
connection with the applicable MAP.
4.   All streets developed and maintained within the TSD shall be constructed
in accordance with structural pavement section standards generally applicable
to similarly sized streets in the City. Alternate or decorative paving
treatments, such as unit pavers or decorative concrete may be proposed by the
applicant and approved by the City staff.
5.   Alleys shall be privately owned.
6.   The adjacent property owner will be required to maintain the 22.5 foot
section of right-of-way, and maintenance duties will remain until such time as
City expands the roadway to full buildout. At full buildout the maintenance of
the park strip will continue to be the responsibility of the adjacent property
owner. (Ord. 1263, 6-6-2017)
F.   Vehicular Access:
1.   Alleys shall be encouraged as the standard, primary access for all
nonresidential uses within the TSD-1 and TSD-2 intensity areas, including
primary access to garages, service functions, and trash storage and collection.
2.   Within the TSD-1 and TSD-2 intensity areas, curb cuts shall be prohibited,
except for alleys, unless no other acceptable access is available to the
particular site. On a block facing multiple rights of way, curb cuts may be
allowed on the less traveled street. In cases where curb cuts are provided, the
vehicular pathway shall be of sufficient depth so that a delivery vehicle does
not obstruct the pedestrian sidewalk.
G.   Sidewalks And Pedestrian Circulation: Convenient pedestrian circulation
systems shall be provided to minimize pedestrian-auto conflicts. Pedestrian
walkways shall connect building entrances to each other and connect building
entrances, sidewalks and public streets to existing or planned transit stops.
Sidewalks shall be at least eight feet (8') wide in the TSD-1 intensity area.
In the TSD-2 and TSD-3 intensity areas, the sidewalk shall not be less than
five feet (5') wide.
H.   Streetscape And Landscape Requirements: Streetscape and landscape within
and visible from the public rights of way shall be designed to facilitate
pedestrian wayfinding and to create an attractive, pedestrian scaled
environment. Plant materials shall be selected for their appropriateness to the
northern Utah environment and for visual appeal. Tree species which are deemed
shade or canopy trees are preferred to smaller ornamental varieties.
I.   Parking Requirements:
1.   Parking Required: The number of parking stalls required shall be
calculated pursuant to the requirements of chapter 25 of this title as modified
according to the terms of this chapter unless alternative requirements are
established pursuant to an approved MAP. The location and type of parking
stalls required shall be provided according to the following:
a.   Within the TSD-1 intensity area, parking shall be provided as on street
parking, where the road cross section can accommodate such parking and is
specifically approved as part of a MAP, or within a parking structure with ADA
accessible and delivery parking only being allowed as off street surface
parking;
b.   Within the TSD-2 intensity area, parking shall be provided as on street
parking, where the road cross section can accommodate such parking and is
specifically approved as part of a MAP, within a parking structure, or as off
street surface parking with a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of the total
parking requirement being allowed as off street surface parking; and
c.   Within the TSD-3 intensity area, on street and off street, surface parking
for nonresidential uses shall be permitted when approved as a part of a MAP.
2.   Structured Parking Not Required: Structured parking described in
subsections I1a and I1b of this section shall not be required where public
financing or funding is not available or offered to construct sufficient
structured parking to meet the requirements of this chapter. When structured
parking is not required, off street surface parking in the TSD-1 and TSD-
2 intensity areas shall be provided and shall include at least the following
design features, to be addressed specifically and approved with the MAP
including the subject properties:
a.   Eight foot (8') wide pedestrian pathways shall be provided, spaced no more
than one hundred fifty feet (150') apart, through all parking areas and shall
include landscaping and vegetative plantings on each side;
b.   Plaza areas at the primary entrance to all buildings from the parking
area;
c.   Pedestrian walkways connecting all building entrances to street right of
way sidewalks;
d.   Extensive pedestrian pathway system that connects all buildings to all on
site parking areas, all other buildings within the same MAP area, and paths
leading directly to the DCCR station;
e.   Landscaping and planting beyond that anticipated for site plans approved
according to the provisions of chapter 23 of this title; and
f.   All on site surface parking area shall be located to the interior of the
site and to the rear of all primary buildings.
3.   Required Parking; Reductions: To encourage transit oriented development
throughout the TSD, minimum parking requirements shall be reduced twenty five
percent (25%) from those otherwise required for such land use pursuant to the
development code. A further reduction up to an additional twenty five percent
(25%) may be requested based on the inclusion of transit supportive features
within the site design as part of the site plan approval process and based on a
professionally prepared parking study. These features include, but are not
limited to, the following:
a.   Shared parking as shown by a legally executed agreement between multiple
entities;
b.   Formation of a parking district, and construction of joint use parking
reservoir structures;
c.   Shared access points for adjacent parking lots;
d.   Provision of shuttle service, outside the one-fourth (1/4) mile radius to
the DCCR station, connecting to the DCCR station; and
e.   Provision of motorcycle and bicycle specific spaces.
4.   Large And Phased Developments:
a.   Parking minimums must be met at every phase of development.
b.   Temporary parking on parcels slated for later phase development shall be
allowed, but must be clearly marked as such on official site plans.
5.   Parking Dimensions: Off street parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine
feet (9') wide by eighteen feet (18') deep. Tandem parking spaces and other
measures to maximize parking efficiency and reduce the overall parking
footprint shall also be permitted.
J.   Public Use Space Requirements:
1.   The TSD shall include at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total
development area for public use space purposes, calculated on a per acre basis.
For purposes of this requirement, public use space shall include parks, trails,
plazas, courtyards, or other outdoor amenities and public spaces, including
hard surfaced areas conducive to enjoyment of the outdoors in an urban setting.
Street pavement, curb and gutter, park strip, and standard sidewalk, i.e., five
feet (5') or less in width, shall not be considered public use space. For
purposes of the determining public use spaces, sidewalks or walkways of at
least ten feet (10') in width which are designed and constructed as a part of
the city's trail system may be counted and included as public use space.
2.   Provided the mechanism for allocating or distributing the public use space
is set forth in an approved MAP, the fifteen percent (15%) public use space may
be calculated on an aggregated basis across multiple phases and/or across
multiple parcels within the TSD. In such circumstances, individual site plans
or project specific MAPs may be approved without including on site public use
space, pursuant to an approved MAP public space strategy.
3.   Applicants of individual sites or phases may choose to make a onetime cash
in lieu payment to the master developer to be used for the creation of public
use space within the TSD.
4.   Except as may be otherwise specified in an approved MAP, for large and
phased developments, fifty percent (50%) of the required public use space area
shall be complete when fifty percent (50%) of the total MAP land area has been
developed. One hundred percent (100%) of public use space shall be complete
when one hundred percent (100%) of the total MAP land area has been developed.
These public use space completion requirements may be waived by the city
depending on the distribution and location of individual components within the
overall public use space system, as detailed in an approved MAP.
K.   Lighting Standards:
1.   Lighting shall be provided within the public right of way along all
streets and alleys.
2.   All lighting fixtures shall be full cutoff, dark skies compliant, and
shall meet the requirements of chapter 20 of this title.

2.   Signs shall be made of high quality, durable materials to a level of
design and finish appropriate to the building/location where they are
installed.
3.   Signage affixed to the upper floor face of buildings shall be allowed but
will require review by the ACC.
4.   Specific signage standards for a MAP area shall be approved in connection
with the applicable MAP, and it is specifically contemplated that such signage
standards shall deviate from existing signage standards in the City. (Ord. 985,
10-13-2011; amd. Ord. 1024, 8-21-2012)

9-16-030: Procedure
9-16-040: Development Requirements
9-16-050: Development Standards
9-16-010: PURPOSE:
The city deems it important to the peace, health, safety and welfare of the
inhabitants of the city that land within hillside sensitive land overlay zones
be protected to ensure that urban development be guided in a manner that will
minimize the potential for flooding, erosion, and other natural hazards and
will protect natural scenic beauty. The objectives to be achieved by the use of
the hillside sensitive lands overlay zone shall include:
A.   Preservation of natural vegetation, geologic features, wildlife habitat
and open space;
B.   Minimizing the amount of grading and earthwork, including street
excavation and site grading;
C.   Retaining trees and other native vegetation, except in those cases where a
high fire hazard results, which stabilizes steep hillsides, retains moisture,
prevents erosion and enhances the beauty of the natural landscape;
D.   Designing and constructing roads, where necessary, in such a way as to
minimize scars from cuts and fills and to avoid permanent scarring of hillsides
and other sensitive land areas, and to make them easily accessible for fire
protection, snow removal, school buses, and emergency vehicles;
E.   Placing building sites to permit ample room for landscaping, surface
drainage, parking, and sewer serviceability;
F.   Grading which will eliminate sharp angles at the top and at the toe of cut
and fill slopes, both with respect to building sites and to road cross
sections;
G.   Creating street rights of way, grades, lot layouts and structure designs
which will aid the objective of reducing excavation and natural topographic
disturbance;
H.   Allowing cluster type development or similar concepts that will minimize
disturbance of steep or sensitive terrain;
I.   Authorizing early temporary or permanent planting, or both, wherever
appropriate to maintain necessary cut and fill slopes, stabilizing them by
plant roots and concealing the raw soil from view; and
J.   Protecting view corridors. (Ord. 1009, 9-4-2012)
9-16-020: SCOPE:
A.   Application: The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to all
lands located within the hillside sensitive lands overlay zone as delineated on
the official zoning map.
B.   Conflicting Provisions: In the event of conflict between this chapter and
other provisions of this code, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
C.   Preliminary Activities: The following requirements shall govern any
preliminary surveying, testing, or design related activities conducted within
the hillside sensitive lands overlay zone for the purpose of exploring,
evaluating and/or establishing locations for any permanent improvements.
Preliminary activities associated with the investigation of geologic hazards
shall also be subject to the requirements of section

(Ord. 1009, 9-4-2012)
9-16-040: DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
A.   Development In General: Slope areas in excess of thirty percent (30%) may
not be developed, and no more than thirty percent (30%) of a development's
slope areas in excess of thirty percent (30%) may be included in the area
calculation to determine density. The planning commission may modify this
requirement upon finding that:
1.   No significant harm will result;
2.   The proposed modification will result in a more functional and improved
plan; and
3.   The developer/builder agrees to comply with any conditions or requirements
imposed by the planning commission to mitigate any adverse effects which may
result from the proposed modification.
B.   Subdivision, Single-Family Lots: Except as provided in subsection A of
this section, the minimum lot size and yard requirements of the underlying zone
shall apply except that every lot shall have at least three thousand five
hundred (3,500) square feet of buildable area. The buildable area is the area
where the slope is thirty percent (30%) or less, and shall be completely
contiguous and have a minimum dimension of fifty feet (50'). Lots shall allow
dwelling units to be located within two hundred fifty feet (250') from a public
street. All main and accessory buildings shall be built within the buildable
area.
C.   Density Limitations: Except as provided in subsection A of this section,
the density limitations of the underlying zone shall apply except that all
buildings shall be built upon the buildable area.
D.   Maximum Impervious Material Coverage: The total maximum allowable coverage
by impervious material within a project or portion of a project within the
sensitive lands overlay zone shall not exceed thirty five percent (35%) of the
total project area. Areas of roofs and driveways will be estimated and included
in the total impervious surface area.
1.   The planning commission may allow commercial, institutional or multi-
family residential projects to exceed the thirty five percent (35%) impervious
coverage limitation, based upon the recommendations of the city engineer and
community development director, and adherence to the following criteria:
a.   The proposed project demonstrates that it does not create an adverse
drainage, erosion control, or other natural hazard;
b.   The proposed project meets the city's landscaping requirements for
commercial, institutional, and/or multi-family projects or development;
c.   The proposed project meets all other requirements of the sensitive lands
overlay zone and land disturbance ordinances (title 18 of this code). (Ord.
1009, 9-4-2012)
9-16-050: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A.   Intent: It is intended by this chapter that the development standards and
provisions, as set forth in this code, shall be required in connection with all
building and construction in the hillside sensitive lands overlay zone.
B.   Grading Drainage And Erosion: The area of the watershed shall be used to
determine the amount of stormwater runoff generated before and after
construction.
1.   The developer is responsible for interim stabilization of all disturbed
areas during the period of construction to prevent erosion off site effects,
and for final stabilization once construction is completed.
2.   Existing drainage channels shall remain as historically located except
that roads and utilities may be installed across such channels as approved by
the planning commission or the city council. Where these channel modifications
are planned, the developer shall obtain applicable Utah division of water
rights and U.S. army corps of engineers permits. The developer shall provide
evidence of such applications to the city. Structures and/or lots shall be
arranged so as to ensure adequate setbacks from all drainage channels. The 100-
year storm shall be that basis for calculating setbacks.
3.   Facilities for the collection of stormwater runoff shall be required to be
constructed on development sites and:
a.   Shall be the first improvements or facilities constructed on the
development site;
b.   Shall be designed so as to detain safely and adequately the maximum
expected stormwater runoff for a 10-year storm. A maximum stormwater controlled
release rate of 0.1 cubic feet per second per acre shall be the maximum
permitted discharge in the Salt Lake County portion of Draper City. A maximum
stormwater controlled release rate of 0.03 cubic feet per second per acre for a
10-year event and 0.06 cubic feet per second per acre for a 100-year event
shall be the maximum discharge rates permitted in the Utah County portion of
Draper City. However, no discharge shall exceed demonstrated historical flows
from any drainage or sum of drainages. Further reductions in release rates may
be required in situations of insufficient stormwater system capacity;
c.   Shall be so designed as to divert surface water away from cut faces or
sloping surfaces of a fill;
d.   Utilize the existing natural drainage system to the extent possible in its
unimproved state;
e.   Where drainage channels are required, use wide shallow swales lined with
appropriate vegetation, rock, or other approved material instead of cutting
narrow, deep drainage ditches;
f.   Use flow retarding devices, such as detention ponds, check dams, and
recharge berms where practical to minimize increases in runoff volume and peak
flow rate due to development;
g.   Include a hydrology map showing tributary areas for predevelopment, during
construction, and postdevelopment; and
h.   Shall not allow detention or retention basins to be constructed on an
identified geologic hazard.
4.   Construction on a development site shall minimize the disturbance of
vegetation cover.
5.   Erosion control measures on a development site shall minimize increased
suspended solids loading in runoff from such areas. A drainage design system to
control stormwater erosion during and after construction shall be contained in
a detailed grading and drainage report submitted by the developer.
6.   A description of any hydrologic hazards associated with the proposed
development site and adjacent area shall be required. Hydrologic hazards may
include high water table, surface water impoundments, gradient of the property,
and floodplains.
C.   Cut And Fill Slopes:
1.   Cut and fill slopes shall be provided in accordance with chapter 19 of
this title, slope stability ordinance, and title 18, "Land Disturbance", of
this code.
2.   Roadway cut and fill slopes located outside the dedicated public right of
way shall be located within recorded easements providing for slope protection
and preservation. The easements shall be in a form acceptable to the city.
D.   Earthwork:
1.   All surface areas to receive fill shall be stripped of any surface
vegetation, topsoil, and organics and cleared of any trash and debris that may
be present at the time of construction.
2.   After the site has been cleared and stripped, the exposed subgrade soils
in those areas to receive fill shall be scarified to a depth of eight inches
(8"), moisture conditioned and compacted to the compaction requirements of the
city standards and specifications.
E.   Setbacks: The setbacks and other restrictions specified by this subsection
are minimum requirements and may be increased by the city if necessary for
safety and stability, to prevent damage of adjacent properties from deposition
or erosion, or to provide access for slope maintenance and drainage. Setbacks
deal with distances from property lines, structures or faults, and must satisfy
requirements of the following subsections. Retaining walls may be used to
reduce the required setbacks when approved by the city:
1.   Setbacks from property lines shall comply with the current building codes
adopted by the city.
2.   Setbacks between graded slopes, cuts or fills, and structures shall comply
with the current building codes adopted by the city.
3.   No structure shall be located over a fault. Determinations of the
appropriate setback distance from the fault shall be made using the data
obtained in the geological report by the person or firm who prepared the
geological report, but in no case shall this distance be less than ten feet
(10').
F.   Vegetation And Revegetation:
1.   All areas of development sites cleared of natural vegetation in the course
of construction of off site improvements shall be replanted with vegetation
which has good erosion control characteristics.
2.   New plantings shall be protected with mulch material and fertilized when
in conjunction with planting and watering schedule.
3.   Persons or firms having expertise in the practice of revegetation, such as
a licensed landscape architect or nurseryman, shall supervise the planning and
installation of revegetation cover for the total development site.
4.   Vegetation shall be removed only when absolutely necessary, e.g., for the
construction of buildings, roads and filled areas, as approved by the city
engineer.
5.   Where permanent roads or roadbeds are to be used during construction and
stormwater inlets have already been installed, they shall be protected to
prevent sediment laden water entering the storm sewer system.
G.   Geology:
1.   No structures shall be built on or within ten feet (10') of any identified
faults.
2.   No structures or improvements shall be allowed on any area known to be
within an active landslide area.
3.   Problems associated with development on or near perched groundwater and
shallow groundwater shall be mitigated.
4.   No structures shall be allowed in any rockfall zone.
H.   Fire Protection:
1.   Footing and foundation permits shall not be issued until work on the water
system has commenced. A full building permit shall be issued only when the
water system is completed and operational to provide fire protection.
2.   Each development site proposal and building permit application shall be
reviewed by the fire department to determine whether it complies with the
current International Fire Code. Developments which do not comply shall be
disapproved.
3.   Restrictive covenants for a development in the hillside sensitive lands
overlay zone shall not require the use of wood shake shingles or wood exterior
siding, regardless of whether or not such materials have been treated with fire
retardant.
I.   Streets And Rights Of Way:
1.   The city's street standards and specifications shall apply to all
development, except where conditions related to proper development of hillside
sensitive land areas necessitate altering these standards as described below
and elsewhere in this chapter and as may be approved by the city.

for emergency and firefighting equipment.
6.   Development sites which are located near well established canyon trails
shall provide reasonable access to those trails.
7.   Although minimum rights of way may be reduced to forty five feet (45'),
all fill slopes must be contained within the right of way.
8.   Except as explicitly waived by the planning commission, appropriate sight
triangles shall be observed at all intersections in the hillside sensitive
lands overlay zone.
9.   Variations of street design standards developed to solve special sensitive
land visual and functional problems may be presented to the planning commission
for consideration. Examples of such variations may be the use of split roadways
to avoid deep cuts, one-way streets, modifications of surface drainage for
curb, gutter and sidewalk design and other innovative designs for sensitive
lands development.
a.   The maximum grade of such streets or rights of way shall be twelve percent
(12%) except as hereafter provided.
b.   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to streets or rights of way
already constructed or which have heretofore been approved by the city.
c.   Streets shall be designed to meet the Draper City standards.
J.   Trails:

The Valle di Villa project is a master planned, architecturally controlled
residential development. The RSD zoning requirements allow for and permit
flexibility in terms of planning, site design and development through the
ability to customize the zoning and development standards to achieve singular
and unique development opportunity. The Valle di Villa project seeks to utilize
this RSD zone to enhance and create an upscale residential development on a
very prestigious, well located sixty two (62) acre parcel of property. The
Valle di Villa RSD is located at approximately 12150 South where 2000 East
Street abuts the southwest corner of the property. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A and 1A, of this article.)
Subdivision plat review is required for each portion or phase of the
development according to the requirements and standards of title 17 of this
code. Approval of this RSD acknowledges acceptance of the schematic development
plan as satisfying Draper City's requirements for the concept subdivision plan
review and approval. Preliminary and final plats will be processed and reviewed
concurrently by the city. Upon a finding that the submitted preliminary and
final plats do not substantially deviate from the approved build-out plans,
that there are not significant engineering issues to be resolved.
Section
9-17D-090, exhibits A through M of this article, define the development
standards of the project. An integral portion of the Valle di Villa RSD zone is
the ability and flexibility to plan for single-family residential lots of
various sizes which appeal to a diversity of different types of homebuyers and
family profiles. This lot size diversity allows for buyers of differing family
sizes and age variations to live in an architecturally controlled neighborhood
environment where not all of the lots and houses are virtually the same size
and price range, as are commonly found in other zoning classifications within
the city. (Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-020: PERMITTED USES:
Dwelling, single-family.
Model home/sales office.
Model homes. (Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-030: CONDITIONAL USES:
Accessory apartments.
Detached conservatories/greenhouses.
Home occupation.
Permanent storage sheds, detached garage structures, workshops, etc. (Ord. 546,
11-18-2003)
9-17D-040: ARCHITECTURAL AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A.   Density Requirement: The density of the development is 1.83 units per acre
(112 units/61 acres), which is consistent with the adjacent neighborhoods to
the east and south of the development. The Draper City general plan designates
this area as "low density residential", which is not to exceed 2.0 units per
acre.
B.   Lot Size: An area of not less than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet,
or 0.275 acre, shall be provided and maintained for each dwelling and uses
accessory thereto as a minimum for the development. Varying larger lot sizes
shall also be provided. The average lot size for the entire one hundred twelve
(112) lots in the development is approximately eighteen thousand six hundred
(18,600) square feet. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibit A of this article for lot sizes.)
C.   Frontage: The minimum width of any lot for a dwelling shall be eighty feet
(80'), measured thirty feet (30') from the front property line.
D.   Front Yard Setback Requirements:
1.   All residential structures shall be set back thirty feet (30') from the
front property line. Lots having an overall slope in excess of ten percent
(10%) may, notwithstanding other provisions of this code to the contrary, be
developed with a front setback of twenty five feet (25'). Garages or the garage
portion of the main structure, may extend to a setback line of twenty five feet
(25'), providing that they are side entry type garages.
2.   On corner lots, the front setback shall be a minimum of thirty feet (30')
and twenty five feet (25'), respectively, regardless of which way the structure
faces.
E.   Side Yard Requirements: All dwelling structures and other main buildings
shall be set back from each side property line a distance of at least ten feet
(10').
F.   Rear Yard Requirements: All dwelling structures and other main buildings
shall be set back from the rear property line a distance of at least twenty
feet (20').
G.   Natural Lots: Lots 1 - 24, 68, 86 - 89 and 109, 100, 111 and 112 (refer to
section
9-17D-090, exhibit 1A of this article) shall be considered natural lots. These
lots which contain natural existing vegetation (oakbrush) are to submit, prior
to construction, an inventory of the existing vegetation in an effort to retain
and protect as much of this natural vegetation as possible. The existing
natural trees and vegetation which occur along all side and rear lot lines are
to be preserved to a minimum distance of five feet (5') as measured from either
side of the lot property lines. Efforts will be made to sensitively establish
and preserve these areas so that they remain as natural in appearance as
possible, favoring meandering lines where vegetation must be removed, versus
straight cut lines. All side and rear yard setbacks lines are to be measured
from the lot property lines. In lots that contain thirty percent plus (30%+)
slope areas, the vegetation in these sloped (30 percent plus) areas is to be
left undisturbed. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A and 1A of this article.)
H.   Garages: Attached two (2) or three (3) car garages are required for all
dwelling units within the development. A minimum of twelve (12) lots will have
side loaded garages.
I.   Height Of Buildings: No residential dwelling or building shall be higher
than thirty five feet (35') as measured from average finish grade to the
midslope of the main structure's roofline. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibit E of this article.)
J.   Height Of Accessory Buildings: In that all accessory buildings are
considered as "conditional uses", each will be evaluated separately. However,
in any case, twenty feet (20') will be the maximum height of this type of
structure, as measured and shown in section
9-17D-090, exhibit E of this article. (Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
K.   Rooflines And Pitches: Rooflines shall be varied in pitch, height and
orientation to provide visual interest. The majority of all roof pitches on
each individual home shall be sloped at not less than six to twelve (6:12) and
no greater than twelve to twelve (12:12) in order to provide such visual
interest. Long, continuous rooflines shall not be allowed. Rooflines should be
varied to include dormers, gables, hip roofs, etc. Asphalt architectural grade,
twenty five (25) year shingles, cedar shake shingles; tile and/or masonry and
slate shingles are standard through the development. (Ord. 601, 9-14-2004)
L.   Windows: High quality cladded wood windows or vinyl windows are allowed.
Highly reflective or mirrored glass shall not be used. Decorative window
treatments such as surrounds, shutters, or nicely detailed lintels and sills
are encouraged.
M.   Building Materials: Exterior building materials shall include stone or
brick along with other high quality exterior siding products, such as stucco
and hardy board shingles, as approved by the architectural control committee.
Asphalt architectural grade, twenty five (25) year shingles, cedar shake
shingles, tile and/or masonry and slate shingles are standard through the
development.
N.   Architectural Theme: Varied high quality architectural styles are expected
and encouraged throughout the development. While not singular in terms of one
particular architectural style, the overall project theme utilizes battered
stone pillars and textured walls along the Highland Drive corridor and the
extensive use of stone facing and wrought iron railing treatments on the arched
bridge across the Bear Canyon drainage channel. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits C and D of this article.) (Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-050: OPEN SPACE/LANDSCAPE TREATMENTS:
A.   Bear Creek Preservation Area: To be preserved on the site is a naturally
occurring drainage channel extending into the property from the Pheasant Hills
PUD Subdivision to the south and ending at the boundary of the Hidden Valley
Golf Course to the west. The channel is to be largely undisturbed such that the
native vegetation and existing trees will remain to protect the natural scenic
beauty of this open space area. The thirty percent (30%) side slopes into the
drainage channel are to remain as undisturbed as much as possible. No yard or
formal landscape features or development will be allowed on the thirty percent
(30%) slope areas, except as necessary for the Highland Drive extension and
bridge, as described in subsection
9-17D-060A of this article. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A, B and D of this article.)
B.   Bear Creek Trail: An asphalt path/trail extending from the walkway system
on the east side of Highland Drive and the north side of the bridge structure
over the drainage channel will provide pedestrian/bicycle access to the channel
heading east to the Pheasant Hills area en route to Pioneer Road and the Corner
Canyon area. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits D, L and M of this article.)
C.   Thirty Percent Slope/Vegetation Preservation: The native vegetation and
existing trees in this area are to be preserved to the extent practicable.
Grading within this area is expected to be minimal extending from the thirty
percent (30%) slopes down and into the channel itself on both sides. This will
minimize the potential of erosion and soil loss and preserve the natural
character of this open space amenity. Notwithstanding these conditions, the
channel will be disturbed to extend Highland Drive across the open space
drainage channel. A bridge across the drainage channel is proposed and all
efforts to revegetate and mitigate the channel disturbance will be made. (See
section
9-17D-090, exhibit D of this article.)
D.   Fencing In Preservation Area: Only black wrought iron fencing with a flat
top rail and flat posts will be allowed at the rear lot lines and side lot
lines of lots that back onto this open space corridor, including the area up to
the thirty percent (30%) slope line. This fencing will extend up those side lot
lines to the beginning of the thirty percent (30%) slope line, and is intended
to be as visually unobtrusive as possible. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A and 1A of this article.)
E.   Stormwater Detention Open Space: The area west of the Highland Drive
bridge structure is to be used for a stormwater detention basin for the
development. This triangular shaped property currently terminates at the fence
line along Hidden Valley Golf Course. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A and 1A of this article.)
F.   Pedestrian Circulation Trails: As illustrated in section
9-17D-090, exhibits A, C, D, F, G, I, J, L and M of this article, the Valle di
Villa development features an extensive pedestrian circulation system which
links together the various open space elements of the project. Section
9-17D-090, exhibits I and J of this article illustrate where the interior
pedestrian paths intersect the roadways. These roadway nodes include specialty
concrete paving area, benches, wrought iron fencing and high quality landscape
elements. These paths connect the various areas of the development one to
another such that all can safely access the gazebo park area and Bear Creek
Trail area easily.
G.   Gazebo/Park Area: As shown in section
9-17D-090, exhibits A, H, K and L of this article, a uniquely designed gazebo
with specialty landscaping, benches and pedestrian lighting is included in the
public open space area. This formal park area is approximately one-half (1/2)
acre and is adjacent to the Bear Creek open space preservation area and the
open space detention area west of the Bear Creek Bridge. The location of this
park and open space area, which is near the entrance to the project from
Highland Drive, is very visually pleasing and enhances the feeling of the open
area. It is also connected to the generously landscaped Highland Drive
pedestrian walks and the interior trail circulation system of the project.
(Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-060: ROADWAYS, STREETS AND LANDSCAPE TREATMENTS:
A.   Highland Drive Extension: The extension of Highland Drive is to be
constructed by the developer to a width of forty two feet (42') as measured
from the back of curb to the back of curb. This roadway is referred to as a
"modified collector road" and will accommodate one lane of traffic in each
direction and a center turn lane. Also, the developer will install a five foot
(5') meandering sidewalk on each side of the Highland Drive extension through
the thirty two foot (32') remainder areas of the one hundred six foot (106')
right of way dedication. A six foot (6') masonry wall will be constructed along
the right of way/property line along both the east and west sides of the
Highland Drive corridor. The walls will feature battered stone columns and
textured walls. The thirty two foot (32') right of way areas on either side of
the modified collector roadway will be generously bermed and landscaped along
the entire length of the corridor. Efforts will be made to establish the
majority of the trees and shrubbery closely adjacent to the right of way walls
themselves to help attenuate noise generated by Highland Drive and to help
preserve this landscape buffering vegetation the event that Highland Drive is
widened in the future. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A, B, C, D and F of this article.)
B.   Typical Local Street: Throughout the development, local streets will be
constructed with a forty eight foot (48') total dedicated width with a roadway
section of thirty feet (30') as measured from back of curb to back of curb.
There will be a seven foot (7') utility easement on one side of the road, and a
six foot (6') utility easement/plant strip with a five foot (5') sidewalk on
the opposite side. (See section
9-17D-090, exhibits A and G of this article.)
C.   Single-Family Dwelling Landscaping: All front yard landscaping, including
required street trees, shall be installed within six (6) months of occupancy.
(Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-070: FENCING:
No front yard fencing is to be allowed. Masonry, wrought iron and earth tone
vinyl fencing are allowed in the development to a maximum height of six feet
zero inches (6'0"). No fencing will be allowed that has any type of spike or
spear effect on the top rail or fence posts, with the exception of the black
wrought iron as explained in subsection
9-17D-050D of this article. (Ord. 546, 11-18-2003)
9-17D-080: HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION:
A Valle di Villa Homeowners' Association will be formed and maintained in
perpetuity to care for and maintain the publicly accessible open space and
landscape elements and features as designed throughout the development. (Ord.
546, 11-18-2003)

The Bellevue project is a master planned architecturally controlled residential
development by the "developer". The residential special district (RSD) zoning
requirements allow for and permit flexibility in terms of planning, site
design, lot size and development through the ability to customize the zoning
and development standards to achieve unique development opportunity. The
Bellevue project seeks to utilize this RSD zone, which provides the flexibility
required to make possible significant project, community and system
improvements and amenities. The Bellevue RSD is located between 13200 South and
Corner Canyon Creek, 300 East and the East Jordan Canal. (See
figure 1 of this section.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-5287.png]
 
Subdivision plat review is required for each portion or phase of the
development according to the requirements and standards of title 17 of this
code. Approval of this RSD acknowledges acceptance of the Bellevue concept land
use plan, dated May 27, 2003 (see
figure 2 of this section), as satisfying Draper City's requirements for the
concept subdivision plan reviewed and accepted. Preliminary and final plats
will be processed and reviewed by the city, and accepted upon a finding that
the submitted preliminary and final plats do not substantially deviate from the
approved concept land use plan and this RSD zone text, and that there are not
significant engineering issues to be resolved. The Bellevue RSD concept land
use plan is conceptual in nature and shall be subject to amendment in
accordance with the terms of the Bellevue RSD zone text, so long as the terms
are in accordance with this code governing such amendments.

An integral portion of the Bellevue RSD zone is the ability and flexibility to
plan for single-family residential lots of various sizes that appeal to a
diversity of various types of homebuyers and family profiles. This lot size
diversity allows for buyers of differing family sizes and age variations to
live in an architecturally controlled neighborhood environment where not all of
the lots and houses are virtually the same size and price range, as are
commonly found in other zoning classifications within the city.
Figures 1 through
21, as incorporated in this article, define the development standards of the
project. Section
9-17E-080, appendices A, B, and C of this article are incorporated at the end
of this article. (Ord. 520, 5-27-2003)
9-17E-020: PERMITTED USES:
Church, synagogue or other place of worship.
Dwelling, single-family.
Elementary school.
Home occupation, standard.
Model home/sales office.
Model homes (subject to title 17 of this code). (Ord. 520, 5-27-2003)
9-17E-030: CONDITIONAL USES:
Accessory apartments, guesthouse.
Detached conservatories/greenhouses.
Home occupation, extended/advanced. (Ord. 520, 5-27-2003)
9-17E-040: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A.   Density Requirement: The maximum number of lots shall be three hundred
forty three (343). The property survey identified the parcel as having one
hundred thirty six (136) acres. The density of the development is 2.52 units
per acre (343 units per 136 acres, excluding school), which is well within the
guidelines of the density element of the general plan of Draper City. The
density is also compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
B.   Lot Size: An area of not less than nine thousand seven hundred (9,700)
square feet, or 0.22 acre, shall be provided and maintained for each dwelling
and uses accessory thereto as a minimum for the development. Varying larger lot
sizes shall also be provided. Largest lot sizes are greater than twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet or 0.46 acre. The average lot size for the entire
development is approximately twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. (See
figure 3 of this section for lot sizes and distribution.)
C.   Frontage: The minimum width of any lot for a dwelling shall be eighty feet
(80'), measured at the front setback line. While this standard represents the
minimum lot width, the majority of the lots in the development have a lot
frontage of at least ninety feet (90'). This increased lot width allows for the
construction of larger homes.
D.   Front Yard Setback Requirements:
1.   All residential structures shall be set back a minimum of twenty three
feet (23') from the front property line. In order to provide an element of
visual relief, front setback variations are to be encouraged, ranging between
twenty three (23) and thirty feet (30') minimum.
2.   On corner lots, the front setback shall be a minimum of twenty five feet
(25').
E.   Side Yard Requirements: All dwelling structures and other main buildings
shall be set back a distance of at least eight feet (8') on one side and a
total of at least eighteen feet (18') combined both sides from the side
property lines. Garage side shall be the larger dimension, and shall be a
minimum of ten feet (10'). Side yard setback requirement for a corner lot,
adjacent to a street, shall be a distance of at least twenty feet (20') from
the side property line at such street.
F.   Rear Yard Requirements: All dwelling structures and other main buildings
shall be set back from the rear property line a distance of at least twenty
feet (20').
G.   Parking: A minimum of two (2) off street parking spaces shall be required
for each dwelling unit as required by this code.

H.   Height Of Buildings: Height shall be measured according to the code as
currently adopted by the state of Utah at the time of application for building
permit. (Ord. 520, 5-27-2003)
I.   Rooflines And Pitches: Rooflines shall be varied in pitch, height and
orientation to provide visual interest. The majority of all roof pitches on
each individual home shall be sloped at not less than six to twelve (6:12) and
no greater than twelve to twelve (12:12) in order to provide such visual
interest. Long, continuous rooflines shall not be allowed. Rooflines should be
varied to include dormers, gables, hip roofs, etc. Asphalt architectural grade,
twenty five (25) year shingles, cedar shake shingles; tile and/or masonry and
slate shingles are standard through the development. (Ord. 602, 9-14-2004)
J.   Windows: High quality cladded wood windows or vinyl windows are allowed.
Highly reflective or mirrored glass shall not be used. Decorative window
treatments such as surrounds, shutters, or nicely detailed lintels and sills
are encouraged.
K.   Building Materials: Homes in the Bellevue neighborhood will use high
quality exterior finishes to include stone, brick and stucco combinations,
hardy board siding, raw timber, copper detailing, shutters and other high
quality exterior siding products as approved by the architectural review
committee (ARC) 1 . Aluminum siding shall be allowed only for soffit and
fascia. Additional architectural design features such as porches, bays,
cantilevers, columns, balconies, landscaped window wells, gridded windows and
soffit crowns will be included throughout the development to provide variety
and relief on all sides of the building. Sophisticated architectural lines,
steep roof pitches and dramatic entries will be used to make a statement on the
craft of the building.
L.   Added Visual Character: Homes sitting on corner lots identified in the
list below shall include added elements of architectural relief on sides that
are exposed to the road. Examples of such architectural relief may, at the
developer's option, include stucco "pop outs", bays, box windows, hip roofs
side entry garages, and the use of different colors. If a home on a corner lot
requiring added visual character has brick or stucco wainscots, that element
will be carried around the side of the home that fronts the street. Elements
will be applied per plan. The following lots (as shown in section
9-17E-030, figure 2 of this article) are identified as lots requiring added
visual character: 1, 20, 41, 52, 54, 64, 68, 74, 86, 106, 114, 141, 149, 150,
166, 184, 195, 202 and 203. (Actual lot numbers may change by preliminary plat,
but shall be cross referenced back to this document.)

M.   Basements: Basements shall be permitted within the development, provided
they comply with Draper City's engineering standards and criteria for
construction of basements.
N.   Repeat Plan Limitations: No two (2) homes shall have the same elevation on
adjoining lots.
O.   Project Theme: Varied high quality architectural styles are expected and
encouraged throughout the development. While not singular in terms of one
particular architectural style, the overall project theme utilizes a rustic
alpine style. The characteristics of this style, which are reflected in the
design of the entry feature (
figure 5 of this section), bridges and walls (
figures 6,
7 and
8 of this section), include the look of rough cut stone and timbers. Precast,
faux stone walls, textured and colored, will be installed along Lone Rock
Drive, 300 East and 13200 South. In addition, themed lighting, benches,
pedestrian friendly trails (section
9-17E-060,
figure 21 of this article) will also be included along Lone Rock Drive. All
entry features within the proposed right of way require approval by Draper
City, and will be maintained by a homeowners' association. The planting design
will accentuate this style through random, informal plantings.

P.   Project Lighting: Decorative downlighting will be used along Lone Rock
Drive and at the Community Park. The Draper City standard light fixture will be
used along all local streets. The developer is willing to work with the city to
find an appropriate alternative with similar cost to the current standard.
Q.   Fencing: No front yard fencing is to be allowed, unless otherwise approved
by the ACC. If approved, no fence can exceed three feet (3') in height in a
front yard. Masonry, precast, wrought iron, wood and vinyl fencing, and other
high quality materials as approved by the ARC are allowed in the development,
back and side yards, to a maximum height of six feet zero inches (6'0") for
security and privacy. At the south side of 13200 South, and at the east sides
of 300 East and Lone Rock Drive fencing shall consist of precast concrete, six
feet (6') in height, with a faux stone architectural treatment, color and
texture to highlight the thematic elements of the development. The roadside
shall also be landscaped, per the adopted Draper City street tree plan, with
additional shrubs, trees, vines/ivy to provide visual relief and interest along
the fence. (See
figures 7 and
8 of this section.) A street tree plan has been submitted to the city as part
of the concept acceptance process (see section
9-17E-060,
figure 20 of this article).

R.   Additional Documentation: Geotechnical, hydrological, traffic and other
engineering reports will be submitted with the preliminary plat if required by
this code or if required to deal with a specific project issue. (Ord. 520, 5-
27-2003)
 
Notes
  1. An architectural review committee will be created and maintained by the
1 homeowners' association. Details of the ARC will be contained in the CC&Rs
  which will be recorded with all phases of the Bellevue project.
9-17E-050: OPEN SPACE/LANDSCAPE TREATMENTS:
The developer shall work together with the city parks and trails committee to
provide design recommendations and further details to the planning commission
and city council for approval during the preliminary plat process for the
elements described below:
A.   Bellevue Park: As shown in
figure 9 of this section, developer will dedicate property to Draper City for
the Bellevue Park. This formal park area is approximately 4.45 acres, including
the trail connection to the east. The location of this park makes it readily
accessible - walkable, from each of the surrounding neighborhoods through the
network of trails, sidewalks, pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes. Draper
City shall be responsible for long term maintenance of the park at its expense.
The developer shall dedicate the park area to the city in phase with the
adjoining lots. In addition to dedicating the underlying land to the city for
the park, at no cost to the city, the developer, as part of the RSD designation
shall construct the trails along Lone Rock Drive and 13200 South adjacent to
the park. Also, developer shall pay for the first two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000.00) of Bellevue Park improvements. Furthermore, the developer desires
to see a fully developed park as soon as is practical and is therefore willing
to advance the costs of any additional park amenities and improvements that
Draper City shall request, subject to a reimbursement agreement for any costs
over and above the initial two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). Final
park design shall be reviewed and approved by Draper City during the
preliminary plat process.

B.   Fort Street Parkway: A pedestrian friendly trail connection to Fort Street
will be constructed at the time 13200 South is tied into Fort Street. The
developer shall provide at its cost the underlying land to the city for the
parkway, as well as the basic initial amenity package. This amenity package
shall be designed by the developer, and shall include the following: grading,
basic landscaping and irrigation system, asphalt trail, pedestrian crossing,
lighting and benches. Draper City shall be responsible for maintenance of the
land and amenities at its cost. The Fort Street Parkway adds approximately 1.5
acres of open space.
C.   Corner Canyon Creek Pocket Park: The developer shall provide approximately
0.4 acre of park/open space at the southwest corner of the project as shown in
figure 10 of this section. The developer shall provide the underlying land as
well as grading and initial amenities including a tot lot type playground,
asphalt trails, benches, landscaping and irrigation. This area provides a
recreational area for families with smaller children who may desire an
alternate to Smith Fields Park. In conjunction with the trail connection to the
elementary school, this park provides an important open space link between
Smith Fields Park, the elementary school and the Corner Canyon Creek facility.
A secondary use of the park is stormwater detention. In addition, a portion of
the elementary school property is to be used for detention. Additional small
detention areas, to be identified during preliminary plat may also be
necessary. Maintenance responsibilities shall be split as follows: Bellevue HOA
shall maintain the park, landscape, irrigation, benches and any playground
equipment at its expense; Draper City shall maintain the storm drain
components, as well as the public trail at its expense.

Corner Canyon Creek Pocket Park
D.   Pedestrian Circulation Trails: As illustrated in
figure 11 of this section, the Bellevue development features an extensive
pedestrian circulation system which links together the various open space
elements of the project. Where the interior pedestrian paths intersect the
roadways, pedestrian crossings will be constructed. (See
figure 12 of this section.) These roadway crossings include specialty concrete
or asphalt paving areas (i.e., stamped asphalt, and/or concrete pavers) to
provide traffic calming effects, as well as benches, wrought iron or vinyl rail
fencing and high quality landscape elements. Final design shall be reviewed and
approved by Draper City. These paths connect the various areas of the
development one to another such that all can safely access the park areas, the
school, and Corner Canyon Creek, as well as destinations such as Smith Fields
Park outside of the project area. The Bellevue homeowners' association shall
maintain interior trail connections, (as shown in
figure 11 of this section and depicted in section
9-17E-060,
figure 21 of this article). Publicly accessible trails and bridges (as shown in
figure 11 of this section) such as those at Corner Canyon Creek, 13200 South,
300 East, Lone Rock Drive, Fort Street parkway and the city park shall be
maintained by Draper City.

B.   300 East: Major collector status. The developer will construct and
dedicate a twenty four foot (24') dedicated roadway width (centerline to back
of curb as shown above) for the installation of 300 East for Draper City. An
extended trail, park strip, and fence - twenty three feet (23') wide from back
of curb, will be constructed on the east side of 300 East from 13200 South to
Corner Canyon Creek. (See
figures 15 and
20 of this section.) The trail will be an eight feet (8') wide, meandering
asphalt path. Landscaping and fence are described elsewhere. Final plans and
sections shall be reviewed and approved by the Draper City engineer based on
the proposed road sections shown in this document. The developer shall
coordinate with the Draper City engineer to construct and dedicate 300 East as
indicated in section
9-17E-010,
figure 2 of this article to accommodate the design and construction by the city
of a roundabout at the intersection of 13200 South and 300 East. Developer
shall construct an additional access road to 300 East in the southwest quadrant
of the Bellevue development (see section
9-17E-010,
figure 2 of this article). The final alignment and location shall be determined
during the preliminary plat process by Draper City engineering, in consultation
with the traffic engineer and the updated traffic study.

Perspective view of Lone Rock Drive (looking north)
    C.   Lone Rock Drive Minor Collector Status: This street, which provides a
connection between 500 East and 700 East, is proposed to have a seventy six
foot (76') right of way. A roundabout is proposed at the location shown on the
concept plan. The street will be constructed with a forty foot (40') paved
roadway (back of curb to back of curb) and will include a five foot (5') walk
and 7.5 foot park strip on the west side, and an eight foot (8') asphalt path
within a 23.5 foot landscaped area on the east side. (See
figures 16,
17,
18 and
20 of this section.) The proposed roundabout design and final plans and
sections shall be reviewed and approved by the Draper City engineer based on
the proposed road sections shown in this document. Lone Rock Drive shall be
constructed and open to traffic from Bellevue's southern property line to 13200
South prior to issuance by the city of the one hundredth certificate of
occupancy for homes in the Bellevue RSD. The bridge on Lone Rock Drive over
Corner Canyon Creek, as indicated on the city's master transportation plan,
shall be constructed with the city and developer sharing the cost equally as is
set out in section
9-17E-080 of this article, "appendix C". The developer will advance the costs
for the traffic bridge over Corner Canyon Creek as indicated on the city's
transportation master plan subject to a reimbursement agreement.

    D.   Typical Local Street: Throughout the development, local streets will
be constructed with a fifty five foot (55') total dedicated width, with a
roadway section of thirty feet (30') as measured from back of curb to back of
curb. This slight road narrowing from the Draper City standard is to provide a
traffic calming effect. There will be a 7.5 foot park strip and five foot (5')
sidewalk on each side of the road. Street trees have been selected from the
Draper City street tree plan which is approved for the 7.5 foot park strip.
(See
figure 20 of this section.) Public utility easements are contained within the
park strip on both sides of local streets, as well as behind the sidewalks.
(See
figure 19 of this section.) This local street cross section will be expanded to
approximately forty feet (40') adjacent to the elementary school to provide on
street parking. Final plans and sections shall be reviewed and approved by the
Draper City engineer based on the proposed road sections shown in this
document.

E.   Public Parks, Trails And Open Space: A landscape plan approved by the city
for each phase of the development shall be required before final plat approval
of that phase of the development. Water conservation shall be encouraged
through the use of xeriscape landscape techniques, designed by a landscape
architect and reviewed and approved by the city, particularly on public parks,
trails (see
figure 21 of this section) and open space to be maintained by Draper City.
Developer shall retain the right, at its sole discretion and cost, to add
private trails and/or a private park or other open space (not in place of the
public park as set out in the concept plan) to the accepted concept plan during
either the preliminary or final plat process. Developer shall not be required
to pursue an amendment to the accepted concept plan or RSD zone text so long as
the lot count does not increase and major road alignment does not change
significantly by so doing.

The Draper Peaks Commercial Special District is an area approximately sixty
(60) acres in size, located at the convergence of the City's two (2) gateway
entrances along 12300 South and Interstate 15. With its high level of
visibility to residents and visitors alike, architectural integrity and quality
design controls are crucial to implementing the City's goals and objectives.
The Draper Peaks Commercial Center is a master planned mixed use project with
multiple architecturally compatible buildings, located along Draper City's
major commercial corridor of 12300 South. The project will incorporate the
community's design goals for commercial and residential development in all
aspects. The existing Draper Crossing project, built in 1997, is also within
the special district zone boundaries. While the zone regulations will have less
impact within this portion of the district, as buildings are renovated the
architectural design elements of the district will be enforced. Design cohesion
will take time but will be incrementally implemented in the Draper Peaks
portion of the district. The special district zone also incorporates property
along Factory Outlet Drive from 12300 South to 12150 South. (Ord. 611, 11-2-

9-18A-040: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A.   Commercial: The Draper Peaks commercial special district will provide
design guidelines for the buildings, landscaping, parking, housing and signage
located within the district boundaries. The Draper Peaks project is a master
planned mixed use development containing approximately sixty (60) acres of
developed and undeveloped land along the 12300 South arterial corridor. The
master plan provides for commercial and residential development in designated
areas of the district in accordance with the development standards set forth
herein. The commercial phase of new construction along the north side of 12300
South has five (5) pad sites along the frontage, four (4) multi-tenant
buildings on either side of a central entrance boulevard and approximately one
hundred eighty thousand (180,000) square feet of retail space in several
buildings along the rear of the site as shown on the site plan, section
9-18A-090, exhibit A of this article. All commercial buildings within the
district shall comply with the following development standards:
1.   All buildings shall share a similar architectural theme as depicted in
drawings incorporated in section
9-18A-090, exhibit B of this article, including stacked ledge stone. Design
elements shall be used to add interest on all visible sides of buildings.
2.   Where an elevation of a building faces 12300 South or Factory Outlet Drive
but has no entrance onto such roads, a minimum of ten percent (10%) of said
wall shall be glass or other architectural element of interest.
3.   No one building shall be larger than one hundred twenty thousand (120,000)
square feet.
4.   The minimum front setback shall be twelve feet (12').
5.   For every one thousand (1,000) square feet of commercial space, there
shall be five (5) parking stalls.
6.   No building shall be taller than fifty five feet (55').
7.   All mechanical equipment shall be screened from view, either by enclosure
or parapet wall.
8.   Dumpsters shall be enclosed within a decorative masonry enclosure designed
to be compatible with overall project architecture.
9.   Outdoor storage and display is prohibited.
B.   Residential Component: The residential component is located north of the
commercial phase on the north side of the proposed east-west local street,
12150 South. The property will be developed into high density housing, up to
twenty (20) units per acre. The location, within a block of the UTA transit
stop and the commercial core, is ideal for this type of housing product. A
detailed site plan will be required for planning commission review and
approval. Development of the residential component within the district shall
comply with the following development standards:
1.   All buildings shall share a similar architectural theme as depicted in
drawings incorporated in section
9-18A-090, exhibit E of this article, including stacked ledge stone, hip roof,
knee braces.
2.   No building shall be taller than forty five feet (45').
3.   Incorporate a minimum of one indoor and two (2) outdoor amenities within
the design.
C.   Draper Crossing: The Draper Crossing portion of the commercial special
district on the south side of 12300 South was built in 1997. The district
guidelines and development standards will regulate the renovation of the
existing center. While development and design standards have already been
adopted for the Draper Crossing project, the CSD standards will serve to
supplement these guidelines to ensure architectural similarities along this
critical corridor. As such, buildings shall incorporate design elements as
shown in section
9-18A-090, exhibit B of this article when renovated through a building permit.
(Ord. 611, 11-2-2004; amd. Ord. 1405, 10-8-2019)
9-18A-050: LANDSCAPE STANDARDS:
A.   Commercial: The Draper Peaks commercial center and future phases will be
landscaped with sensitivity to its desert environment. Drought tolerant trees,
shrubs, grasses and perennials will complement the earth tone desert
architecture with year round color. A desert rock water feature along the
center boulevard shall be constructed. Decorative light fixtures, tree grates
and outdoor furniture shall be constructed to further enhance and enliven this
boulevard. Another critical component of the proposed landscaping plan is the
planting of over sixty (60) shade trees within tree diamonds throughout the
parking lot. On the western perimeter, trees shall be planted every thirty feet
(30') on center in a ten foot (10') landscaped buffer. A landscaped buffer
shall be installed on the eastern perimeter, approximately twenty feet (20')
wide by two hundred forty feet (240') long and shall include at least twelve
(12) trees. The landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the landscape
plan as shown in section
9-18A-090, exhibit C of this article.
B.   Residential: The residential component will be landscaped in drought
tolerant landscaping species compatible with the commercial component,
incorporating the trellis element where possible. The landscaping plan will be
submitted along with the residential site plan to be reviewed and approved by
the Planning Commission. The residential project will be required to satisfy
the typical forty percent (40%) landscaping required by chapter 32 of this
title.
C.   Draper Crossing: The Draper Crossing portion of the Commercial Special
District has existing mature landscaping installed in accordance with the
design guidelines. As plant material is replaced, drought tolerant species will
be installed. All new landscaping plans submitted for approval will utilize the
revised standards shown in section
9-18A-090, exhibit C of this article.
D.   Factory Outlet Drive: Property to be developed along Factory Outlet Drive
shall be landscaped in accordance with the landscaping requirements for the
commercial component along 12300 South. Landscaping plans shall be submitted to
the Planning Division for review and approval in accordance with the
landscaping standards set forth herein. (Ord. 611, 11-2-2004)
9-18A-060: PARKING DESIGN:
Commercial development within the Draper Peaks Special District will require
five (5) parking stalls for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of retail or
restaurant space. Each stall must measure at least nine feet (9') wide by
eighteen feet (18') long, with ADA accessible stalls provided in accordance
with established standards. Parking lot lighting shall provide adequate
illumination and shall be no taller than thirty five feet (35'). Pedestrian
corridors shall be identified by a change in color and/or texture of pavement
material. Tree diamonds measuring five by five (5 x 5) shall be installed
throughout the parking areas. The residential component will utilize surface
parking. The number of stalls required will be based on a parking analysis to
include the number of bedrooms within the project and any special population
effects. Parking must be located within the project, hidden from the
surrounding street network to the greatest extent practical. (Ord. 611, 11-2-
2004)
9-18A-070: SIGNAGE:
A.   General Requirements For All Signs:

9-18B-010: PURPOSE:
The Dahle commercial special district (the "Dahle CSD") is hereby created to
facilitate commercial development in the West Bangerter area. The area is
characterized by large vacant parcels with freeway frontage and visibility and
ample access to frontage roads. It is approximately thirty nine (39) acres in
size. Given the site's prominence, the city anticipates a substantial retail
presence within the Dahle CSD that forwards the community's economic
development goals. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)

1-10-2023)
9-18B-030: SCHEMATIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS:
Development within the Dahle CSD shall be substantially in accordance with a
schematic development plan as shown in section
9-18B-110, exhibit A of this article, or a schematic development plan that
combines any substantial elements of such exhibits. Development within the
Dahle CSD may be in phases. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)
9-18B-040: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Principal Building: A single building with a floor area in excess of
one hundred eighty thousand (180,000) square feet shall be designated as the
"principal building" within the Dahle CSD. The principal building shall be
located within the "building envelope" on lot 1 of the Dahle CSD as shown in
section 9-18B-110, exhibit A of this article.
   B.   Major Building: A single building with a floor area in excess of one
hundred forty thousand (140,000) square feet shall be designated as the "major
building" within the Dahle CSD. The major building shall be located within the
"building envelope" on lot 2 of the Dahle CSD as shown in section 9-18B-110,
exhibit A of this article.
   C.   Building Height: Maximum building height for all buildings shall be
forty five feet (45'), except that the principal building and the major
building may have additional architectural features, including, without
limitation, cornices, crenellations, and towers, up to fifteen feet (15') above
such forty five foot (45') height. Notwithstanding anything else contained
herein, the major building may have the architectural features shown in section
9-18B-110, exhibit C of this article.
   D.   Building Design: For the principal building and the major building, a
design consistent with each user's corporate determined architectural style
shall be permitted. For the principal building and the major building, tilt-up
type construction shall be permitted with no required added architectural
materials, such as brick, rock, or other masonry. Once the principal building
and major building have been completed, future design changes to the principal
building and the major building may be approved by the zoning administrator and
the city engineer only, as provided in section 9-18B-100 of this article.
   E.   Dumpsters: Dumpsters containing wet garbage shall be enclosed within a
decorative masonry enclosure designed to be compatible with the adjoining
building. This does not apply to enclosed compactors or dumpsters and tractor
trailers used only for recycling dry wood, glass and paper products.
   F.   Outdoor Storage, Display: Permanent outdoor storage and display is
prohibited, except that the users of the principal building and the major
building may each have up to four (4) temporary outdoor promotions, displays or
sales events each year, separate and apart from each other and/or occurring at
the same or different times, each such display lasting up to twenty one (21)
days, to be located contiguous to their respective buildings and/or in their
parking lots.
   G.   Setbacks: The principal building shall be set back from property lines
by at least thirty feet (30') on all sides. All other buildings shall be set
back from property lines by at least twenty feet (20').
   H.   Buffers: No buffers between land uses on properties outside of the
Dahle CSD are required.
   I.   Detention Areas: All detention areas shall have three to one (3:1) or
flatter slopes regardless of who maintains.
   J.   Commercial Loading Space: For the principal building and major
building, one commercial loading space per every fifty thousand (50,000) square
feet of use is required.
   K.   Lot Size, Frontage: No minimum lot size or frontage is required. (Ord.
1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)
9-18B-050: LANDSCAPE STANDARDS:
A.   Generally: The Dahle CSD shall require landscaping with sensitivity to its
low precipitation environment, and the amount of parking required in a large
scale commercial development. Drought tolerant trees, shrubs, grasses and
perennials are encouraged with a goal of year round color. Another critical
component of the proposed landscaping plan is parking lot landscaping, with the
goal of shade and refuge from the heat islands of large parking lots. Portions
of commercial sites developed within the boundaries of the Dahle CSD shall be
required to provide the minimum overall landscape percentage described in
subsection B of this section. Section
9-18B-010 of this article notes that one of the important characteristics of
the Dahle CSD is its freeway frontage and visibility. Accordingly,
notwithstanding anything else in this article, in order to preserve freeway and
frontage visibility of the major building, the landscape buffer that runs north
to south between the principal building and the major building shall be
completely landscaped with shrubs and vegetation that will not exceed a maximum
height of three feet (3').
B.   Landscape Percentages: As the Dahle CSD develops, each phase shall meet
the minimum fifteen percent (15%) overall landscape percentage. This is a
cumulative total which can be calculated as total landscaped area over the
developed site area, it being understood and agreed that, the "developed site
area" shall include both the area of the lot to be developed and the area of
any other additional property made available to the relevant applicant, by
easement or otherwise, for landscaping purposes. By way of example, the
landscape percentage for lot 2 on which the major building will be located is
estimated to have 12.16 percent landscaping based only on the area of lot 2,
but in determining the minimum fifteen percent (15%) overall landscape
percentage required under this provision, the development of lot 2 for the
major building may include and be credited with not only the percentage of
landscaped area located on lot 2 but also an additional ten thousand (10,000)
square feet of area landscaped by the owner of lot 2 in accordance with this
provision, that the owner of lot 8 (the detention basin property adjacent to
lot 2) makes available to the owner of lot 2 by way of easement. Landscaping
within the public right of way shall not be calculated in the overall landscape
percentage.
C.   Specific Requirements: Specific landscaping requirements are:
1.   To mitigate the reduced overall landscaping, more intensive plantings in
certain areas may be required.
2.   Tree diamonds or islands measuring a minimum of twenty five (25) square
feet shall be installed throughout the parking area at a rate of one tree for
every twenty five (25) parking stalls. Tree diamonds or islands at the end of
parking rows and on the perimeter of parking areas are required and shall be
counted in calculating the requirements of this subsection C2. See section
9-18B-110, exhibit B of this article for typical parking area landscape detail.
3.   Screening of parking areas from adjacent public streets shall include two
foot (2') high shrubs or berming, which may be substituted by a screen wall of
equal height. The approved screening location for the major building's loading
docks is shown in section
9-18B-110, exhibit D of this article. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-
10-2023)
9-18B-060: PARKING DESIGN:
A.   Required Parking: For uses greater than one hundred eighty thousand
(180,000) square feet, required parking shall be 2.5 stalls for every one
thousand (1,000) square feet of commercial use; for uses equal to or greater
than one hundred forty thousand (140,000) square feet but less than one hundred
eighty thousand (180,000) square feet, required parking shall be 2.83 stalls
for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of commercial use; for uses equal to
or greater than seventy five thousand (75,000) square feet but less than one
hundred forty thousand (140,000) square feet, required parking shall be 4.5
stalls for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of commercial use; for uses
less than seventy five thousand (75,000) square feet, required parking shall be
five (5) parking stalls for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of
commercial use, except that for sit down restaurants, the ratio shall be
modified to ten (10) stalls for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of
commercial use. However, for any anticipated use, or combination of uses,
modifications to the standards may be authorized, if justified by a parking
study and approved by the planning commission, in accordance with section 9-25-
090 of this title. Such study must present data on the proposed uses, square
footages and floor plans, hours of operation, and shared parking areas within
the sites.
B.   Pedestrian Corridors: Pedestrian corridors shall be identified by a change
in color or scoring of pavement material, or striping with an emphasis on
pedestrian safety. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023; Ord. 1581,
5-16-2023)
9-18B-070: LIGHTING:
Parking lot lighting shall provide illumination without spillage into adjacent
residential areas, as verified by a photometric plan submitted with the site
plan for each lot or phase of development. Site lighting for buildings shall
not exceed thirty five feet (35') in height. The lighting source must be
recessed and shielded. Parking lot lighting may remain on after each lot
owner's regular hours of business operations. Notwithstanding anything else
contained herein, the parking lot lighting for the major building and lot 2 may
match the specifications for the currently as built lighting for the principal
building and lot 1. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)
9-18B-080: SIGNAGE:
A.   Tower Signs: Signage is very important to the success of the Dahle CSD.
Freeway frontage of more than one thousand three hundred feet (1,300') warrants
special signage consideration. For this reason, the district shall be allowed
one project tower sign not to exceed one hundred feet (100') in height (the
"project tower sign"), two (2) tower signs not to exceed forty feet (40') in
height (the "2 tower signs"), and one tower sign not to exceed twelve feet
(12') in height (the "small tower sign"). These tower signs shall have the
additional features described hereafter:
1.   The project tower sign shall have the following specifications:
a.   It may be up to one hundred feet (100') in height;
b.   It may have up to two thousand (2,000) square feet in area;
c.   It may be multisided with sign panels on each side, but shall be supported
by three (3) integrally designed supports; and
d.   It shall be located on or about the southeast corner of lot 1.
2.   The two (2) tower signs shall have the following specifications:
a.   They each may be up to forty feet (40') in height and be twenty five feet
(25') wide;
b.   They each may be double sided with sign panels on each side;
c.   A total of two hundred (200) square feet of sign panel signage may be
located on each side of each of these two (2) tower signs; and
d.   One of these two (2) tower signs shall be located on or about the
northwest corner of lot 2 and the other of these two (2) tower signs shall be
located on or about the northeast corner of lot 3 in the Dahle CSD as shown in
section
9-18B-110, exhibit A of this article.
3.   The small tower sign shall have the following specifications:
a.   It may be up to twelve feet (12') in height and be 7.5 feet wide;
b.   It may be double sided with sign panels on each side;
c.   A total of fifty (50) square feet of sign panel signage may be located on
each side of this small tower sign; and
d.   It shall be located on or about the northeast corner of lot 5 in the Dahle
CSD as shown in section
9-18B-110, exhibit A of this article.
The project tower sign, the two (2) tower signs and the small tower sign shall
be consistent with the quality of signs typically found in class A shopping
centers and may be multi-tenant. An example of this kind of tower sign is the
tower sign installed within the Draper Peaks CSD. Tower sign locations shall be
generally as shown on the site plan. No digital or reader board signs will be
permitted within the Dahle CSD.
B.   Wall Signs: Wall signs on buildings other than the principal building and
major building may be installed by individual businesses based on 1.5 square
feet per linear foot of building wall, which shall be internally illuminated.
For the principal building and the major building, this ratio will be increased
to 2.0 square feet per linear foot of building wall in total, which total
square footage can be reallocated among building facades by occupants within
the principal building and the major building. Wall signs on the principal
building and the major building may be illuminated in a manner consistent with
the user's corporate determined architectural style, whether internally or
externally illuminated. Wall signs on principal buildings may be electronic
message center signs and shall comply with the standards found in
9-26-090(D)(1) of this title.
C.   Directional, Informational Signs: Within lot 1 and lot 2, directional and
informational signage shall not exceed thirteen feet (13') in height and may be
located throughout the parking and circulation areas of such lots. Within lot 1
and lot 2, signage design consistent with the lot user's corporate determined
architectural style shall be permitted. Separate sign permits are not required
for directional and informational signage, and shall be considered approved as
noted and located on the approved site plan for each phase or lot. Directional
and informational signage shall not be counted as monument or building signage.
D.   Flags, Banners: Decorative flags and banners are also an important
component of the Dahle CSD. These flags and banners contribute to a festive
atmosphere consistent with desirable commercial projects with freeway
visibility in Draper City. Flags and banners may be externally illuminated by
spotlights or similar lights. Poles for flags shall not exceed forty feet (40')
in height and they may vary in circumference and diameter. For the principal
building, a total of twenty four (24) flags and one building mounted banner
shall be allowed so long as the design is consistent with the user's corporate
determined architectural style, and each flag size shall not exceed six feet
(6') wide by eighteen feet (18') tall, and the building mounted banner shall
not exceed thirty feet (30') wide by twenty feet (20') high. For the major
building, a total of twelve (12) flags and one building mounted banner shall be
allowed so long as the design is consistent with the user's corporate
determined architectural style, and each flag size shall not exceed six feet
(6') wide by eighteen feet (18') tall, and the building mounted banner shall
not exceed thirty feet (30') wide by fifteen feet (15') high. There shall be no
limit to the number of national and state flags flown, poles for which can also
be up to forty feet (40') in height and also can vary in circumference and
diameter. With the exception of national and state flags, which may be located
anywhere on a lot, all flags shall be located at an entrance to the Dahle CSD
from a public road or else be located close, within twenty feet (20') or less,
to the facade of the building. Flags and banners shall not be counted as
monument or building signage.
E.   Compatibility: All signage shall be architecturally generally compatible
with the buildings in the Dahle CSD. Final design details shall be submitted
for administrative review and approval with the site plan submittal as provided
in procedures below. No exposed neon signage will be permitted. (Ord. 1020A, 8-
7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023; Ord. 1581, 5-16-2023)
9-18B-090: LOADING DOCK SCREENING:
Screening of all loading docks shall be sensitively treated. If no permanent
masonry wall is constructed to screen any docks, berms and more intensive
landscaping, including evergreens, shall be required. This does not apply to a
single dock used for customer delivery truck purposes only. Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein, the screening of the loading docks for the
major building may be limited to six feet (6') in height and may be placed in
the locations identified in section
9-18B-110, exhibit D of this article. Loading docks may be angled differently
than shown on the exhibit. (Ord. 1020A, 8-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)
9-18B-100: PROCEDURES:
Commercial site plan approval for sites with buildings greater than one hundred
forty thousand (140,000) square feet within the Dahle CSD may be approved by
the zoning administrator and the city engineer with an administrative level
review, pending compliance with development standards described herein and all
other standard city requirements; provided, that future decorative, ornamental,
color, branding and similar modifications to such buildings greater than one
hundred forty thousand (140,000) square feet shall not require any
administrative or other city review and approval. Requests for waivers or
exceptions not specifically authorized with this Dahle CSD shall follow normal
resolution procedures, including planning commission or city council review, as
applicable. The approval of sites with buildings less than one hundred forty
thousand (140,000) square feet shall follow standard commercial site plan
approval procedures, through the planning commission. All other procedural

(28) acres, located along Draper City's major commercial corridor, 12300 South
between approximately 400 East and 615 East (see section
9-18E-090, exhibit A of this article). The size of the property allows for a
master planned, mixed use project with commercial uses along 12300 South, while
the depth of the property lends itself to residential on the north. An
understanding of the Draper City general plan's goals and objectives are
reflected in the overall district elements, such as land use, architecture
(commercial and residential), signage, site design, and landscape standards.
The Commercial District of the master plan aims to broaden the commercial tax
base of the City while providing commercial amenities to the City residents and
visitors alike, while the Residential District will provide a transition from
the more intense land uses on 12300 South to the less intense, medium density
residential neighborhood to the north. Also, the Residential District will help
support the existing retail along the 12300 South corridor. (Ord. 1371, 2-19-

other architectural elements utilizing the same materials and character
throughout. All signs must be reviewed and approved by the Day Dairy
Architectural Control Committee. In order to direct potential patrons to
specific businesses, and to mitigate possible confusion, monument displays
directional signage shall be allowed at multiple locations throughout the
interior of the property. Allowed signage shall include:
A.   Two (2) pole signs on the 12300 South project frontage.
1.   Sign 1, as shown in section
9-18E-090, exhibit E of this article, shall be located near the central entry.
Sign 2, as shown in section
9-18E-090, exhibit E of this article, shall be located near the 450 East street
entrance.

sign 1 shall conform to the clear view area requirements in the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) publication,
"A Policy On Geometric Design of Highways and Streets". Since sign 2 is located
in a more traditional location at the corner of the property, the clear view
triangulation shall be calculated as outlined in this Code.
6.   Pole signs may incorporate electronic message displays, provided the
display complies with section
9-26-090 of this title;
B.   A monument sign is allowed for each pad building along 450 East and one
along 12300 South. Monument signs shall also be allowed at each ingress point
into the property, except for those ingress points which contain a pole sign.
Entranceway monument signs shall be for Day Dairy and tenants with no street
frontage. All monument signs shall not exceed seven feet (7') in overall height
and have a minimum front setback of ten feet (10'), which includes the ten foot
(10') public utility easement. All monument signs shall have a uniform,
architecturally compatible design consistent with the Day Dairy design theme
with faces not larger than thirty two (32) square feet. Clear view triangles
for all monument signs shall conform to this Code;

areas of the property. Signs shall not exceed four feet (4') in height and
shall have a sign area of four (4) square feet maximum. Signs can either be
nonilluminated or internally illuminated. Due to the size and nature of the
directional signs, while being subject to the setback requirements, they will
not be subject to the clear view triangle requirements. Signs will be designed
to use materials and design techniques similar to pole and monument signs
through the property, per section
9-18E-090, exhibit E of this article. (Ord. 1371, 2-19-2019)
9-18E-080: PROCEDURES:

9-18G-050: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The LPCSD provides design guidelines for the buildings, landscaping, parking,
lighting and signage located within the district boundaries. The LPCSD is a
master planned mixed use development containing approximately one hundred (100)
acres of developed and undeveloped land along the 12300 South arterial and Lone
Peak Parkway arterial corridors. The schematic site plan of the LPCSD is
depicted in section
9-18G-090, exhibit A of this article. The master plan provides for various
potential retail, office and industrial development uses in designated areas of
the LPCSD in accordance with the development standards set forth in this
section. The conceptual locations of these potential uses are depicted in
section
9-18G-090, exhibit A-1 of this article. The retail phase is located on the
north side of 12300 South. This phase has two (2) pad sites, plus an existing
retail building of approximately sixteen thousand three hundred (16,300) square
feet. The master planned park may also include office uses incorporated into
the retail or industrial phases of the LPCSD so long as they adhere to the use
and design guidelines established herein. North of the retail phase there are
currently five (5) office and warehouse buildings totaling approximately one
hundred ninety two thousand (192,000) square feet. At approximately 12050 South
Lone Peak Parkway there exists one 285,000-square foot manufacturing building
which building, together with the related parcel, shall be referred to herein
as the "manufacturing building" and one 102,000-square foot warehouse building
which building, together with the related parcel, shall be referred to herein

The Draper Pointe Mixed Use Commercial Special District contains approximately
76.71 acres, as seen in section 9-18H-100, exhibit A of this article. It is
bordered by 200 West on the east, Galena Park Boulevard on the north and
Bangerter Highway on the south. The 13490 South Street runs through the
project. The size of the property allows for a master planned, mixed use
project, with land uses such as office, residential, general commercial,
including retail shops, and a hotel, personal and business services, and
office/warehouse. The Draper City general plan's goals and objectives are
reflected in the overall design of the project, by incorporating a mix of land
uses, quality architecture, efficient site design and abundant landscaping. The
Commercial District of the master plan aims to broaden the commercial tax base
of the City while providing amenities to the City residents, such as an
improved Galena Park Boulevard, 13490 South and Vista Station Boulevard, and
pedestrian access to Utah Transit Authority FrontRunner Station. The
Residential District will provide needed support for the retail and office in
the surrounding areas and the hotel will in turn support the office/business
uses. (Ord. 1155, 5-26-2015; amd. Ord. 1651, 5-20-2025)

measured at the distance based on the formula of square root of area of sign
times one hundred (100). Light cutoff devices shall minimize light above the
sign.
(3)   The illuminance of an EMC shall be measured with an illuminance meter set
to measure foot-candles accurate to at least two (2) decimals. Illuminance
shall be measured with the EMC off, and again with the EMC displaying a white
image. All measurements shall be taken perpendicular to the face of the EMC at
the distance determined by the total square footage of the EMC as set forth in
this subsection.
(4)   The applicant shall submit a photometric matrix (showing the dispersal in
foot-candles) showing that the sign meets all the requirements of this Code.
(5)   The owner shall be required to submit written certification from the sign
manufacturer that the light intensity shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified above and photocell dimming prior to the issuance of a sign permit.

9-18I-010: PURPOSE:
The White Mountain business district commercial special district (CSD-WMBD) is
an area 38.68 acres in size, located with frontage along what is planned to
become Lone Peak Parkway. The area is characterized by large vacant parcels
with a secondary access point on Golden Harvest Road and to major city
transportation corridors. Given the site's prominence, the city anticipates a
substantial employment and business presence within the CSD-WMBD that forwards
the community's economic development goals. With its high level of visibility
to residents and visitors alike, architectural integrity and quality design
controls are crucial to implementing the city's goals and objectives. The area
is commonly known as the White Mountain business district. The White Mountain
business district is a master planned project with multiple architecturally
compatible buildings fronting along Lone Peak Parkway, one of Draper City's
major commercial/industrial corridors. The project will incorporate the
community's design goals for commercial, industrial and retail developments in
all aspects. (Ord. 1130, 10-7-2014)

9-19-030: APPLICABILITY:
The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to all lands in Draper
City. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-040: RESPONSIBILITY FOR GEOLOGIC HAZARD STUDIES:
Geologic hazard studies often involve both engineering geology and geotechnical
engineering. Engineering geologic studies shall be performed under the direct
supervision of a qualified engineering geologist. Geotechnical engineering
studies shall be performed under the direct supervision of a qualified
geotechnical engineer. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-050: MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF THE GEOLOGIST:
Engineering geology and the evaluation of geologic hazards is a specialized
discipline within the practice of geology requiring technical expertise and
knowledge of techniques not commonly used in other geologic investigations.
Therefore, geologic hazard investigations involving engineering geologic
studies shall only be accepted by Draper City when conducted and signed by a
qualified engineering geologist. The minimum qualifications of the engineering
geologist who performs geologic hazard investigations are:
A.   An undergraduate or graduate degree in geology, engineering geology, or
geological engineering, or closely related field, from an accredited college or
university;
B.   Five (5) full years of experience in a responsible position in the field
of engineering geology in Utah, or in a state with similar geologic hazards and
regulatory environment. This experience must demonstrate the engineering
geologist's knowledge and application of appropriate techniques in performing
geologic hazard studies; and
C.   A Utah state professional geologist's license. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-060: MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ENGINEER:
Evaluation and mitigation of geologic hazards often require contributions from
a qualified geotechnical engineer, particularly in the design of mitigation
measures. Geotechnical engineering is a specialized discipline within the
practice of civil engineering requiring technical expertise and knowledge of
techniques not commonly used in civil engineering investigations. Therefore,
geologic hazard investigations requiring contributions from a qualified
geotechnical engineer will only be accepted by Draper City when also signed and
sealed by a qualified geotechnical engineer. Minimum qualifications of the
geotechnical engineer who participates in geologic hazard investigations are:
A.   A graduate degree in civil engineering, with an emphasis in geotechnical
engineering; or a B.S. degree in civil engineering with twelve (12) semester
hours of post-B.S. credit in geotechnical engineering, or course content
related to evaluation of geologic hazards, from an accredited college or
university;
B.   Five (5) full years of experience in a responsible position in the field
of geotechnical engineering in Utah, or in a state with similar geologic
hazards and regulatory environment, and experience demonstrating the engineer's
knowledge and application of appropriate techniques in participating in
geologic hazard studies; and
C.   A Utah state professional engineer's license. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-070: PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES:
A.   Development Improvements: This section shall apply to any geologic hazard
investigation for the purpose of determining the feasibility of development or
for the purpose of exploring, evaluating or establishing locations for
permanent improvements.
B.   Scoping Meeting: The developer or consultant shall schedule a scoping
meeting with the city to evaluate the engineering geologist/geotechnical
engineer's investigative approach. At this meeting, the consultant shall
present a work plan that includes locations of anticipated geologic hazards and
locations of proposed exploratory excavations, such as trenches, borings, and
CPT soundings, which meet the minimum standard of practice. The investigation
approach should allow for flexibility due to unexpected site conditions. Field
findings may require modifications to the work plan. Upon completion of a
successful scoping meeting, a land disturbance permit application may be
submitted to Draper City.
C.   Land Disturbance Permit: As required by title 18 of this code and except
as otherwise noted therein, no person shall commence or perform any land
disturbance, grading, relocation of earth, or any other land disturbance
activity, without first obtaining a land disturbance permit. Application for a
land disturbance permit shall be filed with the city engineer on forms
furnished by the city for such purposes only after a scoping meeting has taken
place.
D.   Responsible Contact: The applicant shall specify a primary contact
responsible for coordination with the city during the land disturbance
activity. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-080: GEOLOGIC HAZARDS STUDY AREA MAPS:
A.   Geologic hazards study area maps are prepared using the best available
scientific information but are necessarily generalized and designed only to
indicate areas where hazards may exist and where geologic hazards studies are
required. Because the geologic hazards study area maps are prepared at a
nonsite specific scale, hazards may exist that are not shown on the geologic
hazards study area maps. The fact that a site is not in a geologic hazards
study area for a particular hazard does not exempt the applicant from
considering the hazard if evidence is found that it may exist. If it is
subsequently determined that the site has geologic hazards that are not shown
on the geologic hazards study area maps, the review process will be pursuant to
this chapter.
B.   Geologic hazards study area boundaries shown on the maps will not be
systematically adjusted as each individual site specific study indicates
whether or not an actual hazard exists at a site because geologic hazards study
area maps are meant only to indicate where scientific evidence indicates a
hazard may exist. However, geologic hazards study area maps may be updated and
amended by the city if found to be inaccurate or in error, or as new methods or
data are developed to better define areas of potential hazards.
C.   Where geologic hazards study area maps are thought by an applicant to be
inaccurate or in error and require revision, the applicant shall submit to the
city technical evidence by a qualified professional supporting the claim and
showing the proposed revision. The city will review the information and render
a decision. The applicant may appeal that decision to the city council. (Ord.
935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-090: GEOLOGIC HAZARD STUDIES AND REPORTS REQUIRED:
Any applicant requesting development approval on a parcel of land within a
geologic hazard study area or where there are known or readily apparent
geologic hazards and the area is not depicted on the geologic hazards study
area maps, shall submit to the city two (2) paper copies and one electronic

recommended in the report are appropriate and adequate. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)
9-19-110: REVIEW OF GEOLOGIC HAZARD REPORTS:
A.   Scope: The city shall review any proposed land use which requires
preparation of a geologic hazards report under this chapter to determine the
possible risks to the safety of persons, property and city infrastructure from
geologic hazards.
B.   Submittal: Prior to consideration of any request for preliminary plat
approval or site plan approval, the geologic hazards report, if required, shall
be submitted to the city for review.
C.   Time Frame For Review: The city will complete each review in a reasonable
time frame, not to exceed forty five (45) days.
D.   Costs Borne By Applicant: All direct costs associated with the review of
geologic hazard studies shall be paid by the applicant.
E.   Records: The city shall retain a copy of each geologic report in the
planning division project file.
F.   Standards: The city shall determine whether the report complies with all
of the following standards:
1.   A suitable geologic hazard report has been prepared by qualified
professionals.
2.   The proposed land use does not present an unreasonable risk to the health,
safety, and welfare of persons or property, including buildings, storm drains,
public streets, culinary water facilities, utilities or critical facilities,
whether off site or on site, or to the aesthetics and natural functions of the
landscape, such as slopes, streams or other waterways, drainage, or wildlife
habitat, whether off site or on site, because of the presence of geologic
hazards or because of modifications to the site due to the proposed land use.
3.   The proposed land use demonstrates that, consistent with the state of the
practice, the identified geologic hazards can be mitigated to a level where the
risk to human life and damage to property are reduced to an acceptable and
reasonable level in a manner which will not violate applicable federal, state,
or local statutes, ordinances or regulations. Mitigation measures should
consider, in their design, the intended aesthetic functions of other governing
ordinances, such as the sensitive lands overlay zone. The applicant must
include with the geologic hazards report a mitigation plan that defines how the
identified hazards or limitations will be addressed without impacting or
adversely affecting off site areas. Mitigation measures must be reasonable and
practical to implement especially if such measures require ongoing maintenance
by property owners.
G.   Additional Requirements: The city may set other requirements as are
necessary to overcome any geologic hazards and to ensure that the purposes of
this chapter are met. These requirements may include, but are not limited to:
1.   Additional or more detailed studies to understand or quantify the hazard
or determine whether mitigation measures recommended in the report are
adequate;

protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Draper City, protect
Draper City's infrastructure and financial health, and minimize potential
adverse effects of geologic hazards to public health, safety, and property as a
condition of approval of any development which requires a geologic hazards
report.
I.   On Site Professional; Final Inspection: Draper City may require a
qualified professional be on site, at the cost of the developer, during certain
phases of construction, particularly during grading phases and the construction
of retaining walls. For any real property with respect to which development has
proceeded on the basis of a geologic or geotechnical report which has been
accepted by the city, no final inspection shall be completed or certificate of

this chapter only after the city has issued a written review of a report, and
shall set forth the specific grounds or issues upon which the appeal is based.
The appeal shall be submitted in writing to the director of community
development within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the written review or
other decision. The city shall assemble a professional panel of three (3)
qualified experts to serve as the appeal authority for any technical dispute.
The panel shall consist of an expert designated by the city, an expert
designated by the applicant, and an expert chosen by the city's and the
applicant's designated experts. If the city's and the applicant's designated
experts cannot reach a consensus of the third expert within thirty (30) days,
the city shall select the third expert. Decisions of the panel will be binding
and will be based on the majority decision of the panel. The costs of the
appeal process shall be paid by the applicant. (Ord. 935, 6-1-2010)

9-19-161-2: APPENDIX B, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SURFACE FAULT RUPTURE HAZARD
STUDIES:
1.0   INTRODUCTION
The Wasatch Fault Zone (WFZ) is a major tectonic feature in the western United
States, extending for about 230 miles from near Fayette, Utah at the south to
near Malad, Idaho at the north. Surface faulting has occurred along the WFZ in
northern Utah throughout late Pleistocene and Holocene time (Lund, 1990; Black
and others, 2003). "Surface faulting" is fault-related offset or displacement
of the ground surface that may occur in an earthquake.
The WFZ consists of a series of normal-slip fault segments with relative
movement down to the west and up to the east. Ten major fault segments are
recognized along the WFZ (Machette and others, 1992), which are believed to be
independent in regard to their potential for surface faulting. These segments
have distinct geomorphic expression and are clearly visible on aerial
photographs.
In Salt Lake Valley, the WFZ is represented by the Salt Lake City segment which
extends for 23± miles along the eastern edge of the valley (Lund, 1990). A
portion of the Salt Lake City segment of the WFZ is present within the east
part of the City (Personius and Scott, 1992; Machette, 1992).
Repeated Holocene movement has been well documented along the Salt Lake City
segment. Studies along Wasatch Boulevard near the mouth of Little Cottonwood
Canyon and at South Fork Dry Creek indicate at least four major earthquake
events in the last 6,000 years (Black and others, 2003).
If a fault were to break the ground surface beneath a building, significant
damage could occur, perhaps resulting in injuries or loss of life. To reduce
risk from surface-fault-rupture hazards and to protect public health and
safety, the City has defined Surface-Fault-Rupture Special Study Areas,
Quaternary faults located within the Surface-Fault-Rupture Special Study Areas
should be considered active until proven otherwise.
To ensure that buildings are not sited across Holocene-age (active) faults, the
Draper City Geologic Hazards Ordinance (Article 4, chapter 9-19 of the Draper
City Municipal Code) requires a site-specific geologic investigation of the
portion of the property situated within the Surface-Fault-Rupture Special Study
Area. The primary purposes of the geologic investigation are to assess the
surface fault rupture potential of the property and to assess the suitability
of the property for the proposed development from the standpoint of surface
fault rupture. If a fault is discovered and determined (or presumed) to be
Holocene- age (i.e., "active"), appropriate building setbacks from the fault
are required such that structures are not located astride the fault trace.
Building setbacks must be established prior to development of sites located
within the Surface-Fault-Rupture Special Study Area.
A site-specific surface-fault-rupture-hazard study includes a field
investigation (usually involving the excavation and geologic documentation of a
trench) and report. This appendix describes the minimum standards required by
the City for surface- fault-rupture-hazard studies.
The purpose of establishing minimum standards for surface fault rupture hazard
studies is to:
(a)   Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of surface fault rupture and related
hazards;
(b)   Assist property owners and land developers within the Surface-Fault-
Rupture Special Study Area in conducting reasonable and adequate studies;
(c)   Provide consulting engineering geologists with a common basis for
preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and recommending setbacks; and,
(d)   Provide an objective framework for review of fault study report.
The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide the developer and
consulting engineering geologist with an outline of appropriate exploration
methods, standardized report information, and expectations of the City.
These standards constitute the minimum level of effort required in conducting
surface-fault-rupture-hazard special studies in the City. Considering the
complexity of evaluating surface and near- surface faults, additional effort
beyond the minimum standards may be required at some sites to adequately
address the fault hazard. The information presented herein does not relieve the
engineering geologist from his/her duty to perform additional geologic or
engineering services he/she believes are necessary to assess the fault rupture
potential at a site.

1.2   Properties Requiring a Fault Investigation
A fault study is required, prior to approval of any land use, for properties
situated within Surface Fault Rupture Study Areas, as shown on the Surface
Fault Rupture Study Area map (Plate A-1). This map identifies known active
faults in the City, and defines special study areas where site-specific
geologic investigations are required. Development of any parcel within a
Surface Fault Rupture Study Areas requires submittal and review of a site-
specific fault study prior to receiving a land use or building permit from the
City. It is the responsibility of the applicant to retain a qualified
engineering geologist to perform the fault study (see Draper City Geologic
Hazards Ordinance 9-19).
In addition, a fault investigation may be required if on site or nearby fault-
related features not shown on the Surface Fault Rupture Study Area map are
identified during the course of other geologic or geotechnical studies
performed on or near the site or during construction.
2.0   MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR FAULT STUDIES
Following are the minimum standards for a comprehensive fault investigation.
Fault investigations may be reported in conjunction with other geological and
geotechnical investigations, or may be submitted separately. See Draper City
Geologic Hazards Ordinance (9-19) for supplemental requirements.
2.1   Scoping Meeting
The developer's consultant must schedule a scoping meeting with the City to
evaluate the fault investigation approach. At this meeting, the consultant
should present a site plan that includes: proposed building locations (if
known); expected fault location(s) and orientation; and the proposed trench
locations, orientation, length, and depth (see section 2.3, Fault Investigation
Method). The investigative approach should allow for flexibility due to
unexpected site conditions; field findings may require modifications to the
work plan.
2.2   Fault Investigation Method
Inherent in fault study methods is the assumption that future faulting will
recur along pre-existing faults and in a manner consistent with past
displacement. The focus of fault investigations is therefore to accurately
locate existing faults. If faults are documented, the investigation shall also
1) evaluate the age of movement along the fault trace(s), and 2) estimate
amounts of past displacement, which is required in order to derive fault
setbacks.
2.2.1   Previous Studies and Aerial Photograph Review
A fault investigation shall include review of available literature pertinent to
the site and vicinity, including previous published and unpublished geologic/
soils reports, and interpretation of available stereo-paired aerial
photographs. The photographs reviewed should include more than one set and
should include pre-urbanization aerial photographs, if available. Efforts must
be made to accurately plot the locations of mapped or inferred fault traces on
the property as shown by previous studies in the area.
2.2.2   Exploration Methods
Subsurface exploration consisting of trenching is required. The engineering
geologist shall clean and document ("log") trench exposures as described in
section 2.3.5. Existing faults may also be identified and mapped in the field
by direct observation of young, fault-related geomorphic features, and by
examination of aerial photographs. When trenching is not feasible (i.e., the
presence of shallow ground water, excessive thickness of fill, etc.),
supplemental methods such as closely spaced Cone Penetration Test (CPT)
soundings may be employed. Such supplemental methods must be discussed with the
City prior to implementation and should be clearly described in the report.
In lieu of conventional trenching or the CPT method, an alternative subsurface
exploration program may be acceptable, depending upon site conditions. Such a
program may consist of a sufficient number of closely spaced downhole-logged
bucket-auger borings, geophysical exploration techniques, or a combination of
techniques.
When an alternative exploration program is proposed, a written description of
the proposed exploration program along with an exploration plan should be
submitted to the City for review, prior to the exploration. The plan must
include, at a minimum, a map of suitable scale showing the site limits, surface
geologic conditions within several thousand feet of the site boundary, the
location and type of the proposed alternative subsurface exploration, and the
anticipated earth materials present at depth on the site.
The actual subsurface exploration program to be used on any specific parcel
will be determined on an individual basis, considering the current state of
technical knowledge about the fault zone and information gained from previous
exploration on adjacent or nearby parcels. At all times, consideration must be
given to safety, and trenching should comply with all applicable safety
regulations.
2.2.3   Trench Siting
Exploratory trenches must be oriented approximately perpendicular to the
anticipated trend of known fault traces. The trenches shall provide the minimum
footage of trenching necessary to explore the portion of the property situated
in the surface- fault-rupture special study area, such that the potential for
surface fault rupture may be adequately assessed. When trenching to determine
if faults might affect a proposed building site, the trench should extend
beyond the building footprint at least the minimum setback distance for the
building type (see
Table A-1).
Test pits or potholes alone are neither adequate nor acceptable. In some
instances more than one trench may be required to cover the entire building
area, particularly if the proposed development involves more than one building.
Where feasible, trenches shall be located outside the proposed building
footprint, as the trench is generally backfilled without compaction, which
could lead to differential settlement beneath the footings. Supplemental
trenching may be required in order to: 1) further refine fault locations (or
the absence thereof); 2) accurately define building restriction areas, and/or;
3) provide additional exposures for evaluating the age of movement along fault
traces.
2.2.4   Location Determination
All trenches and fault locations must be surveyed by a registered professional
land surveyor. Fault locations should be surveyed with an accuracy of about 0.1
foot or better, so that structural setbacks can be developed.
2.2.5   Depth of Excavation
The depth of the trenches will ultimately depend on the trench location,
occurrence of ground water, stability of subsurface deposits, and the geologic
age of the subsurface geologic units. As a minimum, however, trenches shall
extend substantially below the A and B soil horizons and well into distinctly
bedded Pleistocene-age materials, if possible. Where possible, the trenches
should extend below Holocene deposits and should expose contacts between
Holocene materials and the underlying older materials.
Appropriate safety measures pertaining to trench safety for ingress, egress,
and working in or in the vicinity of the trench must be implemented and
maintained. It is the responsibility of the person in the field directing
trench excavation to ensure that fault trenches are excavated in compliance
with current Occupational Safety and Health Administration excavation safety
regulations.
Trench backfilling methods and procedures should be documented in order to
establish whether additional corrective excavation, backfilling, and compaction
should be performed at the time of site grading.
In cases where Holocene (i.e., active) faults may be present, but pre-Holocene
deposits are below the practical limit of excavation, the trenches must extend
at least through sediments that are clearly older than several fault recurrence
intervals. The practical limitations of the trenching must be acknowledged in
the report and recommendations must reflect resulting uncertainties.
2.2.6   Documenting Trench Exposures
Trench walls shall be cleaned of debris and backhoe smear prior to
documentation. Trench logs shall be carefully drawn in the field at a minimum
scale of 1-inch equals 5-feet (1:60) following standard and accepted fault
trench investigation practices. Vertical and horizontal control must be used
and shown on trench logs. Trench logs must document all significant geologic
information from the trench and should graphically represent the geologic units
observed; see section 2.6.3(E). The strike, dip, and net vertical displacement
(or minimum displacement) of faults must be noted.
2.2.7   Age Dating
The engineering geologist shall interpret the ages of geologic units exposed in
the trench. When necessary, radiocarbon or other age determinations methods
shall be used. If evidence of faulting is documented, efforts shall be made to
date the time of latest movement (to determine whether recent (Holocene)
displacement has occurred) using appropriate geologic and/or soil stratigraphic
dating techniques. When necessary, obtain radiocarbon or other age
determinations. If soil stratigraphic dating techniques are used, a geologist
experienced in using the techniques and soil- development rates in the area
should perform them.
Many of the surficial deposits within Salt Lake Valley were deposited during
the last pluvial lake cycle, referred to as the Bonneville lake cycle. Although
late-stage Bonneville lake cycle sediments do not correspond to the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary (i.e., Bonneville lake cycle deposits are older
than 10,000 years old), for purposes of evaluating fault activity, these
deposits provide a useful regional datum (particularly so when the entire
Holocene sequence of sediments is not present).
For practical purposes, and due to documented Holocene displacement along the
Salt Lake segment of the Wasatch fault, any fault which displaces late-stage
Bonneville Lake Cycle deposits should be considered active unless the
Bonneville deposits are overlain by clearly unfaulted early Holocene-age
deposits. Conversely, the presence of demonstrably unbroken, undeformed, and
stratigraphically continuous Bonneville sediments constitutes reasonable
geologic evidence for the absence of active faulting.
2.3   Field Review
A field review by the City is required during exploratory trenching. The
applicant must provide a minimum of 48-hours notice to schedule the field
review with the City. The trenches should be open, safe, cleaned, and a
preliminary log completed at the time of the review. The field review allows
the City to evaluate the subsurface data (i.e., age and type of sediments;
presence/absence of faulting, etc.) with the consultant. Discussions about
questionable features or an appropriate setback distance are encouraged, but
the City will not help log the trench, explain the stratigraphy, or give verbal
approval of the proposed development during the field review.
2.4   Recommendations for Fault Setbacks
To address wide discrepancies in fault setback recommendations, the City has
adopted the fault setback calculation methodology for normal faults of Batatian
and Nelson (1999) and Christenson and others (2003). The consultant should use
this method to establish the recommended fault setback for critical facilities
and structures designed for human occupancy. If another fault setback method is
used, the consultant must provide justification in the report for the method
used. Faults and fault setbacks must be clearly identified on site plans and
maps.
Minimum setbacks are based on the type and occupancy of the proposed structures
(see
Table A-1). A setback should be calculated using the formulas presented below,
and then compared to the minimum setback established in
Table A-1. The greater of the two shall be used as the setback. Minimum
setbacks apply to both the hanging wall and footwall blocks.
Top of slope and/or toe of slope setbacks required by the local Building Code
must also be considered; again, the greater setback must be used.
Downthrown Fault Block (Hanging Wall)
The fault setback for the downthrown block will be calculated using the
following formula: S = U (2D + F/tan) where:
 
S = Setback within which structures for human occupancy are not permitted;
U = Criticality Factor, based on the proposed occupancy of the structure (see
    Table A-1)
D = Expected fault displacement per event (assumed to be equal to the net
    vertical displacement measured for each past event)
F = Maximum depth of footing or subgrade portion of the building
  = Dip of the fault (degrees)
 
Upthrown Fault Block (Footwall)
The dip of the fault and depth of the subgrade portion of the structure are
irrelevant in calculating the setback on the upthrown fault block. Therefore,
the setback for the upthrown side of the fault will be calculated as:
S = U x 2D
The setback is measured from the portion of the building closest to the fault,
whether subgrade or above grade. Minimum setbacks apply as discussed above.
2.5   Small Displacement Faults
Small-displacement faults are not categorically exempt from setback
requirements. Some faults having less than 4 inches (100 mm) of displacement
("small displacement faults") may be exempt from setback requirements.
Specific structural risk-reduction options such as foundation reinforcement may
be acceptable for some small-displacement faults in lieu of setbacks.
Structural options must minimize structural damage.
Fault studies must still identify faults and fault displacements (both net
vertical displacements and horizontal extension across the fault or fault
zone), and consider the possibility that future displacement amounts may exceed
past amounts. If structural risk-reduction measures are proposed for small
displacement faults, the following criteria must be addressed:
(a)   Reasonable geologic data indicating that future surface displacement
along the particular fault will not exceed 4 inches.
(b)   Specific structural mitigation to minimize structural damage.
(c)   A structural engineer must provide appropriate designs and the City shall
review the designs.
2.6   Required Outline for Surface Fault Rupture Hazard Studies
The information described herein may be presented as a separate surface-fault-
rupture-potential report or it may be incorporated within other geology or
engineering reports that may be required for the property.
The report shall contain a conclusion regarding the potential risk of surface
fault rupture on the subject property and a statement addressing the
suitability of the proposed development from a surface-fault-rupture-hazard
perspective. If exploration determines that there is a potential for surface
rupture due to faulting, or if gradational contacts or other uncertainties
associated with the exploration methods preclude the determination of absence
of small fault offsets, the report should provide estimates of the amplitude of
fault offsets that might affect habitable structures.
Surface-fault-rupture-hazard reports submitted to the City are expected to
follow the outline and address the subjects presented below. However,
variations in site conditions may require that additional items be addressed,
or permit some of the subjects to be omitted (except as noted).
2.6.1.   Report
(a)   Purpose and scope of work: The report shall contain a clear and concise
statement of the purpose of the investigation and the scope of work performed
for the investigation.
(b)   Geologic and tectonic setting: The report shall contain a clear and
concise statement of the general geologic and tectonic setting of the site
vicinity. The section should include a discussion of active faults in the area,
paleoseismicity of the relevant fault system(s), and should reference relevant
published and unpublished geologic literature.
(c)   Site description and conditions: The report shall include information on
geologic units, graded and filled areas, vegetation, existing structures, and
other factors that may affect site development, choice of investigative
methods, and the interpretation of data.
(d)   Methods of investigation:

concerning geologic units, faults, surface and ground water, and other factors.
(2)   Stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs to detect fault-related
topography, vegetation or soil contrasts, and other lineaments of possible
fault origin. Reference the photograph source, date, flightline numbers, and
scale. Salt Lake County has an excellent collection of stereoscopic aerial
photographs dating back to 1937 (including 1937, 1940, 1958, 1964, and 1985).
(3)   Observations of surface features, both on-site and off site, including
mapping of geologic and soil units; geomorphic features such as scarps,
springs, and seeps (aligned or not); faceted spurs, offset ridges or drainages;
and geologic structures. Locations and relative ages of other possible
earthquake-induced features such as sand blows, lateral spreads, liquefaction,
and ground settlement should be mapped and described. Slope failures, although
they may not be conclusively tied to earthquake causes, should also be noted.
(4)   Subsurface investigations: The report shall include a description of the
program of subsurface exploration, including trench logs, purpose of trench
locations, and a summary of trenching or other detailed, direct observation of
continuously exposed geologic units, soils, and geologic structures. All trench

The report must describe the criteria used to evaluate the ages of the deposits
encountered in the trench, and clearly evaluate the presence or absence of
active (Holocene) faulting.
(e)   Conclusions: Conclusions must be supported by adequate data and shall
contain, at a minimum:
(1)   Summary of data upon which conclusions are based.
(2)   Location of active faults, including orientation and geometry of faults,
amount of net slip along faults, anticipated future offset, and delineation of
setback areas.

data and appropriate reasoning behind each statement. Minimum recommendations
shall include:
(1)   Recommended setback distances per section 2.5. Supporting calculations
must be included. Faults and setbacks must be shown on site maps and final
recorded plat maps.
(2)   Other recommended building restrictions or use limitations (i.e.,
placement of detached garages, swimming pools, or other non-habitable
structures).
(3)   Need for additional or future studies to confirm buildings are not sited
across active faults, such as inspection of building footing or foundation
excavations by the consultant.
2.6.2.   Report References
Reports must include citations of literature and records used in the study,
referenced aerial photographs or images interpreted (air-photo source, date and
flight number, scale), and any other sources of data and information, including
well logs, personal communications, etc.
2.6.3.   Illustrations:
At a minimum, reports must include the following illustrations:
(a)   Location Map: A site location map depicting topographic and geographic
features and other pertinent data. Generally a 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic
base map will suffice.
(b)   Geologic Map: A regional-scale map (1:24,000 to 1:50,000 scale) is
generally adequate. Depending on site complexity, a site-scale geologic map (1
inch = 200 ft or more detailed) may also be necessary. The map should show
Quaternary and bedrock geologic units, faults, seeps or springs, soil or
bedrock slumps, and other geologic and soil features existing on and adjacent
to the project site. Geologic cross-sections may be included as needed to
illustrate 3-dimensional relationships.
(c)   Site Plan: A detailed site plan is required. The site plan should be at a
scale of at least 1 inch = 200 feet (or more detailed) and should clearly show
site boundaries, proposed building footprints, existing structures, streets,
slopes, drainages, exploratory trenches, boreholes, test pits, geophysical
traverses, and any other data pertinent data.
(d)   Site Specific Fault Map: If faulting is documented at a parcel, the
report shall include a site-specific fault map. The fault map should be at a
scale of at least 1 inch = 200 feet and should clearly show the surveyed
locations of trenches (and any other exploratory techniques), surveyed location
(s) of faults documented in the trenches, inferred location of the faults
between trenches, recommended fault setback distance on each side of the
faults, topographic contours, and proposed building locations, if known.
(e)   Exploratory Trench Logs: Trench logs are required for each trench
excavated as part of the study. Trench logs shall accurately depict all
observed geologic features and conditions. Trench logs shall not be generalized
or diagrammatic. The minimum scale is 1 inch = 5 feet (1:60) with no vertical
exaggeration. Trench logs must accurately reflect the features observed in the
trench (see section 2.3.6).
   Trench logs shall include: trench orientation and indication of which trench
wall was logged; trench top and bottom; stratigraphic contacts; stratigraphic
unit descriptions including lithology, USCS soil classification, genesis
(geologic origin), age, and contact descriptions; soil (pedogenic) horizons;
marker beds; and deformation or offset of sediments, faults, and fissures.
Other features of tectonic significance such as buried scarp free-faces,
colluvial wedges, in-filled soil cracks, drag folds, rotated clasts,
lineations, and liquefaction features including dikes, sand blows, etc. should
also be shown. Interpretations of the age and origin of the deposits and any
faulting or deformation must be included, based on depositional sequence. Fault
orientation and geometry (strike and dip), and amount of net displacement must
be measured and noted.
(f)   Exploratory boreholes and CPT soundings: Should boreholes or CPT
soundings be utilized as part of the investigation, reports shall include the
logs of the borings/soundings. Borehole logs must include lithology
descriptions, interpretations of geologic origin, USCS soil classification or
other standardized engineering soil classification (include an explanation of
the classification scheme), sample intervals, penetrative resistance values,
static ground-water depths and dates measured, total depth of borehole, and
identity of the person logging the borehole. Electronic copies of CPT data
files should be provided to the City's reviewer, upon request.
(g)   Geophysical data: All geophysical data, showing stratigraphic
interpretations and fault locations, must be included in the report, along with
correlations to trench or borehole logs to confirm interpretations.
(h)   Photographs: Photographs of scarps, trench walls, or other features that
enhance understanding of site conditions and fault-related conditions are not
required but should be included when deemed appropriate. Composited, rectified
digital photographs of trench walls may be used as background for trench logs,
but features as outlined in section F above must still be delineated.

9-19-161-3: APPENDIX C, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS:
1.0   INTRODUCTION
The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide consultants with a
general outline for performing quantitative slope stability analyses and to
clarify the expectations of Draper City. These standards constitute the minimum
level of effort required in conducting quantitative slope stability analyses in
Draper City. Considering the complexity inherent in performing slope stability
analyses, additional effort beyond the minimum standards presented herein may
be required at some sites to adequately address slope stability. The
information presented herein does not relieve consultants of their duty to
perform additional geologic or engineering analyses they believe are necessary
to assess the stability of slopes at a site.
The evaluation of landslides generally requires quantitative slope stability
analyses. Therefore, the standards presented herein are directly applicable to
landslide investigation, and also constitute the minimum level of effort when
performing landslide investigations. This appendix does not address debris
flows (see appendix E) or rock falls (see appendix F).
The purposes for establishing minimum standards for slope stability analyses
are to:
(a)   Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of unstable slopes and related
hazards;
(b)   Assist property owners and land developers in conducting reasonable and
adequate studies;
(c)   Provide consulting engineering geologists and geotechnincal engineers
with a common basis for preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and
mitigation; and,
(d)   Provide an objective framework for regulatory review of slope stability
reports.

1.2   Areas Requiring Slope Stability Analyses
Slope stability analyses shall be performed for all sites located within the
Slope Stability Study Area Map (Plate A-3) and for all slopes that may be
affected by the proposed development which meet the following criteria:
(a)   Cut and/or fill slopes steeper than about 2 horizontal (h) to 1 vertical
(v).
(b)   Natural slopes steeper than or equal to 3 horizontal (h) to 1 vertical
(v).
(c)   Natural and cut slopes with potentially adverse geologic conditions
(e.g., bedding, foliation, or other structural features that are potentially
adverse to the stability of the slope).
(d)   Natural and cut slopes which include a geologic hazard such as a
landslide, irrespective of the slope height or slope gradient.
(e)   Buttresses and stability fills.
(f)   Cut, fill, or natural slopes of water-retention basins or flood-control
channels.
(g)   In hillside areas (Plate A-3), investigations shall address the potential
for surficial instability, debris/mudflows (see Appendix E), rock falls (see
Appendix F), and soil creep on all slopes that may affect the proposed
development or be affected by the proposed development.
(h)   When evaluating site conditions to determine the need for slope stability
analyses, off-property conditions shall be considered (both up-slope to the top
(s) of adjacent ascending slopes and down-slope to and beyond the toe(s) of
adjacent descending slopes). Also, the consultant shall demonstrate that the
proposed hillside development will not affect adjacent sites or limit adjacent
property owners' ability to develop their sites.
1.3   Roles of Engineering Geologist and Engineering
The investigation of the static and seismic stability of slopes is an
interdisciplinary practice. To provide greater assurance that the hazards are
properly identified, assessed, and mitigated, involvement of both an
engineering geologist and geotechnical engineer is required. Analyses shall be
performed only by or under the direct supervision of licensed professionals,
qualified and competent in their respective area of practice. An engineering
geologist shall provide appropriate input to the geotechnical engineer with
respect to the potential impact of the geology, stratigraphy, and hydrologic
conditions on the stability of the slope. The shear strength and other
geotechnical earth material properties shall be evaluated by the geotechnical
engineer. Qualified engineering geologists, geological engineers and
geotechnical engineers may assess and quantitatively evaluate slope stability.
However, the geotechnical engineer shall perform all design stability
calculations. Ground motion parameters for use in seismic stability analysis
may be provided by either the engineering geologist or geotechnical engineer.
1.4   Minimum Qualifications of the Licensed Professional
Slope stability analyses must be performed by qualified engineering geologists
and qualified geotechnical engineers (see sections
9-19-050 and
9-19-060 of the Draper City Geologic Hazards Ordinance, chapter 9-19).
2.0   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Except for the derivation of the input ground motion for pseudostatic and
seismic deformation analyses (see section 12), slope stability analyses and
evaluations should be performed in general accordance with the latest version
of Recommended Procedures for Implementation of DMG Special Publication 117,
Guidelines for Analyzing and Mitigating Landslide Hazards in California (Blake
et al., 2002). Procedures for developing input ground motions to be used in
Draper City are described in section 12.1. See Draper City Geologic Hazard
Ordinance, chapter 9-19, for supplemental requirements.
3.0   SUBMITTALS
Submittals for review shall include boring logs; geologic cross sections;
trench and test pit logs; laboratory data (particularly shear strength test
results, including individual stress- deformation plots from direct shear
tests); discussions pertaining to how idealized subsurface conditions and shear
strength parameters used for analyses were developed; analytical results,
including computer output files (if requested); and summaries of the slope
stability analyses and conclusions regarding slope stability.
Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic
cross sections and must be utilized by the geotechnical engineer for the slope
stability analyses. If on-site sewage or storm water disposal exists or is
proposed, the slope stability analyses shall include the effects of the
effluent plume on slope stability.
The results of any slope stability analyses must be submitted with pertinent
backup documentation (i.e., calculations, computer output, etc.). Printouts of
input data, output data (if requested), and graphical plots must be submitted
for each computer-aided slope stability analysis. In addition, input data
files, recorded on diskettes, CDs, or other electronic media may be requested
to facilitate the City's review.
4.0   FACTORS OF SAFETY
The minimum acceptable static factor of safety is 1.5 for both gross and
surficial slope stability. The minimum acceptable factor of safety for a
calibrated pseudostatic analysis is 1.0 using the method of Stewart and others
(2003) (see section 12.2).
5.0   LANDSLIDES
The evaluation of landslides generally requires quantitative slope stability
analyses. Therefore, the standards presented herein are directly applicable to
landslide investigation, and also constitute the minimum level of effort when
performing landslide investigations. Evaluation of landslides shall be
performed in the preliminary phase of hillside developments. Where landslides
are present or suspected, sufficient subsurface exploration will be required to
determine the basic geometry and stability of the landslide mass and the
required stabilization measures. The depth of geologic exploration shall
consider the regional geologic structure, the likely failure mode of the
suspected failure, and past geomorphic conditions.
6.0   SITE INVESTIGATION AND GEOLOGIC STUDIES
Adequate evaluation of slope stability for a given site requires thorough and
comprehensive geologic and geotechnical engineering studies. These studies are
a crucial component in the evaluation of slope stability. Geologic mapping and
subsurface exploration are normal parts of field investigation. Samples of
earth materials are routinely obtained during subsurface exploration for
geotechnical testing in the laboratory to determine the shear strength
parameters and other pertinent engineering properties.
In general, geologic studies for slope stability consist of the following
fundamental phases:
(a)   Study and review of published and unpublished geologic information (both
regional and site specific).
(b)   Review and interpretation of available stereoscopic and oblique aerial
photographs, DEMs, and LiDAR.
(c)   Geologic field mapping, including, but not necessarily limited to,
measurement of bedding, foliation, fracture, and fault attitudes and other
parameters.
(d)   Documentation and evaluation of subsurface groundwater conditions
(including effects of seasonal and longer-term natural fluctuations as well as
landscape irrigation), surface water, on-site sewage disposal, and/or storm
water disposal.
(e)   Subsurface exploration.
(f)   Analysis of the geologic failure mechanisms that could occur at the site
(e.g., mode of failure and construction of the critical geologic cross
sections).
(g)   Presentation and analysis of the data, including an evaluation of the
potential impact of geologic conditions on the project.
Geologic/geotechnical reports shall demonstrate that each of these phases has
been adequately performed and that the information obtained has been considered
and logically evaluated. Minimum criteria for the performance of each phase are
described and discussed in Blake and others (2002).
7.0   SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION
The purpose of subsurface exploration is to identify potentially significant
geologic materials and structures at a site and to provide samples for detailed
laboratory characterization of materials from potentially critical zones.
Subsurface exploration is almost always required and may be performed by a
number of widely known techniques such as bucket-auger borings, conventional
small-diameter borings, cone penetration testing (CPT), test pits, trenches,
and/or geophysical techniques (see section 4.2 of Blake et al., 2002). A
discussion of the applicability of some subsurface exploration techniques
follows.
7.1   Trenching
Subsurface exploration consisting of trenching has proven, in some cases, to be
necessary when uncertainty exists regarding whether or not a particular
landform is a landslide. Care must be exercised with this exploration method
because landslides characteristically contain relatively large blocks of intact
geologic units, which in a trench exposure could give the false impression that
the geologic unit is "in-place." Although limited to a depth of about 15 feet
below existing grades, trenching has also proven to be a useful technique for
verifying margins of landslides, although the geometry of a landslide can
generally be readily determined from evaluation of stereoscopic aerial
photographs. Once a landslide is identified, conventional subsurface
exploration drilling techniques will be required (see section 7.2 and 7.3).
Slope stability analyses based solely on data obtained from trenches will not
be accepted.
7.2   Methods for Bedded Formations
Conventional subsurface exploration techniques involving continuous core
drilling with an oriented core barrel, test pits, and deep bucket-auger borings
may be used to assess the subsurface soil and geologic conditions, particularly
for geologic units with inclined bedding that includes weak layers.
Although not commonly utilized in Utah, a 24-inch-diameter bucket-auger-boring
with down-hole logging can provide valuable data (provided the consultant has
determined the drill hole is safe to enter). The evaluation of safety of the
proposed subsurface exploration program will be the responsibility of the
consultant.
Particular attention must be paid to the presence or absence of weak layers
(e.g., clay, claystone, silt, shale, or siltstone units) during the
exploration. Unless adequately demonstrated (through comprehensive and detailed
subsurface exploration) that weak (clay, claystone, silt, shale, or siltstone)
layers (even as thin as 1/16-inch or less) are not present, a weak layer shall
be assumed to possibly occur anywhere in the stratigraphic profile (i.e.,
ubiquitous weak clay beds).
The depth of the subsurface exploration must be sufficient to assess the
conditions at or below the level of the deepest potential failure surface
possessing a factor of 1.5 or less. A preliminary slope stability analysis may
need to be performed to assist in the planning of the subsurface exploration
program.
7.3   Other Geologic Units
For alluvium, fill materials, or other soil units that do not contain weak
interbeds, other exploration methods such as small- diameter borings (e.g.,
rotary wash or hollow-stem-auger) or cone penetration testing may be suitable.
8.0   SOIL PARAMETERS
Soil properties, including unit weight and shear strength parameters (cohesion
and friction angle), may be based on conventional field and laboratory tests as
well as on field performance. Where appropriate (i.e., for landslide slip
surfaces, along bedding planes, for surficial stability analyses, etc.),
laboratory tests for saturated, residual shear strengths must be performed.
Estimation of the shear resistance along bedding (or landslide) planes normally
requires an evaluation of saturated residual along-bedding-strength values of
the weakest interbedded (or slide-plane) material encountered during the
subsurface exploration, or in the absence of sufficient exploration, the
weakest material that may be present, consistent with site geologic conditions.
Strength parameters derived solely from CPT data may not be appropriate for
slope-stability analysis in some cases, particularly for strengths along
existing slip surfaces where residual strengths have developed. Additional
guidance on the selection of strength parameters for slope stability analyses
is contained in Blake et al. (2002).
8.1   Residual Shear Strength Parameters
Residual strength parameters may be determined using the direct shear or ring
shear testing apparatus; however ring shear tests are preferred. If performed
properly, direct shear test results may approach ring-shear test results. The
soil specimen must be subjected to a sufficient amount of deformation (e.g., a
significant number of shearing cycles in the direct shear test or a significant
amount of rotation in the ring shear test) to assure that residual strength has
been developed. In the direct- shear and ring-shear tests, stress-deformation
curves can be used to determine when a sufficient number of cycles of shearing
have been performed by showing that no further significant drop in shear
strength results with the addition of more cycles or more rotation. The stress-
deformation curves obtained during the shear tests must be submitted with the
other laboratory test results. It shall be recognized that for most clayey
soils, the residual shear strength envelope is curved and passes through the
origin (i.e., at zero normal stress there is zero shear strength). Any
"apparent shear strength" increases resulting from a non- horizontal shear
surface (i.e., ramping) or "bulldozing" in residual direct shear tests shall be
discounted in the interpretation of the strength parameters.
8.2   Interpretation
The engineer will need to use considerable judgment in the selection of
appropriate shear test methods and in the interpretation of the results to
develop shear strength parameters commensurate with slope stability conditions
to be evaluated. Scatter plots of shear strength data may need to be presented
to allow for assessment of idealized parameters. The report shall summarize
shear strength parameters used for slope stability analyses and describe the
methodology used to interpret test results and estimate those parameters.
Peak shear strengths may be used to represent across-bedding failure surfaces
or compacted fill, in situations where strength degradations are not expected
to occur (see guidelines in Blake et al., 2002). Where peak strengths cannot be
relied upon, fully softened (or lower) strengths shall be used.
Ultimate shear strength parameters shall be used in static slope stability
analyses when there has not been past deformation. Residual shear strength
parameters shall be used in static slope stability analyses when there has been
past deformation.
Averaged strength parameters may be appropriate for some across- bedding
conditions, if sufficient representative samples have been carefully tested.
Analyses for along-bedding or along- existing-landslide slip surfaces shall be
based on lower-bound interpretations of residual shear strength parameters and
comparison of those results to correlations, such as those of Stark and others
(2005).
8.3   Default Soil Parameters
In the Traverse Mountain area, failure surfaces for known landslides commonly
occur within the Tertiary volcanics. Those failure surfaces typically are along
clay layers formed by the in situ alteration of tuff deposits. In cases when
the failure surface has been sampled and tested, relatively low residual-
shear-strength values have been obtained; these values are cohesion equal to 0
psf and a friction angles equal to 11 to 12 degrees. Similar values have also
been reported from the Springhill landslide in North Salt Lake that is in a
similar tuffaceous volcanic formation of Tertiary age.
To assist in understanding shear strengths of these materials, the following
shear strength parameters for landslide failure surfaces and along weak layers
within the Tertiary volcanics shall be used; cohesion equal to 0 psf and a
friction angle equal to 11 degrees, unless otherwise demonstrated. If site-
specific testing produces lower residual shear strength than these values, the
site-specific test results should be used. If site-specific testing produces
higher values, documentation must be provided to demonstrate that the weakest
materials were retrieved and tested and that the materials retrieved truly
represent the basal landslide slip surface.
9.0   SOIL CREEP
The potential effects of soil creep shall be addressed where any proposed
structure is planned in close proximity to an existing fill slope or natural
slope. The potential effects on the proposed development shall be evaluated and
mitigation measures proposed, including appropriate setback recommendations.
Setback recommendations shall consider the potential affects of creep forces.
All reports in hillside areas shall address the potential for surficial
instability, debris/mudflow (Appendix E), rock falls (Appendix F), and soil
creep on all slopes that may affect the proposed development or be affected by
the proposed development. Stability of slopes along access roads shall be
addressed.
10.0   GROSS STATIC STABILITY
Gross stability includes rotational and translational deep-seated failures of
slopes or portions of slopes existing within or outside of but potentially
affecting the proposed development. The following guidelines, in addition to
those in the Blake and others (2002) document, shall be followed when
evaluating slope stability:
(a)   Stability shall be analyzed along cross sections depicting the most
adverse conditions (e.g., highest slope, most adverse bedding planes,
shallowest likely ground water table, and steepest slope). Often analyses are
required for different conditions and for more than one cross section to
demonstrate which condition is most adverse. When evaluating the stability of
an existing landslide, analyses must also address the potential for partial
reactivation. Inclinometers may be used to help determine critical failure
surfaces and, along with high-resolution GPS, the state of activity of existing
landslides. The critical failure surfaces on each cross-section shall be
identified, evaluated, and plotted on the large-scale cross section.
(b)   If the long-term, static factor of safety is less than 1.5, mitigation
measures will be required to bring the factor of safety up to the required
level or the project may be redesigned to achieve a minimum factor of safety of
1.5.
(c)   The temporary stability of excavations shall be evaluated and mitigation
measures shall be recommended as necessary to obtain a minimum factor of safety
of 1.3.
(d)   Long-term stability shall be analyzed using the highest known or
anticipated groundwater level based upon a groundwater assessment performed
under the requirements of section 6.0.
(e)   Where back-calculation is appropriate, shear strengths utilized for
design shall be no higher than the lowest strength computed using back
calculation. If a consultant proposes to use shear strengths higher than the
lowest back- calculated value, justification shall be required. Assumptions
used in back-calculations regarding pre-sliding topography and groundwater
conditions at failure must be discussed and justified.
(f)   Reports shall describe how the shear strength testing methods used are
appropriate in modeling field conditions and long-term performance of the
subject slope. The utilized design shear strength values shall be justified
with laboratory test data and geologic descriptions and history, along with
past performance history, if known, of similar materials.
(g)   Reports shall include shear strength test plots consisting of normal
stress versus shear resistance (failure envelope). Plots of shear resistance
versus displacement shall be provided for all residual and fully softened
(ultimate) shear tests.
(h)   The degree of saturation for all test specimens shall be reported. Direct
shear tests on partially saturated samples may grossly overestimate the
cohesion that can be mobilized when the material becomes saturated in the
field. This potential shall be considered when selecting shear strength
parameters. If the rate of shear displacement exceeds 0.005 inches per minute,
the consultant shall provide data to demonstrate that the rate is sufficiently
slow for drained conditions.
(i)   Shear strength values higher than those obtained through site-specific
laboratory tests generally will not be accepted.
(j)   If direct shear or triaxial shear testing is not appropriate to model the
strength of highly jointed and fractured rock masses, the design strengths
shall be evaluated in a manner that considers overall rock mass quality and be
consistent with rock mechanics practice.
(k)   Shear strengths used in slope stability analyses shall be evaluated
considering the natural variability of engineering characteristics inherent in
earth materials. Multiple shear tests on each site material are likely to be
required.
(l)   Direct shear tests do not always provide realistic strength values (Watry
and Lade, 2000). Correlations between liquid limit, percent clay fraction, and
strength (fully softened and residual) with published data (e.g., Stark and
McCone, 2002) shall be performed to verify tested shear strength parameters.
Strength values used in analyses that exceed those obtained by the correlation
must be appropriately justified.
(m)   Shear strengths for proposed fill slopes shall be evaluated using samples
mixed and remolded to represent anticipated field conditions. Confirming
strength testing may be required during grading.
(n)   Where bedding planes are laterally unsupported on slopes, potential
failures along the unsupported bedding planes shall be analyzed. Similarly,
stability analyses shall be performed where bedding planes form a dip-slope or
near-dip-slope using composite potential failure surfaces that consist of
potential slip surfaces along bedding planes in the upper portions of the slope
in combination with slip surfaces across bedding planes in the lower portions
of the slope.
(o)   The stability analysis shall include the effect of expected maximum
moisture conditions on soil unit weight.
(p)   For effective stress analyses, measured groundwater conditions adjusted
to consider likely unfavorable conditions with respect to anticipated future
groundwater levels, seepage, or pore pressure shall be included in the slope
stability analyses.
(q)   Tension crack development shall be considered in the analyses of
potential failure surfaces. The height and location of the tension crack shall
be determined by searching.
(r)   Anticipated surcharge loads as well as external boundary pressures from
water shall be included in the slope stability evaluations, as deemed
appropriate.
(s)   Analytical chart solutions may be used provided they were developed for
conditions similar to those being analyzed. Generally though, computer-aided
searching techniques shall be used, so that the potential failure surface with
the lowest factor of safety can be located. Examples of typical searching
techniques are illustrated on figures 9.1a through 9.1f in Blake and others
(2002). However, verification of the reasonableness of the analytical results
is the responsibility of the geotechnical engineer and/or engineering
geologist.
(t)   The critical potential failure surface used in the analysis may be
composed of circles, wedges, planes, or other shapes considered to yield the
minimum factor of safety most appropriate for the geologic site conditions. The
critical potential failure surface having the lowest factor of safety with
respect to shearing resistance must be sought. Both the lowest factor of safety
and the critical failure surface shall be documented.
11.0   SURFICIAL STABILITY OF SLOPES
Surficial slope stability refers to slumping and sliding of near- surface
sediments and is most critical during the snowmelt and rainy season or when
excessive landscape water is applied. The assessment of surficial slope
stability shall be based on analysis procedures for stability of an infinite
slope with seepage parallel to the slope surface or an alternate failure mode
that would produce the minimum factor of safety. The minimum acceptable depth
of saturation for surficial stability evaluation shall be four feet.
11.1   Applicability and Procedures
Conclusions shall be substantiated with appropriate data and analyses. Residual
shear strengths comparable to actual field conditions shall be used in
completing surficial stability analyses. Surficial stability analyses shall be
performed under rapid draw-down conditions where appropriate (e.g., for debris
and detention basins).
Where 2:1 or steeper slopes have soil conditions that can result in the
development of an infinite slope with parallel seepage, calculations shall be
performed to demonstrate that the slope has a minimum static factor of safety
of 1.5, assuming a fully saturated 4-foot thickness. If conditions will not
allow the development of a slope with parallel seepage, surficial slope
stability analyses may not be required (provided the geologic/geotechnical
reviewer concurs).
Surficial slope stability analyses shall be performed for fill, cut, and
natural slopes assuming an infinite slope with seepage parallel to the slope
surface or other failure mode that would yield the minimum factor of safety
against failure. A suggested procedure for evaluating surficial slope stability
is presented in Blake et al. (2002).
11.2   Soil Properties
Soil properties used in surficial stability analyses shall be determined as
noted in section 8.1. Residual shear strength parameters for surficial slope
stability analyses shall be developed for a stress range that is consistent
with the near- surface conditions being modeled. As indicated in section 8.1,
it shall be recognized that for most clayey soils, the residual shear strength
envelope is curved and passes through the origin (i.e., at zero normal stress
there is zero shear strength). For sites with deep slip surfaces, the
guidelines given by Blake and others (2002) should be followed.
11.3   Seepage Conditions
The minimum acceptable vertical depth for which seepage parallel to the slope
shall be applied is four feet for cut or fill slopes. Greater depths may be
necessary when analyzing natural slopes that have significant thicknesses of
loose surficial material.
12.0   SEISMIC SLOPE STABILITY
In addition to static slope stability analyses, slopes shall be evaluated for
seismic slope stability as well. Acceptable methods for evaluating seismic
slope stability using calibrated pseudo- static limit-equilibrium procedures
and simplified methods (e.g., those based on Newmark, 1965) to estimate
permanent seismic slope movements are summarized in Blake and others (2002).
Nonlinear, dynamic finite element/finite difference numerical methods also may
be used to evaluate slope movements resulting from seismic events as long as
the procedures, input data, and results are thoroughly documented, and deemed
acceptable by the City.
12.1   Ground Motion for Pseudostatic and Seismic Deformation Analyses
The two controlling faults that would most affect Draper City are the Salt Lake
City and Provo segments of the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ). Repeated Holocene
movement has been well documented along both segments (Black and others, 2003).
Studies along the Provo segment of the WFZ indicate a recurrence interval of
about 1150 years (Olig, and others, 2006; later revised, Olig, 2007) and the
most recent event being about 500 to 650 years ago (Black and others, 2003;
Olig, and others, 2006). Studies along the Salt Lake City segment of the WFZ
indicate a recurrence interval of about 1300 years and the most recent event
being about 1300 years ago (Lund, 2005). Based on the paleoseismic record of
the Salt Lake City segment and assuming a time-dependent model, McCalpin (2002)
estimates a conditional probability (using a log-normal renewal model) of 16.5%
in the next 100 years (8.25% in the next 50 years) for a M>7 surface-faulting
earthquake. Therefore, using a time-dependent rather than Poisson or random
model for earthquake recurrence, the likelihood of a large surface-faulting
earthquake on the Salt Lake City segment of the WFZ is relatively high and
therefore the Salt Lake City segment is considered the primary controlling
fault for deterministic analyses.
In regards to design ground accelerations for seismic slope- stability
analyses, Draper City prefers a probabilistic approach to determining the
likelihood that different levels of ground motion will be exceeded at a
particular site within a given time period. In order to more closely represent
the seismic characteristics of the WFZ and better capture this possible high
likelihood of a surface-faulting earthquake on the Salt Lake City segment,
design ground motion parameters for seismic slope stability analyses shall be
based on the peak accelerations with a 3.5 percent probability in 50 years
(1,400-year return period). Peak bedrock ground motions can be readily obtained
via the internet from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National
Seismic Hazard Maps, Data and Documentation web page (USGS, 2002), which is
based on Frankel and others (2002). PGAs obtained from the USGS (2002) web page
should be adjusted for effects of soil/rock (site-class) conditions in
accordance with Seed and others (2001). Site specific response analysis may
also be used to develop PGA values as long as the procedures, input data, and
results are thoroughly documented, and deemed acceptable by the City.
12.2   Pseudo-Static Evaluations
Pseudo-static methods for evaluating seismic slope stability are acceptable as
long as minimum factors of safety are satisfied, and due consideration is given
in the selection of the seismic coefficient, kh, reduction in material shear
strengths, and the factor of safety for pseudo-static conditions.
Pseudo-static seismic slope stability analyses can be performed using the
"screening analysis" procedure described in Blake et al. (2002). For that
procedure a kh-value is selected from seismic source characteristics (modal
magnitude, modal distance, and firm rock peak ground acceleration) and an
acceptable level of deformation (5 cm) is specified. For that procedure, a
factor of safety of 1.0 or greater is considered acceptable; otherwise, an
analysis of permanent seismic slope deformation shall be performed.
12.3   Permanent Seismic Slope Deformation
For seismic slope stability analyses, estimates of permanent seismic
displacement are preferred and may be performed using the procedures outlined
in Blake and others (2002). It should be noted that Bray and Rathje (1998),
referenced in Blake and others (2002), has been updated and superseded by Bray
and Travasarou (2007), which is the City's currently preferred method. For
those analyses, calculated seismic displacements shall be 5 cm or less, or
mitigation measures shall be proposed to limit calculated displacements to 5 cm
or less.
For specific projects, different levels of tolerable displacement may be
possible, but site-specific conditions, which shall include the following, must
be considered:
(a)   The extent to which the displacements are localized or broadly
distributed - broadly distributed shear deformations would generally be less
damaging and more displacement could be allowed.
(b)   The displacement tolerance of the foundation system - stiff, well-
reinforced foundations with lateral continuity of vertical support elements
would be more resistant to damage (and hence could potentially tolerate larger
displacements) than typical slabs-on-grade or foundation systems with
individual spread footings.
(c)   The potential of the foundation soils to experience strain softening -
slopes composed of soils likely to experience strain softening should be
designed for relatively low displacements if peak strengths are used in the
evaluation of ky due to the potential for progressive failure, which could
involve very large displacements following strain softening.
In order to consider a threshold larger than 5 cm, the project consultant shall
provide prior, acceptable justification to the City and obtain the City's
approval. Such justification shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
City, that the proposed project will achieve acceptable performance 1 .
13.0   WATER RETENTION BASINS AND FLOOD CONTROL CHANNELS
For cut, fill, or natural slopes of water-retention basins or flood-control
channels, slope stability analyses shall be performed. In addition to analyzing
typical static and seismic slope stability, those analyses shall consider the
effects of rapid drawdown, if such a condition could develop.
14.0   MITIGATION
When slope stability hazards are determined to exist on a project, measures to
mitigate impacts from those hazards shall be implemented. Some guidance
regarding mitigation measures is provided in Blake et al. (2002). Slope
stability mitigation methods include 1) hazard avoidance, 2) grading to improve
slope stability, 3) reinforcement of the slope or improvement of the soil
within the slope, and (4) reinforcement of the structure built on the slope to
tolerate anticipated slope displacements.
Where mitigation measures that are intended to add stabilizing forces to the
slope are to be implemented, consideration may need to be given to strain
compatibility. For example, if a compacted fill buttress is proposed to
stabilize laterally unsupported bedding or a landslide, the amount of
deformation needed to mobilize the recommended shear strength in the buttress
shall be considered to confirm that it will not result in adverse movements of
the upslope bedding or landslide deposits. Similarly, if a series of drilled
soldier piers is to be used to support a potentially unstable slope and a
residential structure will be built on the piers, pier deformations resulting
from movements needed to mobilize the soil's shear strength shall be compared
to tolerable deflections in the supported structure.
14.1   Full Mitigation
Full mitigation of slope stability hazards shall be performed for developments
in the City. Remedial measures that produce static factors of safety in excess
of 1.5 and acceptable seismic displacement estimates shall be implemented as
needed.
14.2   Partial Mitigation for Seismic Displacement Hazards
On some projects or portions thereof (such as small structural additions,
residential "infill projects", non-habitable structures, and non-structural
natural-slope areas), full mitigation of seismic slope displacements may not be
possible, due to physical or economic constraints. In those cases, partial
mitigation, to the extent that it prevents structural collapse, injury, and
loss of life, may be possible if it can be provided consistent with IBC
philosophies, and if it is approved by Draper City. The applicability of
partial mitigations to specific projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.
15.0   Notice of Geologic Hazard and Waiver of Liability
For developments where full mitigation of seismic slope displacements is not
implemented, a Notice of Geologic Hazard shall be recorded with the proposed
development describing the displacement hazard at issue and the partial
mitigation employed. The Notice shall clearly state that the seismic
displacement hazard at the site has been reduced by the partial mitigation, but
not totally eliminated.
In addition, the owner shall assume all risks, waive all claims against the
City and its consultants, and indemnify and hold the City and its consultants
harmless from any and all claims arising from the partial mitigation of the
seismic displacement hazard.

Notes
  1. The SP117 Guidelines Committee (Blake and others, 2002) struggled in its
  deliberations regarding this issue and was unable to reach unanimous
  consensus. However, it was the judgment of all but one of the committee
  members (14 out of the 15) that when the critical slip surface from slope
  stability analysis daylights within a structure that is likely to be occupied
  by people during an earthquake, and if calculated median displacements (u)
  can be maintained at less than 5 cm, it is unlikely that the building would
  be damaged sufficiently to significantly threaten its structural integrity.
  One of the committee members felt that the calculated median seismic
  displacements through occupied structures should be maintained at less than
  15 cm, but other than having that opinion, he did not offer a specific
  justification for that choice. Neither of those values (5 or 15 cm) is
  necessarily the "correct" median value, because they are judgment-based.
   
  Ideally, allowable displacements for analyses would be established from a
  database in which observed slope displacements from earthquakes are
  correlated to measures of damage in structures. Unfortunately, however, such
1 data do not exist in sufficient quantity to be useful, and hence there is an
  insufficient basis for selecting allowable displacements empirically.
  Accordingly, allowable displacement levels are established from engineering
  judgment. A number of factors affect the degree to which slope displacements
  will be damaging to structures. Displacements that occur beneath occupied
  structures are more critical than those in garden areas or streets.
  Displacements that occur abruptly across a narrow shear surface can be more
  damaging than those that are broadly distributed across a wide zone of
  deformation. Moreover, different structural systems will have different
  tolerances to differential movements beneath their foundation.
   
  In their recent paper, Bray and Travasarou (2007) describe displacements of 1
  cm or less as "negligible" and displacements of 5 cm or less as "minor." In
  an oral presentation made to the Los Angeles section of ASCE (on November 15,
  2007), Jonathan Bray described seismic displacements of 15 cm to 1 m as
  "moderate" and those larger than 1 m as "large," but he cautioned that such
  general classifications depend on things such as the foundation system,
  consequences of displacement, the soil behavior, etc.
9-19-161-4: APPENDIX D, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR LIQUEFACTION INVESTIGATIONS AND
EVALUATIONS:
1.0   INTRODUCTION
The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide consultants with a
general outline for performing liquefaction investigations and to specify the
expectations of Draper City. These standards constitute the minimum level of
effort required in conducting liquefaction investigations in Draper City.
Considering the complexity inherent in performing liquefaction investigations,
additional effort beyond the minimum standards presented herein may be required
at some sites to adequately address the liquefaction potential at the site. The
information presented herein does not relieve consultants of their duty to
perform additional geologic or geotechnical engineering analyses they believe
are necessary to adequately assess the liquefaction potential at a site.
The purpose of establishing minimum standards for liquefaction investigations
is to:
(a)   Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of liquefaction and related hazards;
(b)   Assist property owners and land developers in conducting reasonable and
adequate studies;
(c)   Provide consulting engineering geologists and geotechnical engineers with
a common basis for preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and
mitigation; and,
(d)   Provide an objective framework for regulatory review of liquefaction
investigation reports.
1.1   References and Sources

1.2   Properties Requiring Liquefaction Analyses
Plate A-2 (Appendix A of the Draper City Geologic Hazards Ordinance, chapter 9-
19), Liquefaction Special Study Area Map, depicts generalized liquefaction
susceptibility for the city, and shall be used to determine whether or not a
site-specific liquefaction assessment is required for a particular project.
The Liquefaction Special Study Area map is based on a regional- scale
investigation of Salt Lake County. These maps may not identify all areas that
have potential for liquefaction; a site located outside of a zone of required
investigation is not necessarily free from liquefaction hazard. The zone does
not always include lateral spread run-out areas. The Liquefaction Special Study
Area map is available from the Draper City Planning Department.
The Draper City Geologic Hazards Ordinance requires a site- specific
liquefaction investigation to be performed prior to approval of a project based
on the land-use/liquefaction potential matrix shown in the following table.

1.3   Roles of Engineering Geology and Geotechnical Engineering
The investigation of liquefaction hazard is an interdisciplinary practice. The
site investigation report must be prepared by a qualified engineering geologist
or geotechnical engineer, who must have competence in the field of seismic
hazard evaluation and mitigation, and be reviewed by a qualified engineering
geologist or geotechnical engineer, also competent in the field of seismic
hazard evaluation and mitigation.
Because of the differing expertise and abilities of qualified engineering
geologists and geotechnical engineers, the scope of the site investigation
report for the project may require that both types of professionals prepare and
review the report, each practicing in the area of their expertise. Involvement
of both a qualified engineering geologist and geotechnical engineer will
generally provide greater assurance that the hazard is properly identified,
assessed, and mitigated.
Liquefaction analyses are the responsibility of the geotechnical engineer,
although the engineering geologist should be involved in the application of
screening criteria (section 3.0, steps 1 and 2) and general geologic site
evaluation (section 4.1) to map the likely extent of liquefiable deposits and
shallow groundwater. Engineering properties of earth material shall be
evaluated by the geotechnical engineer. The performance of the quantitative
liquefaction analysis resulting in a numerical factor of safety and
quantitative assessment of settlement and liquefaction-induced permanent ground
displacement shall be performed by geotechnical engineers. The geotechnical and
civil engineers shall develop all mitigation and design recommendations. Ground
motion parameters for use in quantitative liquefaction analyses may be provided
by either the engineering geologist or geotechnical engineer.
1.4   Minimum Qualifications of the Licensed Professional
Liquefaction analyses must be performed by qualified engineering geologists and
qualified geotechnical engineers (see sections
9-19-050 and
9-19-060 of the Draper City Geologic Hazards Ordinance).
  2.0   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Except for the derivation of input ground motion (see section 5.0),
liquefaction investigations should be performed in general accordance with the
latest version of Recommended Procedures for Implementation of DMG Special
Publication 117, Guidelines for Analyzing and Mitigating Liquefaction in
California (Martin and Lew, 1999). Additional protocol for liquefaction
investigations is provided in Youd and Idriss (1997). See Draper City Geologic
Hazard Ordinance (Chapter 9-19) for supplemental requirements. Acceptable
factors of safety are shown on the table in section 1.2.
3.0   PRELIMINARY SCREENING FOR LIQUEFACTION
The Liquefaction Study Area map is based on broad regional studies and does not
replace site-specific studies. The fact that a site is located within a
Liquefaction Study Area does not mean that there is a significant liquefaction
potential at the site, only that a study shall be performed to determine if
there is.
Soil liquefaction is caused by strong seismic ground shaking where saturated,
cohesionless, granular soil undergoes a significant loss in shear strength that
can result in settlement and permanent ground displacement. Surface effects of
liquefaction include: settlement, bearing capacity failure, ground
oscillations, lateral spread and flow failure. It has been well documented that
soil liquefaction may occur in clean sands, silty sands, and sandy silt, non-
plastic silts and gravelly soils. The following conditions must be present for
liquefaction to occur:
(a)   Soils must be submerged below the water table;
(b)   Soils must be loose to moderately dense;
(c)   Ground shaking must be relatively intense; and
(d)   The duration of ground shaking must be sufficient for the soils to
generate seismically-induced excess pore water pressure and lose their shearing
resistance.
The following screening criteria may be applied to determine if further
quantitative evaluation of liquefaction hazard is required:
(a)   If the estimated maximum past-, current-, and maximum- future-
groundwater-levels (i.e., the highest groundwater level applicable for
liquefaction analyses) are determined to be deeper than 50 feet below the
existing ground surface or proposed finished grade (whichever is deeper),
liquefaction assessments are not required. For soil materials that are located
above the level of the groundwater, a quantitative assessment of seismically
induced settlement is required.
(b)   If "bedrock" or similar lithified formational material underlies the
site, those materials need not be considered liquefiable and no analysis of
their liquefaction potential is necessary.
(c)   If the corrected standard penetration blow count, (N1)60, is greater than
or equal to 33 in all samples with a sufficient number of tests, liquefaction
assessments are not required. If cone penetration test soundings are made, the
corrected cone penetration test tip resistance, qc1N, should be greater than or
equal to 180 in all soundings in sand materials, otherwise liquefaction
assessments are needed.
If plastic soil (PI 20) materials are encountered during site exploration,
those materials may be considered non-liquefiable. Additional acceptable
screening criteria regarding the effects of plasticity on liquefaction
susceptibility are presented in Boulanger and Idriss (2004), Bray and Sancio
(2006), and Seed and others (2003).
If the screening investigation clearly demonstrates the absence of liquefaction
hazards at a project site and the City concurs, the screening investigation
will satisfy the site investigation report requirement for liquefaction
hazards. If not, a quantitative evaluation is required to assess the
liquefaction hazards.
4.0   FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Geotechnical field investigations are routinely performed for new projects as
part of the normal development and design process. Geologic reconnaissance and
subsurface explorations are normally performed as part of the field exploration
program even when liquefaction does not need to be investigated.
4.1   Geologic Reconnaissance
Geologic research and reconnaissance are important to provide information to
define the extent of unconsolidated deposits that may be prone to liquefaction.
Such information should be presented on geologic maps and cross sections and
provide a description of the formations present at the site that includes the
nature, thickness, and origin of Quaternary deposits with liquefaction
potential. There also should be an analysis of groundwater conditions at the
site that includes the highest recorded water level and the highest water level
likely to occur under the most adverse foreseeable conditions in the future.
During the field investigation, the engineering geologist should map the limits
of unconsolidated deposits with liquefaction potential. Liquefaction typically
occurs in cohesionless silt, sand, and fine-grained gravel deposits of Holocene
to late Pleistocene age in areas where the groundwater is shallower than about
50 feet.
Shallow groundwater may exist for a variety of reasons, some of which are of
natural and or manmade origin. Landscape irrigation, on-site sewage disposal,
and unlined manmade lakes reservoirs, and storm-water detention basins may
create a shallow groundwater table in sediments that were previously
unsaturated.
4.2   Subsurface Explorations
Subsurface explorations shall consist of drilled-borings and/or cone
penetration tests (CPTs). The exploration program shall be planned to determine
the soil stratigraphy, groundwater level, and indices that could be used to
evaluate the potential for liquefaction by either in situ testing or by
laboratory testing of soil samples. Borings and CPT soundings must penetrate a
minimum of 50 feet below final ground surface. If a standard penetration test
(SPT) is used, sampling intervals shall not exceed 2.5 feet.
For saturated cohesionless soils where the SPT (N1)60 values are less than 15,
or where CPT tip resistances are below 60 tsf, grain-size analyses, hydrometers
tests, and Atterberg Limits tests shall be performed on these soils to further
evaluate their potential for permanent ground displacement (Youd et al., 2002)
and other forms of liquefaction-induced ground failure and settlement.
Where a structure may have subterranean construction or deep foundations (e.g.,
caissons or piles), the depth of investigation should extend to a depth that is
a minimum of 20 feet (6 m) below the lowest expected foundation level (e.g.,
caisson bottom or pile tip) or 50 feet (15 m) below the existing ground surface
or lowest proposed finished grade, whichever is deeper. If, during the
investigation, the indices to evaluate liquefaction indicate that the
liquefaction potential may extend below that depth, the exploration should be
continued until a significant thickness (at least 10 feet or 3 m, to the extent
possible) of nonliquefiable soils are encountered.
5.0   GROUND MOTION FOR LIQUEFACTION SUSCEPTIBILITY AND GROUND DEFORMATION
ANALYSES
The two controlling faults that would most affect Draper City are the Salt Lake
City and Provo segments of the Wasatch Fault Zone (WFZ). Repeated Holocene
movement has been well documented along both segments (Black and others, 2003).
Studies along the Provo segment of the WFZ indicate a recurrence interval of
about 1150 years (Olig, and others, 2006; later revised, Olig, 2007) and the
most recent event being about 500 to 650 years ago (Black and others, 2003;
Olig, and others, 2006). Studies along the Salt Lake City segment of the WFZ
indicate a recurrence interval of about 1300 years and the most recent event
being about 1300 years ago (Lund, 2005). Based on the paleoseismic record of
the Salt Lake City segment and assuming a time-dependent model, McCalpin (2002)
estimates a conditional probability (using a log-normal renewal model) of 16.5%
in the next 100 years (8.25% in the next 50 years) for a M>7 surface-faulting
earthquake. Therefore, using a time-dependent rather than Poisson or random
model for earthquake recurrence, the likelihood of a large surface-faulting
earthquake on the Salt Lake City segment of the WFZ is relatively high and
therefore the Salt Lake City segment is considered the primary controlling
fault for deterministic analyses.
In regards to design ground accelerations for liquefaction analyses, Draper
City prefers a probabilistic approach to determining the likelihood that
different levels of ground motion will be exceeded at a particular site within
a given time period. In order to more closely represent the seismic
characteristics of the WFZ and better capture this possible high likelihood of
a surface-faulting earthquake on the Salt Lake City segment, design ground
motion parameters for liquefaction analyses shall be based on the peak
accelerations with a 3.5 percent probability in 50 years (1,400-year return
period). Peak bedrock ground motions can be readily obtained via the internet
from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Seismic Hazard Maps,
Data and Documentation web page (USGS, 2002), which is based on Frankel and
others (2002). PGAs obtained from the USGS (2002) web page should be adjusted
for effects of soil/rock (site-class) conditions in accordance with Seed and
others (2001) or other appropriate methods that consider the site-specific soil
conditions and their potential for amplification/deamplification of the high
frequency strong motion.
6.0   REMEDIAL DESIGN
Sites, facilities, buildings, structures and utilities that are founded on or
traverse liquefiable soils may require further remedial design and/or
relocation to avoid liquefaction-induced damage. These should be investigated
and evaluated on a site- specific basis with sufficient geologic and
geotechnical evaluations to support the remedial design and/or mitigative plan.
This design or plan may include: changes/modifications to the soil, foundation
system, structural frame or support of the building, etc. and should be
reviewed and approved by the City.
7.0   SUBMITTALS
Submittals for review shall include: boring logs; geologic cross- sections;
laboratory data; discussions pertaining to how idealized subsurface conditions
and parameters used for analyses were developed; analytical results, including
computer output files (on request); and summaries of the liquefaction analyses
and conclusions regarding liquefaction potential and likely types and amounts
of ground failure.
Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic
cross-sections and must be utilized by the geotechnical engineer for the
liquefaction analyses. If on- site sewage or storm-water disposal exists or is
proposed, the liquefaction analyses shall include the effects of the effluent
plume on liquefaction potential.
The results of any liquefaction analyses must be submitted with pertinent
backup documentation (i.e., calculations, computer output, etc.). Printouts of
input data, output data (on request), and graphical plots must be submitted for
each computer-aided liquefaction analysis. In addition, input data files,
recorded on diskettes, CDs, or other electronic media, may be requested to
facilitate the City's review.

9-20-020: SCOPE:
All outdoor/exterior lighting shall be in compliance with the regulations
established by this chapter and any other chapters of this title. These
regulations shall apply to all outdoor lighting, including, but not limited to,
buildings and structures, recreational areas, parking lots, landscaping,
streets, and signage. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-030: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter:
EXTERIOR LIGHTING: Temporary or permanent lighting that is installed, located,
or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outside. Fixtures that
are installed indoors that are intended to light something outside are
considered exterior lighting for the intent of this chapter.
FIXTURE: The assembly that holds the lamp in a lighting system, including the
elements designed to give light output control, such as a reflector or mirror,
the refractor or lens, the ballast, the housing, and the attachment parts.
FLOODLIGHT: Light that generally produces from one thousand (1,000) to one
thousand eight hundred (1,800) lumens and is designed to flood a well defined
area with light.
FOOT-CANDLE: Illuminance produced on a surface one foot (1') from a uniform
point source of one candela, measured by a light meter.
FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES: Fixtures that are designed or shielded in such a manner
that all light rays emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamps or
indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a horizontal plane running
through the lowest point on the fixture where light is emitted.
GLARE: Intense light that results in discomfort and/or a reduction of visual
performance and visibility.
ILLUMINANCE: Density of luminous flux incident on a surface. A typical unit of
measurement is foot-candle or lux. For the purposes of this chapter, all units
of illuminance shall be measured in foot-candles.
ILLUMINATION RATIO: The relationship between the maximum illumination value
observed to the average of all illumination values observed.
LAMP: The source of electric light: the bulb and its housing as a part of the
luminaire, also referred to as a light source.
LIGHT: The form of radiant energy acting on the retina of the eye to make sight
possible.
LIGHT POLLUTION: Any adverse effect of manmade light, including, but not
limited to, light trespass, uplighting, the uncomfortable distraction to the
eye, or any manmade light that diminishes the ability to view the night sky,
reducing the general quality of life and the reasonable enjoyment of property
for the community; often used to denote urban sky glow.
LIGHT TRESPASS: Light falling where it is not wanted or needed, such as a light
on a property that shines onto the property of others.
LIGHTING: Any or all parts of a luminaire that function to produce light.
LUMEN: Unit of luminous flux equal to the light emitted in a unit solid angle
by a uniform point source of one candle intensity. One foot-candle is equal to
one lumen per square foot. One lux is equal to one lumen per square meter.
LUMINAIRE: The complete lighting unit, including the lamp, the fixture, and
other parts.
WALL PACK: A light or grouping of lights mounted to the exterior of a building
designed or implemented to provide illumination to an area near the building.
(Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-040: DESIGN STANDARDS:
A.   Recreational Lighting:
1.   The following standards apply to the lighting of all nonresidential
outdoor recreational facilities except baseball, softball, soccer, volleyball,
football fields, driving ranges, outdoor arenas and amphitheaters, or other
field recreational facilities:
a.   The height of any light source shall not exceed twenty feet (20') to the
top of the luminaire or pole, whichever is higher, as depicted in
figure 9-20-1 of this section.

b.   All lighting or illumination units or sources shall be hooded or shielded
so as to allow no light trespass onto any adjacent lot or real property. Lights
or illuminating units shall not direct light, either directly or through a
reflecting device, upon any adjacent real property.
2.   All of the recreational lighting excepted from the above standards shall
meet the following standards:
a.   All metal halide lamps shall be filtered by glass, acrylic, or translucent
enclosures.
b.   No lighting of one hundred fifty (150) watts or greater shall be used
after ten thirty o'clock (10:30) P.M.
B.   Sign Lighting: Although signage is strongly encouraged to be back lit
whenever possible, external lighting of the face of signs, when implemented,
shall be placed above the sign, facing downward toward the sign, and shielded
in a manner that the lamp shall not be visible from any adjacent lot or real
property. Lamp visibility shall be considered as if the glass or globe of the
fixture was not present. External lighting for signage should not produce more
than 0.5 foot-candle of light reflection from the sign. Also see section
9-26-080 of this title.
C.   Security, Landscaping, Architectural, And Other Lighting: All outdoor
lights shall be shielded to reduce light trespass to permissible levels.
D.   Other Pole Mounted Lighting For Parking, Etc.: All lights mounted on poles
eight feet (8') or greater in height shall be directed down perpendicular to
the ground. The lamp shall be shielded so that it will not be visible from any
adjacent real property. Lamp visibility shall be considered as if the glass or
globe of the fixture was not present. Pole lighting should only be implemented
for parking areas and other vehicular circulation features.
E.   Street Pole Mounted Lighting: All lights mounted on poles eight feet (8')
or greater in height shall be directed down perpendicular to the ground. The
light source shall be full cutoff fixtures. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
F.   Exterior Lighting: All exterior lighting, including public street
lighting, as applicable, shall meet the following design criteria:
1.   Background spaces like parking lots shall be illuminated as unobtrusively
as possible to meet the functional needs of safe circulation and protection of
people and property. Foreground spaces, such as building entrances and outside
seating areas, shall utilize local lighting that defines the space without
glare.
2.   Light sources shall be full cutoff fixtures to minimize the potential for
glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property.
3.   All outdoor light not necessary for security purposes shall be reduced,
activated by motion sensors devices, or turned off during nonoperation hours.
4.   Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or any other object
mounted on a pole, pedestal, or platform shall use a narrow cone beam or light
that will not produce illumination of 0.2 foot-candle or greater above the
object being lit. All such lights shall be recessed such that the surface of
the globe is flush with the finished grade or object's base in which the light
is mounted.
5.   For upward directed architectural, landscape, and decorative lighting,
direct light emissions shall not exceed 0.1 foot-candle at the building
roofline.
6.   Light fixtures shall be located, whenever possible, on the interior of
parking areas with light directed such that only the parking areas receive
direct light. Wall pack lighting to be located on building facades shall be
implemented only for the illumination of building entrance areas and directed
such that only the area around building entrances is illuminated.
7.   Maximum pole height is twenty feet (20') except as provided in section
9-20-090 of this chapter.
G.   Number Of Primary Lighting Poles: The maximum number of primary light
poles to be implemented on a site shall be limited to a ratio of one pole for
not less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross site area. If
additional lighting is necessary, a bollard or pedestrian scale light pole of
not more than eight feet (8') in height may be used.
H.   Light Pole Spacing: Light poles shall be spaced such that overlap in the
areas of direct lighting is eliminated.
I.   Wall Packs: The implementation of wall pack lighting should be stringently
avoided with the exception of sites which are incorporating existing lights on
existing structures.
J.   Bollards: The use of bollard style lighting should be the primary
illumination source for all pedestrian walkways and areas as well as buildings
entry areas.
K.   Colors:
1.   Light Color: Site lighting is strongly encouraged to be a white light.
2.   Pole Colors: Site lighting poles shall be black in color. The planning
commission may permit colors other than black for lighting poles upon
establishing findings that the color: a) will architecturally match the colors
of the building(s) on the site to a greater extent than black; and b) will less
dramatically detract from the appearance of the building(s) on the site than
will black poles.
3.   Uniformity: All site lighting poles shall be of the same color throughout
any one site or development.
L.   Light Pole Placement: Site lighting is strongly encouraged to be placed on
the site such that the poles do not line the exterior of the site but rather
are placed toward the interior of the site to reduce the number of poles on a
site and to allow the inherent grade area coverage of the light to be
maximized. (Ord. 1132, 2-17-2015)
9-20-050: DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
There are many ways to adequately illuminate a site without reducing the
aesthetics or safety of the site. Examples of alternative methods strongly
encouraged by this chapter are the use of bollards, teardrop lights, lower
poles, and downward facing gooseneck lights. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-060: SECURITY:
Sufficient lighting should be provided to protect persons and property as well
as to allow for proper function of surveillance equipment. Security lighting
plans shall utilize shielded fixtures; no floodlights shall be permitted. All
security lighting shall be implemented with motion detectors that shall not
turn on unless an intruder is within five feet (5') of the property and
automatically turns off the lights after a maximum period of fifteen (15)
minutes. No security lighting shall be permitted with any off site light
trespass. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-070: ILLUMINATION STANDARDS:
A.   Illumination Ratios: For the purpose of this section, the illumination
ratio shall be the direct comparison between the maximum illumination reading
at any one point on a site and the average of all illumination readings
throughout the same site. This arrangement, although not typical of ratio
comparisons established elsewhere, is done in an effort to achieve an even and
appropriate amount of illumination while maintaining night sky visibility,
reducing light pollution, and providing for general safety throughout Draper
City.
B.   Intensities: All uses which require a lighting plan to be submitted for
review according to this chapter shall maintain compliance with the
illumination found in
tables 9-20-1 and
9-20-2 of this section.

Notes:
   1.    All readings measured in foot-candles.
   2.    Unless more tightly restricted by section
9-20-090 of this chapter.
   3.    All lighting to meet the terms of section
9-20-060 of this chapter or must conform to standard site illumination.
   4.    Such uses in residential zones may be required to maintain lower
illumination levels to mitigate light impacts on neighboring properties.
   5.    All other uses that require a lighting plan not otherwise identified
in this table.
C.   After Hours Intensities: Sites which require a site lighting plan and
which are to contain a use or uses which is not open to their patronage twenty
four (24) hours per day shall also be required to submit a site lighting plan
which details the illumination to be on the site during closed periods. After
hours illumination plans shall conform to at least the following standards:

Notes:
1.    All readings measured in foot-candles.
2.    Unless more tightly restricted by section
9-20-090 of this chapter.
3.    All lighting to meet the terms of section
9-20-060 of this chapter or must conform to standard site illumination.
4.    Such uses in residential zones may be required to maintain lower
illumination levels to mitigate light impacts on neighboring properties.
5.    All other uses that require a lighting plan not otherwise identified in
table 9-20-1 of this section.
2.   Lighting Reduction: The after hours lighting plan shall also demonstrate a
reduction in the number of lighting sources that are on during after hours
times. The reduction in the number of lighting sources shall reduce the
lighting sources in use by at least one-third (1/3).
3.   Alterations: The planning commission may approve an increase in the number
of lighting sources remaining lit or the illumination level during after hours
times upon establishing the finding that such an alteration is necessary to
maintain the security of the site. Said alterations shall only be allowed to
the minimum number of light fixtures necessary to remain lit to maintain
adequate security for the site. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-080: BUFFERING:
Any lighting implemented as a part of a plan as required by this chapter along
a property line shared with a residential use or zone shall conform to the
following standards:
A.   The maximum illumination at any point along the property line shall be 0.2
foot-candle.
B.   No lighting source shall be located within twenty feet (20') of the shared
property line. If the site area immediately adjacent to the property line is a
pedestrian area or landscaped buffer area, bollard style lighting may be used
for illumination of these areas.
C.   No lamp shall be visible from the adjacent property when standing on the
shared property line. Lamp visibility shall be considered as if the glass or
globe of the fixture was not present. (Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-090: STAGED LIGHTING:
For the purposes of this section, staged lighting shall refer only to the
heights of the light poles, allowing greater heights toward the interior of
large parking areas in an effort to minimize the amount and impact of site
lighting required. Sites which incorporate one hundred (100) or more parking
spaces in any one parking area may be designed to include staged lighting
systems. Larger commercial developments which include multiple buildings, uses,
and/or parking areas may, as approved by the planning commission, also
implement staged lighting.
A.   Pole Heights: Sites desiring to implement staged lighting shall not have
pole heights exceeding the following, as depicted in
figure 9-20-2 of this section:
1.   The outermost row(s) of lights may not have poles exceeding fifteen feet
(15') in height, typically measured.
2.   The second outermost row of lights may not have poles exceeding twenty
feet (20') in height, typically measured.
3.   The third outermost row of lights may not have poles exceeding twenty five
feet (25') in height, typically measured.
4.   The fourth outermost row of lights, and all subsequent rows may not have
poles exceeding thirty feet (30') in height, typically measured.

B.   Buildings: Where buildings are located or proposed to be located between
the boundary of the property and the outermost row of site lighting, the
outermost row of lights may be considered a subsequent inner row for all poles
where the building is between the light and the property line so long as the
height of that outermost row of lights does not exceed the height of the
building. Subsequent lighting rows may then increase in height as typical for
inner rows.
C.   Photometrics: The photometric requirements for a site shall not be
adjusted for any site incorporating staged lighting.
D.   Bollards: Sites which are proposed to include a staged lighting plan are
strongly encouraged to incorporate bollard style lighting to illuminate
building entrance areas and pedestrian areas away from parking area lighting.
E.   Boundaries: Sites with a staged lighting plan shall have a maximum of 0.0
foot-candle illumination at any point along the boundary line of the site.
(Ord. 795, 1-15-2008)
9-20-100: REQUIRED SUBMITTALS:
All new construction or reconstruction which is subject to staff design review
and/or site plan approval shall submit an outdoor lighting plan and lighting
study for the entire site which indicates how the standards of this chapter are
to be met as determined by the zoning administrator and/or planning commission,
as required. All outdoor lighting plans must include at least:
A.   The general layout of the site including buildings, pedestrian areas,
parking areas, and site features to be implemented or preserved as natural;
B.   Illumination readings for the site, spaced no greater than five feet (5')
apart, depicting what can be expected at the finished grade of the site;
C.   Location of all proposed lighting sources, whether freestanding or
building mounted;
D.   Design details and quantities for each lighting source type proposed to be
implemented on the site;
E.   Design details, including full dimensioning, for all pole and mounting
systems to be implemented on the site;
F.   Illumination readings measured along the boundary line of the site, spaced
no greater than five feet (5') apart regardless of site size, as can be
expected at the finished grade;
G.   Tabular information declaring the maximum, minimum, average, and ratio
illumination readings for at least general site areas, canopy areas, site
boundary, pedestrian areas, and building entrance areas; and
H.   Complete and clear identification of all aspects of a staged lighting
proposal for the site, as applicable.

section
9-21-070,
table 9-21-2 of this chapter, and in this section.
A.   Building Materials: All main buildings shall utilize a variety of building
colors and materials.
1.   Color utilization should be sensitive to existing development within the
vicinity and the natural landscape in which the project is situated.
2.   Materials shall include a combination of brick, stone, ceramic tile,
masonry materials and wood composite siding. Exposed concrete, cinder block and
concrete masonry unit is not permitted, except for minimal foundation exposure.
Stucco, wood siding, or wood composite siding is to be used as an accent
material only.
3.   A minimum of three (3) colors per elevation is required.
4.   All projects within the institutional care zone shall submit a sample
board containing examples of all exterior surfacing materials and colors,
including roofing material and color, in accordance with subsection

B.   Building Design:
1.   All buildings shall have a residential look and incorporate design
elements such as dormers, a pitched roof, porticoes, quoins, shutters, or other
residential elements consistent with the immediate residential neighborhood as
determined by the planning commission during review.
2.   Long, continuous rooflines greater than fifty feet (50') shall not be
permitted.
3.   The front facade of institutional care structures shall exhibit visual
relief through an array of architectural features and varied setbacks and shall
protrude beyond any garage door by at least five feet (5').
4.   Side and rear elevations that are visible from public and private streets
shall match the architectural detailing of the front facade.
5.   Shared entrances shall be centrally located, accentuated with
architectural detailing, and well lit.
6.   Carports and garages shall complement the project architecture in terms of
design, materials, and colors.
7.   Notwithstanding the height limitations shown in section
9-21-070,
table 9-21-2 of this chapter, greater building height may be allowed pursuant
to approval of a conditional use permit.
C.   Building Placement And Orientation:
1.   All buildings in the institutional care zone shall front onto a right of
way that is accessible to emergency vehicles.
a.   The planning commission may grant an exception from this requirement, if
the following findings can be met:
(1)   Buildings front onto an open space such as a courtyard or park that is
determined to provide a substantial number of public amenities and is
accessible to all residents.
(2)   Standard emergency vehicle access is accommodated for all structures.
b.   Any building with frontage on a public street shall orient units toward
the public street unless an alternately appropriate orientation toward an inner
courtyard or green space is determined by the planning commission.
D.   Site Plan:
1.   All institutional care developments and uses shall have a formal site plan
review, pursuant to section
9-5-090 of this title, or subsequent sections. All site plans shall be approved
by the planning commission. Site plan review may be applied for concurrently
with the conditional use permit approval process.
2.   Parking areas, service areas, buffers, entrances, exits, yards, courts,
landscaping, graphics, and lighting shall be designed as integrated portions of
the total development and shall project a residential character.
3.   Building spaces. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and
acoustical privacy for dwelling units. Fences, insulation, walks, barriers,
landscaping, and sound reducing methods shall be used as appropriate for the
aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants, the
screening of objectionable views or uses, and the reduction of noise.
4.   Pedestrian and automobile circulation shall flow in a logical manner and
integrate neighborhood street connectivity.
a.   The number of road connections and access points for an institutional care
development shall be proportional to the number of units according to the
international fire code.
b.   To encourage connectivity, institutional care developments shall emulate
the existing neighborhood street pattern and design and connect to public
street networks and adjacent private street networks at all logical points.
c.   Traffic calming measures such as lateral shifts, raised crosswalks, bulb
outs, or chicanes shall be incorporated where appropriate.
d.   Institutional care developments shall install sidewalks on both sides of
all private streets. Sidewalks shall be a width of no less than five feet (5').
The planning commission may modify the requirement for sidewalks on both sides
of a private street by eliminating the sidewalk or a portion of the sidewalk on
one side of the street upon a finding that: 1) the second sidewalk or portion
of the sidewalk does not facilitate pedestrian connectivity; 2) ample
pedestrian circulation has been provided and is otherwise satisfied; and 3) the
purpose and intent of the development standards set forth in this chapter are
met. The granting of this modification shall be within the planning
commission's discretion and is intended to be utilized in limited circumstances
where design and site layout adequately provide pedestrian circulation within
the project and the second sidewalk or portion thereof is unnecessary and/or
undesirable.
e.   Pedestrian pathways shall be provided between access points, entryways,
public gathering nodes, and parking areas. Pedestrian access points shall be
installed between the project and the external neighborhood.
E.   Lighting:

benefit the community, including trees, scenic points, view corridors, historic
buildings or locations, unique geological formations and other community assets
shall be preserved and incorporated into the overall landscape plan.
4.   The landscaping upon the entire site shall conform to the following
minimum requirements:
a.   Front setback: A minimum of twenty feet (20') measured from the front
property line from the existing or planned right of way. This standard shall
apply to both frontages of a corner parcel.
b.   Side and rear setback:
(1)   A minimum of fifteen feet (15') between parking areas and side or rear
property lines.
(2)   A minimum of five feet (5') between an access driveway and a side or rear
property line unless said driveway is to be used for common access by an
adjacent commercial parcel.
G.   Screening At District Boundaries: Where the planning commission determines
it appropriate, an opaque screen shall be installed and maintained along all
district boundaries, other than streets, where the premises abut areas zoned
for residential uses, unless otherwise provided.
1.   Except where otherwise provided, the screen shall have a minimum height of
six feet (6').
2.   Acceptable construction materials for screens shall only include ceramic
tile, stone, brick, concrete panel, concrete block, vinyl, or such other

of Draper City citizens expressed therein.
1.   Higher quality designs will bring value to the commercial community of
Draper City and attract businesses which positively contribute to the overall
quality of life and well being of Draper City citizens.
2.   Draper City welcomes a variety of businesses, including local and national
retailers, for whom branding has become an important aspect of developing a
successful and competitive business. While Draper City acknowledges this fact,
the design standards and guidelines enumerated in this chapter are intended to
help and encourage development of imaginative and unique design solutions which
meet these branding needs, while at the same time preserving Draper City's
unique history and community identity.
3.   The provisions in this chapter are meant to supplement the objectives of
other chapters in this title which also impose certain design standards or
requirements that are zone specific. Examples of this include the requirements
of the town center and destination commercial zones.
B.   Design Criteria: This chapter establishes design standards intended to
improve the quality and compatibility of development, particularly with regard
to building design, and site design. These criteria apply to all commercial
projects and are the minimum that will be accepted.
1.   Design Standards: Design standards are required in addition to other
standards set forth in this title and are indicated by the verb "shall". Design
standards are intended to ensure quality development and permanence in design.
The implementation of these standards ensures that the goals and values of the
community are reflected in each commercial development and contribute
positively to the overall built environment. (Ord. 799, 12-4-2007; amd. Ord.
1479, 2-16-2021)

zoning classification or overlay zone, such as the town center or destination
commercial zones; or
b.   The requirements of this chapter are expressly superseded by another
provision of this title.
2.   Existing buildings and uses when a change occurs that involves a standard
or guideline set forth in this chapter; and (Ord. 799, 12-4-2007)
a.   Requires a building or other permit issued by the city;
b.   Increases required parking; or
c.   Increases the amount of outside storage. (Ord. 867, 11-18-2008)
B.   Imposition Of Conditions: In approving a development plan, the planning
commission may impose conditions consistent with the purpose and intent of this
title.
C.   Other Code Requirements: The requirements of this chapter shall apply in
addition to other applicable requirements of this title, including, but not
limited to:
1.   Chapter 20, "Outdoor Lighting";
2.   Chapter 23, "Landscaping And Screening";
3.   Chapter 24, "Natural Resources Inventory";
4.   Chapter 25, "Parking"; and
5.   Chapter 26, "Signs". (Ord. 799, 12-4-2007)
9-22-030: DEVIATION FROM DESIGN STANDARDS:
A.   Purpose: An applicant may request deviations from the design standards of
section
9-22-040 and
9-22-050 of this chapter with the exception of the height and roofline design
standards of subsection
9-22-040(D). Deviations from the design standards of
9-22-050(F) shall meet the deviation criteria listed in
9-25-080(E)(2).
B.   Deviation Criteria Threshold: Proposed developments requesting a deviation
under this section shall meet at least three (3) of the following criteria.
1.   The proposed development includes additional amenities or pedestrian and
bike connectivity in excess of what is otherwise required.
2.   The overall landscape and open space area provided within the proposed
development exceeds required amounts by more than ten percent (10%).
3.   The proposed development is a transit oriented development (TOD) and
provides direct connectivity for active transportation methods to a
transportation facility.
4.   The traffic impacts of the proposed development will be mitigated through
creative design, traffic calming measures, companywide carpool or transit pass
programs, or other similar measures.
5.   The proposed development is designed to meet LEED certification standards.
6.   The proposed development involves redeveloped buildings, additions to
existing buildings, minor structures being added to a site, or is a new
building within a previously approved phased development and the deviation is
necessary to create a consistency with other existing buildings.
7.   Vegetative landscaping (excluding lawn, turf, and groundcovers) exceeds
the amounts required in this Title by at least ten percent (10%).
8.   The building is designed by a licensed architect in a specific
architectural style, that utilizes facade materials differently than prescribed
in subsection
9-22-040(F) of this chapter.
9.   The amount of primary materials used for each building facade exceeds the
required amount by more than ten percent (10%).
C.   Request Responsibility: The applicant shall demonstrate to the planning
commission that the development application meets three (3) or more of the
criteria of subsection
9-22-030(B) above and that the deviation is of benefit to the city by:
1.   Providing a written description and analysis of the proposed design
standard deviation(s) and an analysis of the selected criteria from subsection
9-22-030(B) above. The analyses shall be written by a licensed professional,
such as an architect, engineer or landscape architect;
2.   Providing a written justification as to why the city should deviate from
its design standards that indicates any benefit to the city.
D.   Findings Required: The planning commission may approve deviations from the
design standards listed in this chapter only if it finds:
1.   That the requested deviation is consistent with the purpose and intent of
the development standards of the applicable zoning district or land use
category; and
2.   That the proposed development satisfies at least three (3) of the criteria
listed in
9-22-030(B). (Ord. 1132, 2-17-2015; amd. Ord. 1535, 5-3-2022)
9-22-040: BUILDING DESIGN:
A.   Context: All building designs shall consider surrounding or nearby
buildings and developments and implement design solutions which are sensitive
to those nearby buildings and developments. The review of this requirement
shall be based on the following:
1.   The buildings positively contribute to the overall character of Draper
City and the neighborhood in which it is located;
2.   The buildings reflect the character of surrounding development through use
of some similar positive and desirable features;
3.   The buildings demonstrate imaginative design; and
4.   Where proposed building designs closely copy or mirror surrounding
development, the buildings vary colors, materials, or architectural elements.
B.   Entrances: All building entrances shall be clearly articulated to indicate
a transition from the exterior to the interior of the building. Every main
entrance shall have a special emphasis when compared to the other portions of
the building. This shall be accomplished through the use of at least three (3)
of the following near entrances:
1.   A prominent architectural feature that is unique to the overall building
design;
2.   Complementary yet differing building materials or colors;
3.   Increased use of windows or glass;
4.   Pedestrian amenities that may include patios, porches, special paving
treatments, seating areas, or awnings; or
5.   Increased landscaping.
C.   Facade Articulation: Buildings designed with completely flat facades and
monotone color schemes are not permitted. All buildings shall demonstrate
articulation of all facades.
1.   Horizontal or vertical facade variations shall occur at least every thirty
feet (30') or along a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the horizontal length
of buildings with facades one hundred feet (100') or greater. This shall be
accomplished by using methods such as:
a.   Variation in the surface plane that may include pop outs, bays, and
recesses;
b.   Variation in the surface pattern such as arches, banding, and paneling; or
c.   Distinguished treatment of windows, doors, and eaves that may include
molding or framing.
2.   Buildings with facades one hundred feet (100') or greater in total length
shall have at least one significant facade variation from the primary wall
plane whose depth is at least five feet (5') and whose width is at least twenty
feet (20'). There shall be no uninterrupted facades one hundred feet (100') or
greater in length.
D.   Height And Roofline: All buildings shall include varied rooflines in order
to add architectural interest and avoid the appearance or sense of monotonous
roofline expanses by:
1.   Providing roofline and parapet variations where there are long,
continuous, and undisturbed rooflines fifty feet (50') or longer;
2.   Using materials and colors on the back of false fronts, parapets,
cornices, or other parts of the building which extend beyond the roofline that
are similar to the rest of the building so that the building appears cohesive
from all views; and
3.   Screening mechanical equipment and systems that are mounted on the roof.
The height of screen walls for mechanical equipment and systems located on the
roof may extend above the typical building height limits in the zone, but shall
not extend higher than the equipment being screened, or fourteen feet (14'),
whichever is less. Screen walls permitted to extend above the typical height
limits in the zone under this section may not be utilized for building signage.
Any portion of the mechanical equipment or systems not fully screened from view
shall be painted the same color as the roofing or parapet materials.
E.   Massing: Buildings shall have a composition which clearly relates to
surrounding buildings, as well as the overall scale of the built environment in
nearby residential or commercial neighborhoods. Proper massing reduces the
impact of the massive bulk created by large buildings that may not otherwise
relate in scale to surrounding development. Vertical articulation, horizontal
articulation, and multiplaned roof and awning designs should be used to
mitigate the impact that may occur on surrounding development and the overall
landscape.
F.   Materials: Quality long lasting materials shall be required for all
buildings in order to contribute to the aesthetics of the community over the
long term. Permanence in design and construction will add to the overall value
and sustainability of the community.
1.   Minimum Colors: A minimum of three (3) colors per elevation shall be
required.
2.   Color Utilization: Color utilization should be sensitive to existing
development within the vicinity and the natural landscape in which the project
is situated.
3.   Primary Materials: Brick, stone, ceramic tile, wood or concrete fiber
composite siding, concrete masonry units (CMU), metal composite material, and
architectural precast concrete are acceptable primary materials. CMU must be
colored and feature decorative or architectural finishes such as honed, scored,
offset or split face. Gray CMU block is not an acceptable finished building
material and shall not be permitted on any finished building elevation with the
exception of minimal foundation exposure. The following guidelines shall apply
when designing a commercial or industrial building:
a.   Each building face shall have a minimum of two (2) primary materials. At
least seventy five percent (75%) of each building's finished face shall be in
primary materials.
b.   When brick is used as a primary material, it may be utilized up to one
hundred percent (100%) of the facade material, in which case, no secondary
primary material will be required.
c.   Doors, glass and roofing materials shall not be included in the
calculations of primary and secondary materials.
4.   Secondary Materials: Secondary materials may include stucco; EIFS,
including specialty finishes; metal, excluding corrugated sheet metal; exposed
concrete; vinyl; shake shingles or wood siding. Materials such as awnings, wood
timbers and other similar features will be considered accent and not figured
into the totals of secondary materials.
5.   Tilt-Up Concrete: Exposed tilt-up concrete may be used as a primary
material on buildings located in all manufacturing zones and in the CBP zoning
classification. Some variation in materials along the base and near the
entrances of concrete tilt-ups is required.
6.   Sample Board: All projects shall submit color elevations that call out the
specific building material type and color. The Zoning Administrator may require
actual samples of exterior surface materials in order to verify quality of
material and conformance with the standards found within this section.
G.   Pedestrian Considerations: Buildings designed at the human scale
effectively relate to pedestrians and create inviting and hospitable commercial
districts that encourage pedestrian activity and social interaction. All
buildings shall consider pedestrians as an integral part of the design.
Additionally, buildings that contain more than one story or that are above
twenty feet (20') in height shall provide a clearly articulated and more
detailed base that relates to pedestrians.
H.   Signs: Signs located on any building facade shall be compatible with the
building's overall design. As an integral design element, signs shall be
compatible with the style of the buildings in terms of location, scale, color,
and lettering.
1.   The locations for signs on a building's facade shall be planned for as
part of the building's overall design.
2.   Signs located on facades should integrate similar or complementary
materials as the building.
I.   Windows: Windows are key to the overall design of a building and the
relationship between the exterior and interior. The majority of windows shall
relate to the scale of the person.
1.   Windows should be at eye level when possible and provide for transparency
into the building.
2.   Where buildings are adjacent to pedestrian walkways, transparent windows
shall be used to relate the scale of the building and the building's interior
to pedestrians. Where transparent windows may not be desirable, tinted windows,
false windows, or glass block shall be used.
3.   Window awnings are an effective way to add detail and variation to a
building, emphasize pedestrian scale windows, and create an exciting and
inviting environment. When placing awnings:
a.   Quality materials shall be used which are durable and are able to
withstand extremes in the weather;
b.   Colors should be complementary to the color of the building on which the
awning is located; and
c.   Styles should be compatible with the architectural features and overall
architecture of the building on which the awning is located. (Ord. 799, 12-4-
2007; amd. Ord. 1132, 2-17-2015; Ord. 1454, 11-10-2020; Ord. 1535, 5-3-2022)
9-22-050: SITE DESIGN:
A.   Building Placement: Building placement is integral to the site design and
the overall effect any development has on surrounding properties. Building
placement shall be carefully considered as part of the overall development
review.
1.   All buildings shall be located with the main facade and main entrance
facing the principal street to which it has frontage.
2.   Buildings located on corner lots shall orient main facades to each street
and give equal architectural treatment to each.
3.   Buildings shall be located as close to the front property line as possible
considering site, use, and other constraints or requirements of service
providers or of this title.
4.   Building placement on a site shall account for the provision of required
open space, landscaping, facilities, services, and amenities as specified
elsewhere in this title and be situated to take advantage of existing site
characteristics that create privacy, and the beneficial exposure of the
building interior to natural light and air circulation.
B.   Service Areas, Outdoor Storage, and Screening: Screening and separation of
service areas, utility equipment, mechanical equipment, outdoor storage areas,
and other similar areas within a development is required. To accomplish the
necessary screening and separation, the design of these areas shall comply with
the following:
1.   Loading and service bays:
a.   Landscaped areas or walls shall be used to separate loading and service
bays from customer parking.
b.   Loading and service bays shall be oriented away from adjacent residential
areas and major public streets.
c.   The design and layout of loading and service bays shall be designed to
prevent public access to them.
2.   Outdoor Storage:
a.   Outdoor storage areas shall comply with the provisions of section
9-27-230 of this title and be screened from view in accordance with the same.
b.   The area surrounding an outdoor storage enclosure shall be landscaped in
accordance with chapter 9-23 of this title, except in locations necessary for
vehicular access to the storage area.
c.   Outdoor storage areas shall be designed to restrict public access to them.
3.   Trash, refuse and garbage collection:
a.   Outdoor containers for trash, refuse and garbage collection are required
for all development sites.
b.   Containers for recycling collection are recommended, and shall be subject
to the same standards as trash, refuse, and garbage collection.
c.   Containers for trash, refuse and garbage collection shall be screened from
view on all sides by an opaque enclosure, a minimum of six feet (6') in height,
built using the same materials and colors as the building, or masonry or
concrete fencing.
d.   Gates that facilitate access for trash collection trucks shall be required
on one side of the enclosure. Gates may be constructed predominantly or
exclusively of metal components, but must be designed and painted to be
architecturally compatible with the design of the principal building(s) on the
site, and the other sides of the enclosure.
e.   Gates and openings that facilitate access for trash collection trucks
shall not be oriented towards or parallel to major public streets, except where
the enclosure is located behind the principal building, or more than one-
hundred twenty feet (120') from the street.
f.   The gate and enclosure design shall incorporate features capable of fixing
the gate in both the closed and open position. Gates shall remain closed,
except during active collection and disposal of accumulated wastes.
g.   Except for the area in front of a gate, the area immediately surrounding
the enclosure shall be landscaped in accordance with chapter 9-23 of this
title.
h.   The enclosure shall be designed to prevent illegal dumping and restrict
access by pests and nuisance animals.
i.   Enclosures for trash, refuse, and garbage collection shall not be located
closer than ten feet (10') to a property line.
j.   As an exception to the conditional use permit requirement of section
9-27-080 of this title, the zoning administrator may approve or require that a
taller enclosure be built, up to a maximum of ten feet (10') in height, upon
finding that the additional height is needed to mitigate existing or potential
negative impacts to neighboring properties, visitors or employees.
4.   Shopping cart corrals:
a.   Corrals shall be required for all commercial and retail establishments
that provide shopping carts for the convenience of customers.
b.   Corrals shall be anchored to the ground at fixed locations within the
parking area.
c.   Corrals may not be located within required landscape planter islands.
5.   Utility equipment and meters, generators, mechanical systems, and other
similar auxiliary equipment:
a.   The location of all utility boxes, meters, generators, large auxiliary
equipment, ground mounted building mechanical systems and the like shall be
shown on the site plan and on the landscape planting plan.
b.   The location and placement of such equipment within a site shall provide
mitigation of the negative impacts of noise, appearance, or odors that the
equipment may create, particularly for occupants of neighboring properties.
c.   Generators, auxiliary equipment, and other ground mounted building
mechanical systems, shall rest directly on the ground, or a ground level
concrete pad not more than four inches (4") above grade. Where equipment is
mounted to supports or anchors, the bottom of the equipment may not be located
higher than six inches (6") from the ground or concrete pad surface.
d.   Exhaust systems shall not protrude above the equipment.
e.   Utility boxes, utility meters, generators, other large auxiliary
equipment, ground mounted building mechanical systems and the like shall be
screened from public view. A combination of walls, opaque fences, and
landscaping may be utilized.
f.   As an exception to the conditional use permit requirement of section
9-27-080 of this title, where walls or fences are used to screen the equipment
identified in subsection 9-22-050(B)(5), the zoning administrator may approve,
or require, a taller screen or enclosure to be built, up to a maximum of ten
feet (10') in height, upon finding that the additional height is needed to
mitigate existing or potential negative impacts to neighboring properties,
visitors, or employees.
g.   The proposed location, size, and operational needs of public utilities and
utility equipment located on a development site shall be coordinated by the
property owner or applicant together with the applicant's architect, civil
engineer, landscape architect or designer, and the various public utility
providers prior to the submission of a site plan and landscaping plans to the
City.
h.   Once a site plan and landscape plan have been approved by the city,
changes made or proposed to the location, number, or the physical size of above
ground utility boxes, meters, generators, and other auxiliary equipment shall
require submittal of an updated plan detailing the proposed site screening and
landscaping changes. Revised plans must receive city approval in writing prior
to installation of the appurtenance(s) and landscaping.
C.   Amenities: Amenities shall be used to enhance and beautify the site and
provide recreational areas and conveniences for patrons, visitors, residents,
and employees.
1.   With the exception of developments subject to the Multiple-Family Dwelling
Development Standards found in Chapter 32 of this title, outdoor amenities are
required for every development on a site with a combined building total floor
area of twenty-thousand square feet (20,000 ft²) or greater.
2.   Outdoor amenities include:
a.   Seating areas, including patios, decks, porches, benches, tables, and
pergolas;
b.   Water features;
c.   Garden areas designed for active use;
d.   Pedestrian plazas;

f.   Other areas designed and designated for recreational use or convenience of
those utilizing them.
3.   Outdoor amenities shall be integrated into the overall landscape plan
design.
4.   Property owners and managers shall not permit landscaping to overgrow or
impede pedestrian paths or areas.
5.   Each development subject to the requirements of this subsection shall
provide a minimum of two (2) amenities from the list in 9-22-050(C)(2) above
and additional amenities as follows:
a.   Public, Civic, Municipal and Institutional uses:
(1)   One (1) additional outdoor amenity for each additional twenty thousand
(20,000) square feet of floor area.

(40,000) square feet of floor area.
d.   Agricultural business, industry, or processing uses:
(1)   One (1) additional outdoor amenity for each additional forty thousand
(40,000) square feet of floor area.
D.   Landscaping: Landscaping shall comply with the site design requirements of
this section and the landscaping requirements found in chapter 9-23. All
developments subject to this chapter that are required to provide public
landscaping improvements or infrastructure improvements, as defined in Utah
State Code, shall install such improvements, or post an improvement completion
assurance for these items in the manner outlined in
17-4-075 of this code, prior to conducting any other development activity. All
other required landscaping, with the exception of street trees, shall be
installed no later than September 30th of the following calendar year after an
approved use is commenced or a certificate of occupancy is issued, or one year
from the date an approved use is commenced or a certificate of occupancy is
issued, whichever is sooner.
E.   Lighting: Carefully planned lighting schemes shall have the effect of
creating safe environments for pedestrians and motorists. Lighting shall also
be considered an integral design element which adds to the overall site plan
and building design.
1.   Lighting schemes should include coordinating parking, wall, and pedestrian
scaled fixtures which complement building architecture and site features.
2.   Sensitively placed low light landscape lighting that highlights a site's
desirable features is encouraged.
F.   Parking and Site Circulation: Commercial development creates impacts to
the city transportation system, including the mutual inducement of development
pressures and impacts between abutting properties. Applicants for development
shall design proposed parking areas, drive aisles, access points and streets to
have minimal impact on the built environment and provide vehicular and
pedestrian connectivity to abutting sites. City staff shall conduct an
individualized determination for any exaction required by this subsection
according to the procedures outlined in section
9-05-220.
1.   Each application shall comply with the traffic impact study guidelines and
related requirements in section
11-02-060 of this code.
2.   Major internal circulation drive aisles and roadways that provide access
from the public right of way or between buildings on the same site or which
provide required cross access or connectivity to abutting sites shall be
separated from parking areas using curb and gutter and a combination of any of
the following methods:
a.   Landscaping;
b.   Pedestrian walkways; or
c.   Lighting. (Ord. 799, 12-4-2007)
3.   Pedestrian walkways shall have a minimum five feet (5') wide free travel
width. Where wheel stops are not used to keep vehicles off the walkway, the
pedestrian walkway shall be a minimum of seven feet (7') wide. Additionally,
where other encroachments into the walkway exist, widths of the walkways shall
be increased to ensure the minimum five feet (5') wide free travel width.
4.   Abutting nonresidential or mixed use developments accessing a street of a
major collector or arterial class shall have a shared access point between
development sites. When a shared access point is provided between abutting
sites, the city may waive cross access requirements between their parking
areas.
5.   Subject to compliance with applicable engineering standards found in
Titles 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, and 18, nonresidential and mixed use developments
shall provide perpetual cross access and connectivity for pedestrians,
vehicles, and emergency vehicles to abutting properties with existing or
planned nonresidential and mixed use developments by;
a.   Connecting to existing cross access drives, streets, sidewalks and
pedestrian walkways that abut the property; and
b.   Stubbing proposed cross access drives, streets, sidewalks and pedestrian
walkways to abutting properties to facilitate future cross access and
connectivity between properties.
6.   Cross access drives, streets, sidewalks and pedestrian walkways between
properties subject to this section shall:
a.   Accommodate customary pedestrian, vehicular, and emergency vehicle access,
the required minimum width of which shall be five feet (5') for sidewalks and
walkways, and as determined by the fire marshal based upon the requirements for
fire access roadways for cross access drives and streets;
b.   Be constructed of asphalt or cement;
c.   Include access easements for ingress and egress across the cross access
drives, private streets, sidewalks and pedestrian walkways for access by
emergency vehicles and the benefit of employees, patrons and visitors of the
abutting development; and
d.   Be reciprocal between abutting properties.
7.   Easements required under this section shall be recorded prior to issuance
of a land disturbance permit or building permit.
8.   Gates are not allowed across a cross access drive or street providing
cross access or connectivity under this section.
G.   Pedestrian Considerations: Site layout and design shall consider with
equal weight the needs of pedestrians and automobiles. Measures shall be taken
to ensure adequate access and safety for pedestrians on the site.
1.   Pedestrian access from the public right of way through the site to main
entrances shall be provided. These walkways shall be constructed of different
materials than the roadway or parking area, and provide for clearly defined
crossings where there are points of conflict with automobiles.
2.   Similar pedestrian access from public transit stations and stops into the
site and to each building entrance shall be provided.
3.   Differing roadway materials within parking lots shall be used directly in
front of entrances to slow motorists and create a safer environment for
pedestrians.
4.   Pedestrian drop off locations when incorporated within overall circulation
patterns shall be convenient and safe for pedestrians.
5.   Benches, pedestrian scaled lighting, bike racks, and other pedestrian
amenities shall be placed appropriately throughout the site.
H.   Security: Security of the site and CPTED (crime prevention through
environmental design) principles shall be strongly considered in any site
design. Many of the goals of CPTED are supported by and accomplished through
following the standards and guidelines already enumerated in this chapter. In
addition to these standards and guidelines, other measures should be considered
with the following four (4) overlapping CPTED principles in mind:
1.   Territoriality is a design concept that plainly demarcates private space
from semipublic and public areas. Clear territoriality in the design of a site
also creates a sense of ownership wherein people will be more likely to defend
and care for such spaces. Following this principle ultimately creates an
environment where intruders stand out and are more easily identified.
a.   Symbolic barriers, such as landscaping or changes in paving materials or
patterns can be effective in creating defined public spaces.
b.   Spaces which are designed for active use, such as plazas, outdoor seating
and eating areas, benches, fountains, and playgrounds add to the sense of
ownership.
2.   Natural surveillance is a design concept directed primarily at keeping
intruders under observation. Provision of natural surveillance helps create
environments where there is sufficient opportunity for people engaged in their
normal behavior to observe the space around them. Areas can be designed so they
are more easily observed through:
a.   Landscape designs and follow up maintenance that allows for clear,
unobstructed views of accessible areas;
b.   Walkways which are visible, well lit, and overlooked by windows from
nearby buildings;
c.   Mixed uses that engage a site at all hours;
d.   Use of unglazed or tinted windows and doors; and
e.   Lighting of alcoves, stairwells, and other areas which may otherwise
provide concealment.
3.   Access control is a design concept directed primarily at decreasing
criminal accessibility. Provision of natural access control limits access and
increases natural surveillance to restrict criminal intrusion, especially into
areas where they will not be easily observed through:
a.   Clearly marking entrances;
b.   Restricting access to screened areas such as garbage receptacles, delivery
areas, and outdoor storage areas; and
c.   Eliminating design elements which allow access to roofs and upper levels.
4.   Proper maintenance of landscaping, lighting treatments, and other features
can facilitate the principles of CPTED.
I.   Signs: The primary purpose of signs is to clearly identify businesses.
Signs shall be integrated into the overall design of a commercial development,
including materials, and shall add to the quality of the built environment
without contributing to visual clutter. While the approval of signs requires a
separate review and approval process, their placement should be planned for
during initial site planning and provide for required landscaping, lighting,
and other related considerations. (Ord. 799, 12-4-2007; amd. Ord. 1535, 5-3-
2022; Ord. 1583, 6- 20-2023)

C.    Location and Design:
1.    Location: Parking lot land scaping shall be provided:
a.    As a landscaped island at the end of parking rows;
b.   Between rows of head-to-head parking stalls;
c.   As landscaped islands within rows of parking stalls;
d.   At aisle intersections; and
e.   Along major drives and access ways.
2.   Design:
a.   The design of the planting plan layout for the parking area shall:
(1)   Address expected foot traffic patterns;
(2)   Mitigate expected pedestrian safety concerns;
(3)   Provide necessary visibility for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles;
(4)   Include water-wise landscaping techniques, including but not limited to
plant selection and low impact design elements;
(5)   Include at least one (1) tree for each three-hundred square feet (300
ft²) of total overall parking lot landscape area;
(6)   Not include turf; and
(7)   Address the expected snow removal and snow storage needs of the parking
area.
b.   Landscaped islands within the parking lot area shall be at least five feet
(5') wide and one hundred (100) square feet in area, and shall include the
following:
(1)   A minimum of one tree shall be planted in each island;
(2)   Additional landscaping with shrubs, ground cover, or planting beds to
achieve a minimum of 50% coverage by plants at maturity (plants and trees may
be grouped); and
(3)   Drip irrigation adequate to meet tree and plant needs.
c.   No more than fifteen (15) parking stalls may be in a row between
landscaping islands as shown in
figure 9-23-2 below.
d.   Rows of adjacent parking shall be separated by landscaping of at least
nine feet (9') in width as shown in
figure 9-23-3 below. If wheel stops are included to prevent vehicles from
overhanging the landscaping, this minimum width can be reduced down to five
feet (5').
e.   All parking area landscaping and landscaping adjacent to parking areas
shall be bordered and separated from the parking area by minimum six inch (6")
high back concrete curbing. Sections of curbing may be non-contiguous or
eliminated in order to implement low impact development (LID) storm water
features within the development. Where high back curbing is eliminated as part
of a LID design, the installation of wheel stops will be required between the
parking stall and adjacent landscaping to prevent the intrusion of automobiles
into the landscaped areas.

9-24-030: Natural Resources Inventory Requirements
9-24-010: PURPOSE:
A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is:
1.   To set forth the process of preparing a natural resources inventory
("NRI") for development sites; and
2.   To identify and protect natural resources that may otherwise be adversely
affected by construction activities during the development process.
B.   Intent: By identifying existing conditions on a proposed development site
the city intends to achieve a balance between accommodating the development and
protecting the city's existing natural resources. In particular, the city
intends to reach the following environmental management objectives:
1.   Maintain biologically viable and diverse streams and wetlands;
2.   Protect stream water quality;
3.   Improve degraded streams;
4.   Reduce flood potential;
5.   Conserve woodlands;
6.   Protect steep slopes;
7.   Preserve and protect wildlife habitat and corridors;
8.   Protect against development hazards on areas prone to flooding;
9.   Preserve visual amenities and areas for recreation and outdoor education
opportunities;
10.   Protect important cultural resources; and
11.   Enhance important views and vistas. (Ord. 893, 6-2-2009)
9-24-020: SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY:
A.   Scope: Before any development plan may be reviewed for sites meeting any
of the characteristics of this section, a natural resources inventory ("NRI")
report shall be provided for the subject property. For the purposes of this
chapter, a development plan shall be considered an application for a site plan
or preliminary subdivision approval. An application for an amendment to the
same shall not require the submission of an NRI report unless determined by the
zoning administrator that the nature of the amendment is such that will affect
or change the terms of the report. The report shall present the information
regarding the factors set forth in section
9-24-030 of this chapter as they apply to the subject property and to the first
one hundred feet (100') of adjoining property.
B.   Applicability: The provisions and requirements of this chapter shall be
required as follows:
1.   Developments: An NRI report shall be a part of the application
requirements for all subdivision and commercial site plan development
applications on property where any of the following are true for any portion of
the subject property, as further detailed in section
9-24-030,
figure 9-24-1 of this chapter:
a.   Located to the east of Highland Drive north of 13200 South;
b.   Located to the east and south of the UTA light rail corridor south of
13200 South;
c.   Located within a FEMA designated A series flood zone, according to the
currently adopted mapping; or
d.   Located within the sensitive river overlay as shown on the general plan
land use map.
2.   Phasing: Projects proposed to be phased wherein any of the characteristics
of subsection B1 of this section demonstrated as a part of a future phase shall
submit an NRI report for the entirety of the project area as a part of the
application for the initial phase. In such cases, the NRI requirement shall be
considered satisfied for the application for all future phases unless good
cause can be found to necessitate an update or the submission of a new NRI
report. (Ord. 893, 6-2-2009)
9-24-030: NATURAL RESOURCES INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS:
Each NRI report shall provide written documentation to address the factors set
forth in this section with supporting information displayed graphically to the
greatest extent possible. If any of the topical items of this section are not
applicable or otherwise unable to be displayed graphically, notation shall be
provided on maps and drawings in addition to information provided in the
written documentation.
A.   Streams And Floodplains: The report shall show all streams, drainage
courses, and floodplain designations located on or within one hundred feet
(100') of the subject property shown by topographic delineation based on the
most current FEMA flood insurance rate maps or more current sources of
information. If engineering studies provide the basis for topographic or
floodplain information, they shall be reviewed by the city engineer, and may be
approved or rejected, prior to application for a development plan review.
B.   Steep Slopes: The report shall show topography of the entire site
specifically identifying existing slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%).
Slopes between fifteen percent (15%) and thirty percent (30%) shall be
distinguished from slopes greater than thirty percent (30%).
C.   Wetlands: The report shall show all wetlands as defined by the Utah
department of natural resources and the federal clean water act. Wetlands
limitations shall be shown on the associated development plan.
1.   Wetlands shall be shown in the report by a line denoting the boundary of
wetlands or a note stating that no wetlands exist on the site.
2.   Copies of all applications to the U.S. army corps of engineers for
authorization to impact or alter wetlands, when such is proposed, shall be
submitted with the development plan application. Copies of approvals or denials
for the same from the U.S. army corps of engineers shall be a required
submittal prior to the development plan being eligible for a first review by
the planning commission or city council.
D.   Shrubs And Trees: The report shall show shrub and tree stands indicated by
recent aerial photos. Such areas shall be delineated by a circumferential line
extending to the outer perimeter of the tree canopies.
1.   Tree varieties and their range of size shall be indicated through notation
on the aerial drawing sheet identifying the stands.
2.   Trees with four inch (4") or greater caliper, measured according to
standard city procedure, and located within areas proposed to be disturbed
shall be identified.
E.   Dam Or Canal Break Analysis: The NRI report shall show the danger reach of
areas subject to inundation in the event of failure of any dam regulated by the

9-25-010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the provision and maintenance of off
street parking and loading facilities in proportion to the parking and loading
demand of adjacent land uses. The requirements of this chapter are intended to
provide useful and attractive parking and loading facilities, to protect public
safety, and to mitigate adverse land use impacts. (Ord. 986, 3-20-2012)
9-25-020: SCOPE:
This chapter is applicable to all new and existing development requiring
automobile or vehicular access under the provisions of this title. The
requirements of this chapter shall not be construed to prohibit or limit other
applicable provisions of this title, this code, and other laws. (Ord. 986, 3-
20-2012)
9-25-030: PARKING TO BE PROVIDED:
A.   Parking Required: Every land use established under the authority of this
title shall have parking as required by this chapter. Each person who
establishes any such land use shall provide the required parking. The
establishment of a land use shall include any change in use and any increase in
the capacity or intensity of an existing use.
B.   Continuing Obligation To Provide Parking: Provision of parking as required
by this chapter shall be a continuing obligation so long as a use continues
which requires parking. It shall be unlawful for any building owner, land use
operator, or person responsible for providing parking to discontinue or
dispense with required parking facilities without providing an alternate
parking area which meets the requirements of this chapter.
C.   Alteration Where Parking Insufficient: A building, structure, or use which
lacks sufficient parking as required by this chapter may not be altered,
enlarged, or changed unless additional parking for the alteration, enlargement,
or change is supplied that meets the requirements of this chapter.
D.   Parking Continually Available: Except as specifically authorized elsewhere
in this title, each designated parking space shall be used solely for the
parking or storage of one motor vehicle. Dual use of parking spaces for public
safety and emergency access aisles, internal vehicular circulation aisles,
queuing lanes, or similar uses is prohibited. Internal vehicular circulation
aisles providing access to parking spaces may not be encumbered by required
queuing spaces or other waiting/loading areas, with the exception of emergency
access lanes, that could impede access to and from the parking spaces. (Ord.
986, 3-20-2012; amd. Ord. 1471, 1-19-2021)
9-25-040: PARKING CALCULATION:
The following provisions shall be used to calculate the total number of parking
spaces required by this chapter:
A.   Fractional Numbers: Any fractional parking space requirement resulting
from a parking calculation shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
B.   More Than One Use On Lot: If a lot or parcel contains more than one use,
parking spaces shall be provided in an amount equal to the total of the
requirements for each use unless shared parking is approved pursuant to this
chapter.
C.   Square Foot Basis: Parking requirements based on square footage shall be
calculated using gross floor area unless otherwise provided in this chapter.
D.   Employee Basis: Parking requirements based on the number of employees
shall be calculated using the largest number of persons working on any shift,
including owners and managers.
E.   Uses Not Listed: If a development application is received for a use not
specifically included in this chapter, the zoning administrator shall apply the
parking requirements for the use deemed most similar to the use proposed in the
application. (Ord. 986, 3-20-2012)
9-25-050: PARKING LOCATION:
A.   On Site Parking: Except as allowed in subsection B of this section, all
required parking shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the use to which
it is appurtenant. In the case of a multi-tenant nonresidential development in
which multiple parcels are covered by the tenant uses and their associated
parking, the parking shall be considered on site for all of those tenant uses.
B.   Off Site Parking: Where practical difficulties exist in providing on site
parking or if public safety, convenience, or both, would be better served by
locating parking on a separate lot or parcel, the planning commission may
authorize such off site parking subject to the following conditions:
1.   Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not
be located in an off site parking area;
2.   Off site parking areas shall be located in the same or a more intensive
zone which applies to the property where the use served is located;
3.   No off site parking space shall be located more than six hundred feet
(600') from a public entrance of the use served, measured along the route of
the shortest practical walking distance;
4.   Off site parking shall not be separated from the principal use by a street
right of way of a collector or arterial class;
5.   Availability of each off site parking area shall be assured by an
agreement reviewed and accepted by the city which requires at least the
following:
a.   The parking area shall be continuously available unless an alternative
parking area is provided;
b.   All parking spaces shall be available without charge; and
c.   All parking spaces shall be available perpetually to all uses utilizing
the parking; and
6.   Before approving any off site parking area, the planning commission must
find that such parking is conveniently usable without causing unreasonable:
a.   Hazard to pedestrians;
b.   Hazard to vehicular traffic;
c.   Traffic congestion;
d.   Interference with safe and convenient access to other parking areas in the
vicinity;
e.   Detriment to the appropriate use of any business in the vicinity; and
f.   Detriment to any residential neighborhood.
C.   Shared Use Parking: A shared use parking study must be submitted for
review for approval of shared use parking. The study must be reviewed by the
zoning administrator to determine whether the uses will make use of the shared
spaces at different times of the day, week, month, or year. The planning
commission, following a recommendation from the zoning administrator, may
authorize shared use of a parking area subject to the following conditions:
1.   The uses sharing the parking area are unlikely to produce competing
demands that exceed the available parking during the same hours;
2.   Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not
be reduced; and
3.   Ongoing shared use of the parking area is assured by an agreement reviewed
and accepted by the city which provides at least the following:
a.   The parking area shall be continuously available unless an alternative
parking area is provided;
b.   All spaces shall be available without charge;
c.   All parking spaces shall be available perpetually to all uses utilizing
the parking; and
d.   Additional parking shall be provided up to the amount otherwise required
under this chapter if the zoning administrator determines, based on parking
counts, that a shared parking area does not satisfy the off street parking
demand of the uses involved.
D.   Temporary Parking:
1.   Temporary parking, when approved as part of a temporary use or special
event, shall be exempt from the landscaping requirements of this chapter, but
must comply with access and surfacing requirements. Temporary parking may only
be utilized for parking during the same time period that the temporary use
permit or special event permit is issued for.
2.   The city may allow a temporary use or special event to occupy or use
parking areas ordinarily required for a permanent use if it is found that the
temporary use will not cause a shortage in parking needed for the permanent
use.
3.   Parking rows and drive access aisles associated with temporary parking
shall be clearly marked and comply with the minimum size requirements of
sections
9-25-070 and
9-25-100,
table 9-25-2.
E.   Vacant Lots And Open Land: Vacant lots and open land areas shall not be
used as parking areas, except as allowed for a temporary use or special event.
F.   Parking For Residential Uses: All parking associated with residential uses

1.   Cross access between existing, proposed, or anticipated nonresidential and
mixed use developments shall comply with the following standards:
a.   Parking areas associated with all nonresidential and mixed use
developments shall be designed to accommodate cross access to existing and
anticipated abutting nonresidential and mixed use developments;
b.   Nonresidential and mixed use developments on individual parcels which have
access onto a street of a major collector or arterial class shall provide cross
access for parking areas to abutting sites;
c.   Cross access required under this section shall also comply with the
standards listed in subsections
9-22-050(F)(6) through
9-22-050(F)(8).
2.   Deviation from the requirement to provide cross access: The planning
commission shall approve a deviation from the requirement to provide cross
access upon finding that the required cross access:
a.   Would result in the slope of the cross access drive exceeding twelve
percent (12%);
b.   Would result in a violation or nonconformity with other requirements of
this title;
c.   Creates a hazard to health, safety, or welfare by linking two uses, such
as industrial and residential, that would be incompatible with each other;
d.   Would require connection to an abutting development which:
(1)   Was not previously designed and required to provide reciprocal cross
access to the subject property; or
(2)   Includes required site improvements that physically impede the ability to
create a cross access drive between both properties.
F.   Internal Circulation:
1.   Vehicular Circulation: Each parking area shall provide for traffic
circulation on the property to access all parts thereof without the necessity
of exiting onto any street.
2.   Pedestrian Circulation: Each parking area shall provide for safe
pedestrian travel to and through parking areas. Parking areas shall also be
designed with safety features in areas where pedestrians cross vehicular drive
aisles.
G.   Backing Space: Backing space shall be provided for all parking areas so
that cars will not back onto any street, except for approved on street parking
spaces. Sidewalks, pedestrian walkways, and queuing spaces shall not be used as
a part of the required backing area. Separate exits shall be provided for
angled and one-way parallel parking so that vehicles will not exit by backing
onto any street. Backing space for parking areas shall comply with the
applicable aisle widths specified in
table 9-25-2.
H.   Landscaping: Parking areas shall be designed to incorporate landscaping
specified in chapter 23 of this title.
I.   Lighting: Lights used to illuminate a parking area shall be arranged to
reflect the light away from adjacent lots or parcels and shall be consistent
with the standards set forth in chapter 20 of this title.
J.   Paving: Every area used as a parking space or area shall be paved or
surfaced as follows:
1.   Permanent parking areas shall be; paved with asphaltic cement or concrete,
maintained so as to eliminate dust or mud, and graded so as to drain and
dispose of all surface water according to city standards. Surface water
drainage from parking lots shall not cross a public sidewalk or walkway.
2.   The surface of temporary parking areas shall be maintained so as to
eliminate dust, mud, and weeds or other vegetation that present a fire hazard
or other danger to the public. Surface runoff of storm water shall be contained
on site in accordance with applicable city standards.
3.   Parking areas for trailers, travel trailers, boats, watercraft, utility
trailers, and motor homes in residential zones shall be constructed of asphalt,
concrete, brick, rock, or permeable pavers and shall be maintained free of
weeds, loose dust, and mud. The parking area shall be graded so as to drain and
dispose of all surface water according to city standards.
K.   Public Safety And Emergency Access Aisles: Every lot or parcel that
includes a parking area with internal vehicular aisles for access to parking
spaces shall provide public safety and emergency access aisles. Public safety
and emergency access aisles shall conform to the international fire code. The
location and details of public safety and emergency access aisles shall require
approval of the Draper City Fire Marshal. (Ord. 986, 3-20-2012; amd. Ord. 1132,

9-25-090: DEVIATIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE FOR PARKING:
A.   Natural Adjustment Range: In recognition that many factors can be unique
to various potential uses of land in the city, parking requirements established
in section
9-25-100,
table 9-25-1 of this chapter, may be modified to increase or decrease the
parking calculation requirements by a maximum ten percent (10%) without
necessity of requesting a formal modification as outlined in this section.
Parking requirements for residential uses listed in section
9-25-100,
table 9-25-1 may not be modified under the provisions of the natural adjustment
range.
B.   Deviations From Strict Compliance: The number of parking spaces required
under section
9-25-060 of this chapter, or the parking calculation requirements shown in
section
9-25-100,
table 9-25-1 of this chapter, may be deviated in accordance with the provisions
in this section. The purpose of such a deviation is to provide flexibility
beyond natural adjustments to this chapter in order to adapt to specific
circumstances, reduce potential environmental impacts, and conserve resources.
In cases where parking in amounts other than required herein may be
appropriate, the planning commission may approve a request for a modification,
by way of a parking study, to increase or reduce parking requirements based on
findings found in subsection C of this section. When a deviation from strict
compliance is approved by the planning commission, parking shall be provided
according to the standard approved under that deviation with a natural
adjustment that only provides for parking closer to the requirement being
deviated. A deviation from strict compliance as outlined in this section is not
necessary for a proposed increase in parking for residential uses.
C.   Parking Study: When a parking study is required for a request to deviate
from the parking requirements calculated according to section
9-25-100,
table 9-25-1 of this chapter, or when an applicant requests a deviation in the
number of parking spaces required under section
9-25-060 of this chapter, a parking study shall be prepared and submitted by
the applicant for review. Parking studies shall be prepared by a professional
engineer licensed to work in the state of Utah and reviewed as a part of a site
plan application.
1.   Requirements: The study shall provide:
a.   Planning and traffic engineering data, including estimates of parking
demand based on the most current recommendations from the Institute Of
Transportation Engineers;
b.   Data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or
highly comparable to the proposed application as indicated and justified by
density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location;
c.   The source of data used to develop the study's recommendations;
d.   A recommendation for parking requirements or calculations applicable to
the site for which the study is being prepared based on site specific factors,
data, circumstances, and conditions compared against study collected data; and
e.   The name and qualifications of the persons preparing the study.
2.   Review And Recommendation: City staff shall review the study and make a
recommendation to the planning commission concerning the validity of the
parking study, the appropriateness of the conclusions reached, and the
appropriate number of parking spaces that should be required.
3.   Number Of Parking Spaces: The planning commission shall determine the
required number of parking spaces after:
a.   Considering the recommendations of the parking study and city staff; and
b.   Making the findings required under subsection C(4) of this section,
according to the type of application.
4.   Findings Required: The planning commission may approve a deviation from
strict compliance for the number of parking spaces required or the calculation
used only after making the findings of this subsection:
a.   For commercial, retail, office, and mixed use developments, the planning
commission must find that:
(1)   Adequate parking will be provided;
(2)   The total number of spaces that would otherwise be required for each
individual establishment in the development is overly burdensome for the site
specific factors of the application;
(3)   Estimated trade offs between businesses which are open when others are
closed will not overburden the parking provided;
(4)   There is an adequate availability of shared parking for all associated
uses;
(5)   Site or use specific conditions or factors do not provide for compliance
with the parking calculation used or parking requirements outlined in section
9-25-100,
table 9-25-1 of this chapter;
(6)   Transportation alternatives, including proximity to transit stations,
provide adequate transportation to offset any reduction in parking; and
(7)   Any potential for future expansion or addition to the development will
have or will provide adequate parking for that expansion or addition;
(8)   ADA compliant parking requirements are not proposed for adjustment; or
b.   For multi-family or planned residential developments, the planning
commission must find that:
(1)   Adequate parking will be provided;
(2)   The size of housing units, considered by the number of bedrooms and
required visitor parking, does not support the calculated parking requirements
of this chapter;
(3)   The size of project does not warrant the calculated parking requirements
of this chapter;
(4)   The specific parking dedicated for use by visitors and recreational
vehicles is appropriate;
(5)   Any potential for future expansion or addition to the development will
have or will provide adequate parking for that expansion or addition;
(6)   Transportation alternatives, including proximity to transit stations,
provide adequate transportation to offset any reduction in parking;
(7)   ADA compliant parking requirements are not proposed for adjustment; and
(8)   Restrictive covenants specific to the development make provisions to
control parking such that parking for the development will not impact
neighboring properties or public rights of way.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the health, safety and
welfare of city residents and businesses by regulating the design,

not favor any type of speech over another in order to achieve the following
objectives:

B.   To permit signs that are well designed and pleasing in appearance, while
allowing latitude for variety, good design relationships, and spacing between
signs and adjacent uses;
C.   To foster a community character that has a minimum of visual clutter;
D.   To enhance the economic strength of the city;
E.   To provide on site identification for private enterprises;
F.   To provide for public convenience by directing persons to various
activities and enterprises;
G.   To encourage signs that are compatible with land uses;
H.   To minimize light pollution, glare, visual obstructions, distraction, and
traffic and safety hazards with the free flow of travel and activity for
vehicles and pedestrians;
I.   To provide business owners the flexibility to have signs that meet the
needs of the individual businesses;
J.   To provide aesthetic protection for entry areas and primary corridors of
Draper City;
K.   To provide protection from visual clutter;
L.   To promote public safety; and
M.   For the protection and promotion of community appearance. (Ord. 963, 2-15-

intended to contain signage shall identify and be reviewed for a sign allowance
as a part of the development review according to the following:
1.   Sign Allowance Approval: All development applications for nonresidential
projects shall also be approved, as a part of the application for site plan
approval, for the development's desired sign allowance. Development sign
allowance approval need only identify the location and size of all on site
permanent signs. Signage allowance approval shall not constitute approval of a
sign permit. All signage shall require application for and approval of a sign
permit prior to installation.
2.   Master Sign Program Approval: Nonresidential multi-tenant developments
shall pursue development signage approval by way of a master sign program as a
part of the application for site plan approval. Master sign program approval
need only identify the location and size of all desired on site permanent signs
for each unit, pad, or business within the development. The master sign program
shall also include details regarding a signage theme. Approval of a master sign
program shall not constitute approval of a sign permit. All signage shall
require application for and approval of a sign permit prior to installation.
3.   Amendments: Amendments to approved sign allowances or master sign programs
shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator if the amendments fully comply
with this chapter. Amendments which do not fully conform to this chapter may be
reviewed for possible approval by the Planning Commission by way of a site plan
amendment.
B.   Signs Not Associated With New Development: Signs associated with an
existing building or developments, or for new developments that do not have an
approved sign allowance, need only pursue a sign permit and will be reviewed by
the Zoning Administrator or their designee based on independent sign allowances
for each sign.
C.   Sign Permit Review:
1.   Sign Permit Required: Unless otherwise provided by this chapter, every
sign within the City shall require a sign permit prior to its erection,
installation, or use. Such permit is separate and distinct from any building
permit or other permit that may be required by applicable provisions of this
Code.
2.   Conditions Of Permit Issuance:
a.   If a specific occupancy or use displays an illegal or nonconforming sign,
a new sign permit may not be issued for that occupancy or use without
modifications to or removal of the nonconforming sign resulting in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
b.   If there is a requesting tenant having an illegal or nonconforming sign
displayed within a multi-tenant development or shopping center, new permits may
not be issued for that space without modifications or removal of nonconforming
signs resulting in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
c.   A permit for a freestanding sign may be issued for a multi- tenant
building, development, or shopping center, provided the terms thereof specify
modification or removal of all nonconforming freestanding signs resulting in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
D.   Applications For Sign Permit:
1.   Sign Permit Application: To obtain a permit, the applicant must submit a
complete sign permit application to the Community Development Department on a
form prescribed by the City. A sign permit application may include all signs
associated with a property that has received site plan or plat approval, or has
a master sign program associated with approved development guidelines. The
application must be accompanied by the information specified in this section.
Additional information may be required on a case specific basis when determined
to be necessary to verify the engineering or construction of the sign or to

9-26-090: AREAS OF SPECIAL DESIGNATION:
In an effort to complement and enhance the experience and aesthetics of certain
areas of the community, these areas have been identified to have unique signage
allowances. The signage allowances outlined for these special districts shall
not be construed as cumulative to the allowable signage identified elsewhere in
this chapter, but rather the exclusive signage allowable within the areas
identified herein.
A.   Town Center District Special: The intent of this subsection is to enhance
and protect the character of the historic and largely pedestrian areas of the
Town Center area where it exists and is intended to be uniquely distinct from
the other more intense commercial and gateway areas of the City. As such, the
following special sign standards shall apply within the TC Zone only:
1.   Wall Signs:
a.   For any one side of a building the maximum sign area for each one linear
foot of building wall shall be one square foot.
b.   No part of a building wall sign shall extend above a roofline or the eave
line for buildings with a pitched roof. Gable areas shall not be considered to
be above the eave line and for the purpose of this section, dormers shall not
be considered gable areas. (Ord. 1258, 5-2-2017)
c.   No part of such sign shall project from a building wall a distance greater
than twelve inches (12").
d.   Wall signs shall be illuminated through reverse channel halo illumination
techniques only.
e.   No cabinet style construction shall be permitted for wall signage.
2.   Shingle Signs:
a.   Shingle signs no larger than two feet (2') high by three feet (3') wide
shall be permitted.
b.   Such signs shall be suspended from a roof overhang, covered walkway,
covered porch, open lattice walkway, or attached to a building wall fascia.
c.   Such signs shall identify the business.
d.   No part of a shingle sign shall extend further than four feet (4')
horizontally from the building fascia.
e.   Such signs shall be on or adjacent to the business the sign identifies.

front shall be one sign.
g.   Suspended signs shall maintain a minimum clearance between the bottom of
the sign and the nearest grade or sidewalk of seven feet six inches (7'6").
3.   Post And Panel Or Engraved Stone Monument Signs:
a.   Developments shall be allowed to install one post-and-panel or engraved
stone monument sign per street frontage, providing the sign complies with the
development standards herein. The maximum area of such signs shall be twenty
four (24) square feet. The maximum vertical dimension of the cabinet or panel
shall be four feet (4'), and the maximum horizontal dimension of the cabinet or
panel shall be ten feet (10'). For a post and panel sign, the posts shall be no

shall be six feet (6').
b.   Signs allowable according to this subsection shall be made of quality,
long-lasting materials that are compatible with and complement those of the
building they represent.
c.   Signs allowable according to this subsection shall have no setback
requirement from the property line. Such signs shall not be located within the
right-of-way and shall not obstruct the view of vehicular traffic approaching,
at, or leaving any intersection or access to a parking area. Since buildings in
the Town Center have no minimum front setback, there shall be no minimum
landscaping requirement for post and panel or engraved stone monument signs in
the TC Zone.
d.   Signs allowable according to this subsection shall only be illuminated
through means of ground illumination or a back- lighting system, or lights
attached to the top of sides of the sign that shine back onto the face of the
sign. Any illumination must be done in a manner which satisfies the
requirements of chapter 20 of this title.
4.   Signage For Redeveloped Buildings: Existing buildings within the TC Zone
which are converted into uses allowed within the zone may qualify for
additional signage if the front wall plane of the building is located more than
twenty five feet (25') from the property line to which it is oriented. This
additional signage shall be limited to one (1) post and panel or engraved stone
monument sign per street frontage which meets all of the following
requirements:
a.   The maximum area of such signs shall be twenty four (24) square feet.
b.   The maximum height of such signs shall be six feet (6').
c.   The sign shall have no setback requirement from the property line.

parking area.
(8)   A-frame signage may not be located on any sidewalk or pedestrian pathway.
In the case where the right-of-way area between the building and the curb line
is developed entirely as pedestrian area with no landscaping, the A-frame
signage shall be located to allow not less than six feet (6') of clearance
between the building and the A-frame signage for pedestrians.
(9)   There shall be no illumination permitted specifically for A-frame
signage.
c.   Pole Banner Signs:
(1)   Such signage shall have a permanently installed black metal pole which is
twelve feet (12') in height with a two and one-half inch (21/2") to three inch
(3") diameter or square pole with a cap and include extending arms on which
banners can be installed. The metal pole may be placed in a sleeve permanently
installed in a footing but must be secured by a bracket and fasteners.
(2)   A sign permit shall be required for the installation of the permanent
pole portion of pole banner signage, but is not required for the installation
of banners on the pole.
(3)   The height and width of the banner allowed for pole banner signage shall
be five feet (5') high and two feet (2') wide.
(4)   All four (4) corners of a banner installed on pole banner signage shall

limitations for the length of time any banner shall be displayed if such banner
is in conformance with the requirements of this subsection.
(5)   Such signage shall have a setback of two feet six inches (2'6") from the
right-of-way with the ends of the extending arms directed perpendicular towards

shall be spaced by a minimum of fifty feet (50') from the nearest such signage
in the same commercial site or development.
6.   Clearance: All temporary signage which is building-mounted shall maintain
a clearance of at least seven feet six inches (7'6") above any pedestrian
pathway.
7.   District Entry: The City Council may approve City signage which varies
from the terms of this subsection for the purpose of implementing signage which
delineates and announces the entrance into the Town Center District. Such
signage may only be located along primary transportation corridors into the
district.
8.   Other Signs: Signage identified in section
9-26-100 of this chapter shall be allowed.
B.   Freeway Frontage Road: The intent of this subsection is that the areas of
the community directly oriented and related to the I-15 freeway warrant
specialized standards for signage where those properties possess limited and
unique visibility constraints due to higher speeds of traffic and differences
in elevation between businesses and passersby. Any freestanding business or
group of businesses shall be allowed the signs described in this subsection. In
addition to subsections B1a and B1b of this section, to qualify for such signs
the business or group of businesses, if located on more than one lot or parcel,
must have a common driveway and unrestricted cross access between the adjoining
lots or parcels.
1.   To qualify for such signs the business or group of businesses shall:

9-26-110: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
To minimize confusion and avoid unfair competitive disadvantage to businesses
required to satisfy the standards of this chapter, the city intends to apply
regulation of existing nonconforming signs with a view toward their eventual
elimination. This goal shall be achieved by imposing limits on change,
expansion, alteration, abandonment, and restoration of legally existing
nonconforming signs. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of
chapter 6 of this title regarding nonconforming uses and structures shall apply
to nonconforming signs, except where the terms of this chapter conflict, in
which case the terms of this chapter shall govern.
A.   Legal Nonconforming Signs: A sign legally established prior to the
enactment of this chapter which does not fully comply with the terms of this
chapter shall be regarded as a legal nonconforming sign. Such signs may be
continued subject to being properly repaired and maintained, so long as the
existing sign is not expanded in size, relocated, or altered in any way unless
the relocation or alteration brings the sign into compliance with this chapter.
The following alterations are exempt from this provision:
1.   Panel changes for a new business in a legal nonconforming sign; and
2.   Copy changes in nonconforming permanent signs which were originally
approved by the city with a changeable copy feature.
B.   Destroyed Or Damaged Sign: Whenever a legal nonconforming sign is
destroyed or damaged by explosion, fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake,
vandalism, act of God, or any other means beyond the control of the sign owner,
such sign may be restored to its exact size and design immediately prior to its
damage or destruction or brought into full and complete compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
1.   Any destroyed or damaged legal nonconforming sign requiring repairs, must
be repaired back to its exact size and design immediately prior to its damage
or destruction within one hundred eighty (180) days. If a destroyed or damaged
sign is not repaired within one hundred eighty (180) days it will be considered
abandoned and must be repaired to conform to the provisions of this chapter,
removed, or it may be dealt with or removed as specified under subsection
9-26-050H4 of this chapter.
2.   A sign destroyed or damaged as a result of a public improvement project
may be replaced to its exact size and design immediately prior to its damage or
destruction, maintaining its legal nonconforming status, and all permitting
fees shall be waived. Such replacement may also include relocation. Any such
relocation must be to an on site location fully complying with the terms of
this chapter.
C.   Abandonment: Abandonment of a sign shall occur after one hundred eighty
(180) days from the first issuance of a notice of abandonment from the city.
Any nonconforming sign deemed abandoned must be removed or brought into
compliance with this chapter by the property owner. If removal or compliance
does not occur, the city may have the nonconforming sign removed through the
processes specified in subsection
9-26-050H5 of this chapter. An abandoned sign shall not regain any legal
nonconforming status under any circumstance.
D.   Voluntary Conformance Fee Waiver: When any existing legal nonconforming
sign is voluntarily brought into conformance with the provisions of this
chapter, all fees associated with application and permitting procedures for any
resulting conforming replacement sign shall be waived by the city. If multiple
signs are to be replaced, only nonconforming signs shall be eligible for the
fee waiver.
E.   Signs Rendered Nonconforming By Capital Improvements Projects Or Public
Action: Sites experiencing a reduction in setback for the benefit of a capital
improvements project or public action shall be allowed:
1.   To maintain existing signage as legal nonconforming signage; or

shall be allowed the signage opportunities allowed by this chapter.

9-27-090: FLAG LOTS:
The primary purpose of this section is to outline the regulations that a flag
lot must adhere to:
A.   Factors: When property is subdivided, flag lots shall only be allowed
under the following circumstances:
1.   When development of the property on a private lane utilizing existing
zoning and subdivision regulations is not possible;
2.   As a lot split or within subdivisions of fewer than ten (10) lots;
3.   Where creation of a flag lot does not foreclose the possibility of future
development of other large interior parcels that would be developable if a
street were extended to them subject to the street connection requirements
found within section
17-5-030(A); and
4.   The flag lot does not have frontage on a classified street as defined by
and illustrated in the Draper City Master Transportation Plan.
B.   Development Standards: When flag lots are permitted, they shall be subject
to the following conditions:
1.   A flag lot as defined in section
9-3-040 shall be comprised of a narrow staff portion that is contiguous with a
wide flag portion.
2.   The staff portion of the lot shall front on and be contiguous to a local
street, whether public or private.
3.   Two (2) flag lots with contiguous staffs are prohibited.
4.   The minimum width of the staff portion at any point shall be twenty feet
(20') of paved access width. Greater staff width may be required by the fire
marshal based on the access width requirements of the International Fire Code
(IFC).
5.   The maximum length of the staff shall be five hundred feet (500') as
measured from the street right of way line to the beginning of the flag portion
of the lot. The flag portion of the lot shall begin at the property line or
line segments which define the minimum front yard depth per the minimum listed
setbacks for main buildings.
6.   The driveway access within the staff shall be paved with asphalt or
concrete to a minimum width of twenty feet (20'). Design of the driveway shall
provide a manner for controlling drainage water acceptable to the city
engineer. The load bearing capacity of the driveway may be required to be
designed to support the weight of fire and emergency vehicles as required by
the fire marshal and city engineer.
7.   The maximum grade of the staff shall not exceed ten percent (10%) except
in the Hillside Sensitive Lands Overlay Zone where the maximum grade shall not
exceed twelve percent (12%).
8.   For lots where the staff portion is over one hundred fifty feet (150') in
length, sufficient turnaround space for emergency vehicles shall be provided
and an easement for access by emergency vehicles will be required. The fire
marshal shall review and approve the design and location.
9.   No building or structure shall be located within the staff portion of a
flag lot.
10.   The size of the flag portion of the lot shall conform to the minimum lot
size requirement of the zone in which the lot is located, but in no case be
less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet. The staff portion of the lot
shall not be included in this minimum lot size calculation.
11.   The front yard of a flag lot shall be on the side of the flag portion
which connects to the staff and which is most closely parallel to the street
the staff connects to. Setbacks for all main buildings shall be a minimum of
twenty five feet (25') from all property lines for all flag lots less than or
equal to twenty thousand square feet (20,000 ft²) in size, and thirty feet
(30') for all flag lots greater than twenty thousand square feet (20,000 ft²
12.   All accessory buildings and structures shall follow the regulations
contained in section
9-10-040 except that accessory buildings and structures over two hundred square
feet (200 ft²) in size can be built no closer than fifteen feet (15') to a
neighboring property line.
13.   Fencing and landscaping shall comply with the limitations related to view
obstructions listed in section
9-27-080. Fencing along or around the staff portion shall not exceed three feet
(3') in height when abutting the front yard of an adjacent lot or parcel.
14.   Fire hydrants shall be provided to serve the flag lot as required by the
International Fire Code. Any fire hydrants located in the public rights of way
shall be dedicated to the water provider for access to and maintenance of the
hydrant.
15.   The maximum height of main buildings on flag lots is limited to two (2)
stories and a maximum of thirty feet (30').
16.   Total lot coverage of flag lots is limited to no more than thirty five
percent (35%) of the area contained within the flag portion of the lot.
17.   Clear address signage must be installed and maintained at the street.
18.   The developer shall construct frontage improvements in accordance with
the requirements set forth in section
9-27-100 of this chapter and subsection
17-5-060B of this code.

(Ord. 998 , 2-7-2012; amd. Ord. 1132, 2-17-2015; Ord. 1456, 10-6-2020)
9-27-100: FRONTAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
Planned street improvements as shown on the city's master traffic and
transportation plan, including swales, curb, gutter, sidewalk, paved street,
turnabout space, and fire hydrants shall be installed on all public street
frontages as shown on such plan and in conformance with city construction
standards as condition of issuing a building permit for new development or
remodeling of a structure that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the structure's
value, when such improvements do not exist or are not financed for
construction.
A.   Use Changes: Use changes from lesser to greater intensity shall require
the installation of frontage improvements consistent with the intended use as
reasonably determined by the planning commission.
B.   Extent Of Improvements: When the size of a lot or parcel exceeds minimum
zone requirements, the planning commission may determine the extent of the
required improvements if the frontage adjoining a public street is, in its
judgment, excessive based on cost calculations reviewed by the city engineer.
However, frontage improvements shall be provided for no less than the minimum
lot width required by the zone in which the lot or parcel is located.
C.   Dedication And Construction Of Improvements: When widening of a public
street is planned, as shown on the city's master traffic and transportation
plan, street right of way and frontage improvements associated with proposed
development shall be dedicated to the public and improved without cost to the
city to the extent the development creates a demand for such improvements as
determined by the planning commission after receiving a recommendation from the
city engineer.
D.   Appeals: If a street dedication and improvement requirement is alleged to
not be proportional to the demand created by new development, such requirement
may be appealed pursuant to section
2-4-060 of this code. (Ord. 394, 8-7-2001)
9-27-110: FRONTAGE IMPROVEMENTS; METHODS OF PROVIDING:
In lieu of requiring full frontage or right of way improvements, including,
without limitation, curb and gutter, parking strips and associated landscaping,
sidewalk, and paved street improvements, the city may authorize a developer to
satisfy street frontage improvement obligations in one of the following ways:
A.   Install Improvements: Install a fair share of improvements according to
the city engineer's calculations, of the developer's obligation applied to one
or more of the full frontage improvements that extend beyond the developer's
property to complete a tie-in or to a logical terminus.
B.   Form An Assessment Area: Form an assessment area, pursuant to Utah Code
Annotated, to complete the developer's fair share of improvements and
additional improvements to benefit the neighborhood.
C.   Pay Assessment: Place funds in an escrow account equal to the estimated
cost, as determined by the city engineer's calculations, and as approved by the
city council, of the developer's obligation for frontage improvements. Such
funds shall go to the installation of street and frontage improvements in
projects determined by the city according to its discretion of priority.
Placement of the funds into an escrow account shall not be construed to imply
or guarantee to the developer a specific time when improvements will be
installed on the frontage or right of way with funds from a city sponsored
improvement project. However, such escrow shall exempt the developer from
participating in a special improvement district formed by the city for the same
improvements. Any interest which may accrue on escrowed funds shall be
available to the city for use in the improvement project. (Ord. 1132, 2-17-
2015)
9-27-120: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS:
A.   Method Of Measurement: Except as provided elsewhere in this title, height
shall be measured as follows:
1.   Fences, walls, and hedges shall be measured from the average finished
grade of the fence, wall, or hedge line.
2.   Where there is a difference in the grade of the properties on either side
of a fence or wall located on the boundary line of a lot or parcel, the height
of a fence or wall shall be measured from the upper grade of the adjoining
properties wherein the measured height may equal six feet (6') at the upper
grade.
3.   Measurement of height of an accessory building shall be as outlined in
subsection
9-10-040A of this title.

restrict the height of integral architectural features that are not used for
human occupancy, including but not limited to spires, towers, belfries,
cupolas, domes, monuments, chimneys, water tanks, elevator bulkheads, or
properly screened mechanical appurtenances located on the roof of a building.
In the TC zone additional height may be approved by the planning commission per
the standards of subsection
9-11-090(D)(2)(a). No additional height is allowed for buildings in the CN
zone. In all other commercial zones the zoning administrator may approve
additional height for integral architectural features of buildings in
compliance with the following standards:
1.   The overall proposed height of the architectural feature shall not exceed
fourteen feet (14') above the applicable building height limitations of the
zone.
2.   The architectural feature shall not create a detrimental impact to public
health, safety, or general welfare.
3.   The overall area of the architectural feature may not exceed ten-percent
(10%) of the gross floor area of the uppermost story of the building.
4.   The architectural feature shall not create additional habitable area or
usable building floor space.
5.   The overall building design shall include one or more of the following:
a.   Architectural details that emphasize the pedestrian level of the building,
including but not limited to, a cordon or belt course, sign band, awnings or
porticos, a change in building materials, or a change in window shapes;
b.   Architectural detailing of the façade that includes a projecting cornice
at the roofline and cordons or belt courses between floors, or accentuated
building façade zones, as fitting to the architectural style of the building;
or
c.   Other architectural features at the roof level that create a distinctive
form or skyline, including, but not limited to, rooftop gardens, viewing
platforms, shading or daylighting structures, renewable energy systems, and
other similar features.
6.   For a church, place of worship, or public building only the standards
listed in
9-27-120(B)(2) and
9-27-120(B)(4) of this subsection shall apply to integral architectural
features that are not used for human occupancy.
C.   Minimum Height Of Main Buildings: No dwelling shall be erected to a height
less than one story above grade, except that the planning commission may
authorize dwellings designed to be completed with earth mounds when all
applicable building and safety code regulations are met.
D.   In zones where the maximum building height is less than thirty-five feet
(35') a permitted Municipal Use, Franchise Municipal Use, Government Service,
and Operations Center may be erected up to thirty-five feet (35') in height if
the building is set back from each property line an additional one foot (1')
for each additional one foot (1') of building height above the standard height
limit for the zone. Additional height of integral architectural features
subject to the provisions of
9-27-120(B) shall not be included in the additional setback calculation. (Ord.
1132, 2-17-2015; amd. Ord. 1535, 5-3-2022)

sold, leased, or otherwise transferred away so as to create or increase the
nonconformity of a lot, building, or site development.
C.   Substandard Lots: No lot or parcel having less than the minimum width and
area required by the zone where it is located may be divided from a larger
parcel of land, whether by subdivision or metes and bounds, for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of building or development as a lot except as
permitted by this section or by the appeals and variance hearing officer
pursuant to the requirements of this title.
1.   If a portion of a lot or parcel of land which meets minimum lot area
requirements is acquired for public use by condemnation or purchase, and such
acquisition reduces the minimum area required, the remainder of such lot or
parcel shall nevertheless be considered as having the required minimum lot area
if all of the following conditions are met:
a.   Such lot or parcel contains a rectangular space of at least thirty by
forty feet (30 x 40') exclusive of applicable front and side yard requirements,
and exclusive of one-half (1/2) of the applicable rear yard requirements, and
such rectangular space is usable for a principal use or structure.
b.   The remainder of such lot or parcel of land has an area of at least one-
half (1/2) of the required lot area of the zone in which it is located.
c.   The remainder of such lot or parcel of land has access to a public street
with a width of not less than twenty feet (20').
d.   The acquisition or dedication of land for public use is not connected with
an application filed under Title 9 or Title 17 of this code.
D.   Adjacent Lots When Used As One Building Lot: When a common side lot line
separating two (2) or more contiguous lots or parcels is covered or proposed to
be covered by a building, such lots shall constitute a single building site and
the setback requirements of this title shall not apply to such common lot or
parcel line if a document is recorded indicating the owner's intent to use the
combined lot or parcel as a single development site. The setback requirements
of this title shall apply only to the exterior side lot lines of the contiguous
lots or parcels so joined. Final occupancy of a building or dwelling on
adjacent residential lots or parcels to be developed as a single lot or parcel
shall be subject to recording with the Salt Lake County recorder a lot line
adjustment by application to the city, to combine the lots or parcels into a
single lot or parcel.
E.   Double Frontage Lots: Lots having frontage on two (2) or more streets
shall be prohibited, except for corner lots and double frontage lots in
subdivisions which back onto streets shown on the city's master traffic and
transportation plan. Such double frontage lots shall be accessed only from an
internal subdivision street. Frontage on lots having a front lot line on more
than one street, shall be measured on one street only.
F.   Setback; Decks And Patios: Any part of a deck or patio covered with a roof
or enclosed on two (2) or more sides, or which exceeds three feet (3') in
height at any point above finished, shall conform to applicable yard setback
requirements.
G.   Setback Measurement: The depth of a required yard abutting a street shall
be measured from the lot line, except as set forth below:
1.   Minimum Front Yard Requirement For New Construction: In blocks where more
than fifty percent (50%) of the buildable lots or parcels have main buildings
which do not meet the current front yard setbacks of this title, the minimum
front yard requirement for new construction shall be equal to the average
existing front yard size on the block. In no case shall a front yard of more
than thirty feet (30') be required.
2.   Yard Abutting Public Street: Whenever a front, side, or rear yard is
required for a building on a lot or parcel abutting a public street proposed to
be constructed or widened as shown on the city's master traffic and
transportation plan, the depth of such yard shall be measured from a line which
is one-half (1/2) of the proposed right of way width from the centerline of the
street to be constructed or widened, or from the current lot line, whichever is
greater.

consistent with the following classifications:
1.   Natural Open Space (Passive Space): In accordance with chapter 24,
"Natural Resources Inventory", of this title, applicants for multiple-family
projects should survey sensitive and valued natural lands that may be desired
for preservation. If this survey reveals a significant portion of natural open
space that is suitable for preservation, this open space option is preferred.
2.   Improved Clusters: Improved clusters of open space with landscaping/
amenities. This type of open space is large enough in area to be functional for
a variety of uses by residents. The accumulation of green spaces can function
like recreation areas by encompassing required project amenities. This type of
green space is preferred to a myriad of remnant green patches throughout the
project. This option is more appropriate for apartment style developments.
3.   Visual Relief: Visual relief from the street through open space. This
theme includes setbacks (sometimes called front yards), open side yards, and
park strips along the street. This type of open space is meant to give some
spatial relief between the buildings and the street through landscaped front
yards and park strips that are standard for most residential neighborhoods.
This open space theme is more appropriate for townhouse type developments where
units have frontage onto the street.
4.   Standards: The following standards shall apply to all themes:
a.   Open space areas shall be available to everyone residing in the boundaries
of a development.
b.   Open space may include pathways and outdoor amenities.
c.   Open space excludes private balconies, decks, patio areas, recreation
buildings, indoor amenities, vehicle parking, streets and streetscape
sidewalks.
d.   No more than thirty percent (30%) of a development's slope areas in excess
of thirty percent (30%) can be included in the area calculation for open space;
provided, that appropriate amenities making it accessible and usable are
included in the project.
e.   Open space should be centrally located and based on existing natural
features.
f.   Open space should be clustered to create the most beneficial and efficient
use of space.
F.   Amenities: Recreational amenities shall be provided for multiple-family
projects.
1.   Multiple-family projects of up to fifty (50) dwelling units shall provide
at least one amenity from the following list appropriate for the project size
and location. Multiple-family projects over fifty (50) dwelling units shall
provide one additional amenity from the list for each additional fifty (50)
dwelling units in the project, or portion thereof.
a.   Multiple-family projects shall include at least one amenity per fifty (50)
units from the following list:
(1)   Tot lot/play structure.

10-3-050: PARTIAL PERMIT:
Upon a showing of good cause, the building official or the community
development director, may issue a permit for the construction of part of a

statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of the
construction codes and other applicable laws and ordinances. The holder of such
a partial permit shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire
building, structure or building service will be granted, and shall assume all
risks of so proceeding. (Ord. 168, 3-7-1995)
10-3-060: RETENTION OF PLANS:

thereafter as may be required by the Draper City government records access and
management ordinance. (Ord. 168, 3-7-1995)
10-3-070: VALIDITY OF PERMIT:
The issuance of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for violation of
any of the provisions of the construction codes or of any other pertinent law,
including, but not limited to, the city zoning, subdivision and fire ordinances
and regulations. Permits presuming to give such authority shall not be valid.
The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications, and other data shall
not prevent the building official, fire chief or other city official from
thereafter requiring the correction of errors in such documents. (Ord. 168, 3-
7-1995)
10-3-080: EXPIRATION OF PERMIT:
A.   Every permit issued by the city shall expire and become null and void if
the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of such permit, or if the
building or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any
time after the work is commenced for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days.
B.   After expiration of a permit, a new permit must be obtained prior to
recommencing work. If no changes have been made or will be made in the original
plans and specifications for such work, and the suspension or abandonment has
not exceeded one year, the fee for a new permit shall be one-half (1/2) the
amount required for a new permit for such work. If changes have been made or
will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work, or the
suspension or abandonment has exceeded one year, the fee for a new permit shall
be the full amount required for a new permit for such work. (Ord. 168, 3-7-
1995)
10-3-090: EXTENSION OF PERMIT:
A permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply in writing for an extension
of time within which work may commence under that permit showing that
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from
being taken within the time required by section
10-3-080 of this chapter. Upon sufficient showing, the city may extend the time
for action by the permittee; provided, that such extension shall not exceed a
period of one hundred eighty (180) days and shall only be permitted once. (Ord.
168, 3-7-1995)

the provisions of the construction codes or other pertinent law. (Ord. 168, 3-
7-1995)
10-3-110: FEES AND SECURITY REQUIRED:
A.   Except as otherwise provided, all building permit fees shall be assessed
in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the city.
B.   Applicants for new residential, commercial, and industrial building
permits and for pools or accessory structure building permits shall be required
to furnish security in the form of a cash or corporate surety bond or letter of
credit in the amount set forth in the consolidated fee schedule, adopted by the
city to ensure repair and restoration of public improvements damaged during the
construction process. So long as the security covers all active projects, a
developer may post a revolving security on an annual basis.
C.   In the event the applicant fails to timely and fully complete the
permitted work in accordance with construction code requirements and the
provisions of this title, the city may thereafter use the funds comprising the
bond or letter of credit to cause the work to be completed. Any unexpended
portion of the security retained by the city, less fifteen percent (15%) of the
total cost to complete the work to cover overhead and administrative costs of
the city, shall be refunded to the applicant upon timely and satisfactory
completion of the work required and compliance with all other construction code
requirements and applicable laws. If the funds received from the bond are not
sufficient to pay the total cost of completion and the fifteen percent (15%)
overhead fee, the applicant shall be obligated to pay to the city all
deficiency amounts. The city shall pursue all civil and criminal legal remedies
to ensure payment and/or reimbursement for deficiency amounts. Permit fees and
any other fees or security required herein shall be paid to the city before a
permit may be issued. (Ord. 863, 10-28-2008)
10-3-120: INVESTIGATION FEES:
Whenever work for which a permit is required by the construction codes or the
provisions of this title has been commenced without first obtaining a permit, a
special investigation may be made before a permit may be issued for such work.
An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, may be collected whether
or not a permit is then or subsequently issued equal to the amount of the
permit fee required. (Ord. 168, 3-7-1995)
10-3-130: FEE REFUNDS:
The city may authorize the refunding of a fee paid hereunder which was
erroneously paid or collected when written request for such refund is filed by
the original permittee within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
fee payment. The city will not authorize refunding of more than eighty percent
(80%) of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under the permit. In
addition, the city will not authorize refunding of more than eighty percent
(80%) of the plan review fee paid when application for a permit is withdrawn or
canceled before any examination time has been expended. (Ord. 168, 3-7-1995)
10-3-140: PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:

streetlights, culinary and secondary water, sanitary sewer, storm drain and
flood control facilities, shall be required to install all such improvements
along the street frontage of said lot in accordance with all construction
standards, regulations and applicable ordinances of the city. No building
permit shall be issued until the requirements of section
10-3-020 of this chapter are completed.
B.   Duty To Repair: Any person obtaining a permit to build or alter any
structure upon a lot which is improved by required public improvements shall

occupancy shall be issued until all such improvements are repaired.
C.   Duty To Maintain Site: Any person obtaining a permit hereunder to build or
alter any structure upon a lot or parcel which is adjacent to a public street
shall take all necessary measures to confine construction debris to the lot or
parcel and prevent the tracking of dirt, mud, sand, gravel or other materials
onto public improvements. A violation of this subsection which obstructs,
covers or obscures the public improvements, causes damage or is likely to cause
damage to the public improvements or creates a public safety hazard shall be
sufficient cause to issue a stop work order. (Ord. 1042, 1-22-2013)

authority to regulate work under permits issued by other governmental entities
with respect to hours and days of work, and measures required to be taken by
the permittee of said governmental entity for the protection of traffic and
safety of persons and property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to impose any duty, implied or express, on the city
or its employees, officers, agents or assigns, relative to the protection of
traffic and safety of persons or property, arising out of the issuance of any
permit issued by government entities other than the city, or arising out of any
work performed on any public way owned or within the jurisdiction of the city.
(Ord. 259, 1-6-1998)
11-6-100: RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES IN PUBLIC WAYS:
A.   Authority: The city engineer may direct any person owning or maintaining
facilities or structures in the public way to alter, modify or relocate such
facilities or structures as the city engineer may require. Sewers, pipes,
drains, tunnels, conduits, pipe driveways, vaults, trash receptacles and
overhead and underground gas, electric, utility, telephone, utility systems,
communication facilities, water and water pipes shall specifically be subject
to such directives. The person owning or maintaining the facilities or
structures shall, at their own cost and expense and upon reasonable written
notice by the city, promptly protect, or promptly alter or relocate such
facilities or structures, or part thereof, as directed by the city. In the
event that such person refuses or neglects to conform to the directive of the
city, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate
such part of the facilities or structures without liability to such person.
Such person shall pay to the city all costs incurred by the city in connection
with such work performed by the city, including also design, engineering,
construction, materials, insurance, court costs and attorney fees.
B.   Considerations: Any directive by the city engineer shall be based upon one
or more of the following:
1.   The facility or structure was installed, erected or is being maintained
contrary to law, or determined by the city engineer to be structurally unsound
or defective;
2.   The facility or structure constitutes a nuisance, as defined under state
statute or city ordinance. (This section shall not, however, be deemed to
diminish the vehicle impound authority of the police department.);
3.   The authority under which the facility or structure was installed has
expired or has been revoked;
4.   The facility or structure is not in conformity with public improvements
consistent with the general plan of the city for the area;
5.   The public way is about to be repaired or improved and such facilities or
structures may pose a hindrance to construction; or
6.   The grades or lines of the public way are to be altered or changed.
C.   Police Power: Any directive of the city engineer under this section shall
be under and consistent with the city's police power. Unless an emergency
condition exists, the city engineer shall make a good faith effort to consult
with the person regarding any condition that may result in a removal or
relocation of facilities in the public way to consider possible avoidance or
minimization of removal or relocation requirements and provide the directive as
far enough in advance of the required removal or relocation to allow the person
a reasonable opportunity to plan and minimize cost associated with the required
removal or relocation.
D.   Prior Private Easement: This obligation does not apply to facilities or
structures originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the public way, if that
prior private easement grants a superior vested right.
E.   Failure To Comply: Any person owning or maintaining facilities or
structures in the public way who fails to alter, modify or relocate such
facilities or structures upon notice to do so by the city engineer shall be
guilty of a class B misdemeanor. All costs of alteration, modification or
relocation shall be borne by the person owning or maintaining the facilities or
structures involved.
F.   Emergencies: The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other
emergency, as determined by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move
any parts of the system and appurtenances on, over or under the public way, in
which event the city shall not be liable therefor to a person. The city shall
notify a person in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon
as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any
action taken under this subsection. (Ord. 259, 1-6-1998)

A.   A permit does not authorize, provide permission, or imply authorization to
trespass onto private property or private way outside of the public way.
B.   Temporary Improvements: If any sidewalk or curb ramp is blocked by
excavation work, a temporary sidewalk or curb ramp shall be constructed or
provided. Said temporary improvement shall be safe for travel and convenient
for users, and consistent with city standards for such.
C.   Temporary Surface: Where excavations are made in paved areas, until the
permanent repairs are complete, the disturbed area shall be restored and
maintained with a temporary surface consisting of compacted road base or
temporary asphalt.
D.   Disturbances:
1.   At any time a permittee disturbs the yard, residence or the real or
personal property of a private property owner or the city, such permittee shall
ensure that such property is returned, replaced and/or restored to a condition
that is comparable to the condition that existed prior to the commencement of
the work.
2.   The costs associated with the disturbance and the return, replacement and/
or restoration shall be borne by the permittee. Further, a permittee shall
reimburse a property owner or the city, for any actual damage caused by the
permittee, its subcontractor, or its independent contractor, in connection with
the disturbance of such property. However, nothing in this subsection shall
require the permittee to pay a subscriber or private property owner when that
subscriber or private property owner requests that the permittee remove,
replace or relocate improvements associated with the service provided by the
permittee to the property owner and when the permittee exercises due care in
the performance of that service, or when the subscriber or private property
owner provided false information to the permittee on which the permittee relied
to its detriment.

of a private property owner (such as a motor vehicle, fence, air conditioning,
heating unit, or the like) in order to perform some sort of construction,
maintenance or repair by the permittee; or
d.   Permanently removing a permittee's equipment or other appurtenances due to
the revocation, termination or nonrenewal of the franchise, if applicable.
E.   Drainage Channels: Existing drainage channels, such as gutters or ditches,
shall be kept free of dirt or other debris so that natural flow will not be
interrupted. When it is necessary to block or otherwise interrupt flow of the
drainage channel, a method of rerouting the flow must be submitted for approval
by the city engineer prior to the blockage of the channel. Approved rerouting
method shall be implemented and maintained during usage to facility
unrestricted flow.

extend to any subcontractor or independent contractor that the permittee might
employee to perform the tasks pursuant to the permit.
G.   Permanent Structure In Public Way: The requirements of this section shall
not apply to the removal by a permittee, of a permanent structure placed by a
property owner in a public way, unless such property owner has received prior
written permission from the city granting the property owner the right to
install a permanent structure on a public way, and such written permission has
been recorded in the office of the county recorder. (Ord. 259, 1-6-1998; amd.
Ord. 1538, 4-19-2022)

removed or damaged pavement according to the standards outlined on the permit.
All restoration shall conform to the engineering regulations, design standards
and specifications promulgated by the city and shall be accomplished within the
time limits set forth in the permit, unless additional time is granted in
writing by the city engineer.
B.   Restoration By City: At its option, the permittee doing the actual
excavation work may request that the city restore the surface to its original
condition. The fee for such resurfacing shall be determined by the city
engineer in accordance with its reasonable costs for such work and shall be
charged to the person, firm, or corporation making the excavation. Payment for
said work shall be received by the city prior to the issuance of the
encroachment permit in order to accommodate the scheduling by the city of the
restoration and shall be sufficient to cover all associated costs incurred by
the city. (Ord. 259, 1-6-1998; amd. Ord. 1538, 4-19-2022)

Permittee’s obligation to provide them. The city reserves the right to require
complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies, including
endorsements required by these specifications, at any time.
D.   Unsatisfactory Policies: If any of the required policies are, or at any

12-1-010: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the residents of Draper City, Utah, and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
A.   Protect human life and health;
B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
G.   Ensure potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood
hazard area. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009)
12-1-020: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and
property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate floodwaters;
D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009; amd. Ord. 1428, 4- -2020)
12-1-030: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application:
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows, active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition
and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AH, AO, or VO zone on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual chance of
flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain subject to a one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be
designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed
ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone
A usually is refined into zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION: The water surface elevation of the one-percent- annual-
chance flood event. It is the height in relation to mean sea level expected to
be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the
floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. It is also the elevation shown on
the FIRM and found in the accompanying FIS for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-
V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood
that has a one-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given
year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade or below ground
level on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns, posts and piers,
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and b) adequately anchored
so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of
up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99,
AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated
by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-
30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting
the definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the placing of concrete pads, is completed before the effective date
of this chapter.
EXPANSION TO EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
placing of concrete pads.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the city.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report provided by FEMA that contains
flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood
boundary-floodway map (if applicable), the flood insurance rate map, and
supporting technical data.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source; or
C.   Mudslides including mudflows and debris flows which are proximately caused
by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid, flowing mud or debris on the
surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of
water and deposited along the path of the current.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees or dikes constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance, and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,

and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than a designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places maintained
by the department of the interior or preliminarily determined by the secretary
of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the

interior, or
2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement.
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is
not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not
built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation
design requirements of section 60.3 of the national flood insurance program
regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For the purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on the city's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the placing of concrete pads and which is completed on or after the
effective date of this chapter.
READY FOR HIGHWAY USE: A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
A.   Built on a single chassis;
B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the placing of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of
the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
B.   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. See section 60.6 of the national flood insurance program
regulations.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or
other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10),
(d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the national flood insurance program
regulations or the provisions of this chapter is presumed to be in violation
until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, where specified, of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009; amd. Ord. 1428, 4- -2020)

flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a
scientific and engineering reports entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for Salt
Lake County, Utah and incorporated areas” dated September 25, 2009 and November
19, 2021, and “The Flood Insurance Study for Utah County, Utah and incorporated
areas", dated June 19, 2020, with accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM)
and flood boundary-floodway maps (FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
C.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations.
D.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
E.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all
provisions shall be:
1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
3.   Deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of Draper City or any officer or employee thereof, or the federal emergency
management agency for any flood damages that result in reliance on this chapter
or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009;

is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may
appeal such decision in a court of competent jurisdiction.
D.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to FEMA upon request.
E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements
to be erected on a lot of one half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, providing the relevant factors in
12-1-010C have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one
half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
title.
H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
J.   Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
K.   Any application for which a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
L.   Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
1.   The criteria outlined in
12-1-060I are met; and
2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public
safety. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009; amd. Ord. 1428, 4- -2020)
12-1-070: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following are required for all new
construction and substantial improvements:
A.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
B.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
C.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage;
D.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
F.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from
the systems into flood waters; and
F.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009; amd.
Ord. 1428, 4- -2020)
12-1-080: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in subsection
12-1-040B, "Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard",
12-1-050B8, or
12-1-080F of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
A.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement of
any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in
12-1-050C is satisfied.
B.   Non-Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
C.   Enclosures: For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect and must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one
(1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above
grade.
3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings
or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
D.   Manufactured Homes: Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance
with subsection
12-1-070A of this chapter.
1.   All manufactured homes and those to be substantially improved shall
conform to the following requirements:
a.   Manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or
FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood
damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be
elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top
or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
b.   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones
A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
c.   Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in existing
manufactured home parks or subdivisions that are not subject to the provisions
in subsection D1a of this section shall be elevated so that either:
(1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood
elevation; or
(2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements that are no less than thirty six inches (36") in height
above grade and is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
E.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall either:
1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
3.   Meet the permit requirements and elevation and anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
F.   Standards For Subdivisions:
1.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections
12-1-010 and
12-1-020 of this chapter.
2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement
of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet land disturbance permit
requirements of this chapter and title 18.
3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is
less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsection
12-1-040B, "Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", or
12-1-050B8 of this chapter.
4.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
5.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
G.   Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones): Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in subsection
12-1-040B of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (1' - 3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
1.   Within the AO zone, all new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified
in feet on the community's FIRM or at least two feet (2') if no depth number is
specified.
2.   Within the AO zone, all new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community's FIRM or at least two feet (2') if no depth
number is specified or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the requirements of this
section are satisfied.
4.   Within zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be constructed around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009; amd. Ord. 1428, 4- -2020)
12-1-090: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection
12-1-040B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since a floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
A.   All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development are prohibited unless it can be
demonstrated by a registered professional engineer or architect through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of sections
12-1-060 and
12-1-080 of this chapter.
C.   Under 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the national flood insurance
regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory
floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevation, provided the
city first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
(Ord. 914, 9-22-2009)
12-1-100: PENALTY:
Any person, firm, or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee or
otherwise, violating or causing or permitting the violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine, or by imprisonment in the
county jail, or by both as provided by law. Such person, firm, or corporation
shall be deemed to be guilty of a separate offense for each day during which
any portion of any violation of this chapter is committed, continued, or
permitted by such person, firm, or corporation, and shall be punishable as
herein provided. (Ord. 914, 9-22-2009)

empowered to employ persons, purchase and improve real property, acquire
equipment and perform all other acts necessary or incidental to the
accomplishing of the above described purposes, subject to all applicable
ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations, policies and directives of the

water system pursuant to provisions acceptable to the city. (1994 Code)
16-1-020: OFFICE OF WATER SUPERINTENDENT:
There is hereby created the office of water superintendent. The water
superintendent shall be the public works director unless otherwise provided by
the governing body of the city. (1994 Code)
16-1-030: DUTIES OF SUPERINTENDENT:
The water superintendent shall administer and enforce this chapter under the
direction of the city manager and shall manage the city's water pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and pursuant to the resolutions, rules, regulations,
ordinances and directives adopted by the city council from time to time
prescribing his or her powers and duties. (1994 Code)
16-1-040: SERVICE TO DEVELOPMENTS:
The water system constructed or otherwise acquired by the city to supply
culinary water is the property of the city and shall be under the sole and
exclusive control and jurisdiction of the city. The water superintendent may,
and at the direction of the city council shall, make alterations and repairs to
the culinary water system. The city council may from time to time by resolution
make such rules and regulations as the council deems necessary or desirable for
the operation and control of the culinary water system. The city may enter into
contracts with other governmental entities and/or wholesale water delivery
providers for the purchase of water for the city's culinary water system. The
city may contract with other political subdivisions or entities to manage and
operate the city's water system. The city may acquire water rights and/or water

16-1-050: WATER SERVICE:
The water superintendent may allow connections to the city's water system at
such time as the property owner or such owner's duly authorized agent complies
with all of the following provisions of this section:
A.   Application For Water Service: The record owner of any property being
served by the city's water system shall appear as the applicant and customer
for that water connection, and shall be held responsible to the city for
payment of all water service fees and charges incurred by that connection. Any
owner desiring water service from the city shall complete and submit an
application for water connection in a form provided by the city. The property
owner shall be liable for any water fees or service charges incurred by a
renter or lessee or other occupant of the owner's premises.
B.   Water Connections Nontransferable: Water connections shall not be
transferred to a location different from that shown on the application for
water service nor from where originally used, nor may a larger water connection
be subdivided into several smaller connections.
C.   Service Pipe: The property owner or his agents shall install a service
pipe to the curb or property boundary line of his or her property, which meets
the following requirements:
1.   The service pipe is of material and quality specified in the city's
construction standards.
2.   The service pipe will, when used, be buried at a depth and grade specified
in the city's construction standards.
3.   The service pipe is not roughed out closer than three feet (3') from the
sewer pipe at the foundation of any building and is not laid in the same trench
with any sewer line nor is so constructed as to cross the sewer line, and no
service pipe is laid in the same trench as a gas or any other pipe, but a
separate trench is provided for such service pipe at least three feet (3')
horizontally from all other pipelines.
4.   The service pipe does not run across property owned in fee by a person
other than the property owner who applied for the connection, unless a
satisfactory easement is obtained.
5.   The service pipe, when connected, will supply water to no more than one
building (accessory buildings excluded), except that where permission is
obtained by the property owner from the water superintendent, connection of
more than one building may be made to such a service pipe, if the property
owner applying for the connection is the owner of all buildings connected to
said service pipe. For the purpose of payment of fees under this chapter,
however, each building which shall receive water service through a common
service pipe shall be deemed to receive said water service through a separate
service pipe so that a property owner applying for connection shall pay the
charges set forth in subsection G of this section for each building which is to
receive water service.
D.   Illegal Use Of Water Pressure: The water provided through the connection
will not be used for the purpose of driving any motor, syphon, turbine, or
other wheels, or any hydraulic engines, or elevators, or for driving or
propelling machinery of any kind whatsoever, or for any other purpose which the
city council by resolution or the water superintendent by regulation shall
include herein.
E.   Inspection: The service pipe of the building to be connected shall be
inspected by an inspector of the city public works department and found to
conform to these ordinances and to the Utah plumbing code prior to backfilling.
The service pipe and all other underground water lines or connections shall be
open and visible to the inspector at the time of inspection.
F.   Charges Current: The property owner requesting connection shall have no
unpaid delinquent water charge assessed against him or her by Draper City on
any property located within the city or connected to the city's water system.
G.   Fees Due At Connection: Subject to section
16-1-060 of this chapter, the property owner shall pay at the time he or she
files his or her application for connection all of the following applicable
fees which are not refundable for any reason:
1.   The connection charge specified by the city council by resolution, which
may include a capital development fee in addition to the actual cost of
connection.
2.   The cost of installing a special heavy duty meter box to withstand the
pressure of vehicular traffic (if required by regulation of the water
superintendent). (1994 Code)
16-1-060: APPLICATION FOR SERVICE TO DEVELOPMENTS:
A.   Developer's Application For Service: No individual, firm, corporation,
association, or other entity developing real property within city's boundaries
shall be permitted to connect onto city's water mains or to use water therefrom
until a formal written application for service has been received by the city on
a form provided by the city, and the city has accepted the application in
writing.
1.   Number And Type Of Service Connections: The application shall indicate the
size and number of water connections that applicant will require, whether
residential, multi-family, commercial, or industrial use is intended, and shall
be accompanied with such proof as required by city's legal counsel of
applicant's title to any water and water rights which applicant proposes to
transfer to city. Applicant shall also submit a master plan of applicant's
proposed development for review by city's engineer.
2.   Application Fee: Applicant shall pay an application fee in an amount
determined by the city council by resolution adopted by the city council to
offset the costs of reviewing this application by city's engineers and legal
counsel.
3.   Commitment To Serve: The application for service may be accepted and a
commitment of service letter shall be issued by city to the applicant upon a
finding by the city engineer, upon recommendation of the water superintendent,
that city has available water rights and water source capacity and water
distribution and storage facility capacity to serve the proposed development
with a year round supply of domestic and/or municipal and industrial water. The
city engineer shall forward a copy of all commitment letters to the city
council and inform the council of water capacities, distribution and storage
limits. Denial of service may be appealed to the city council in writing within
ten (10) days of the denial.
a.   The finding of available water rights may be based upon either water
rights and sources owned or controlled by city or upon water rights owned by
the applicant that are to be transferred to city in lieu of payment of the
water rights development fee as provided by this section.
b.   The finding of available water distribution and storage system capacity
shall be based either upon the existing system capacities of city, or, upon the
expansion and extension of the main transmission system and the augmentation of
storage capacity constructed by applicant and transferred to the city in lieu
of applicant's payment of the water system development fee as provided by this
section.
4.   Water Rights Development Fee/Donation Of Water Rights: All applicants
seeking water service from city for their development project shall either pay
a water rights development fee in order to cover the capital costs incurred by
the city in acquisition of water rights and the development of water sources,
or, in the city's sole discretion, the developer shall donate water rights to
the city.
a.   The water rights development fee shall be established by the city council
by resolution and shall be due and payable upon the acceptance of applicant's
application for water service.
b.   Applicant may donate water rights in lieu of payment of the water rights
development fee. Acceptance of the offered water rights shall be at the sole
discretion of the city and shall be conditioned upon applicant's compliance
with the conditions precedent of subsection B of this section. Upon legal
transfer of the donated water rights, all or a portion of the water rights
development fee may be waived.
c.   Where no water rights are donated and the water rights development fee is
paid, the city shall allocate a portion of the water rights development fee
paid per unit to a water source development account. These funds shall be used
by city to proportionately offset its costs in developing new wells and other
sources of water supply as required by city to meet the increasing source
demand requirements created by new developments. The remaining portion of the
water rights development fee shall be used to acquire water rights to serve
applicant's development.
5.   Water System Development Fee: In addition to the donation of water rights
and/or the payment of a water rights development fee, applicant shall also pay
a water system development fee in an amount to be determined by the city
council by resolution on each unit of system capacity demand required by
applicant to provide the requested water service to applicant's development.
The fee is required to offset the capital costs incurred by city in
constructing or extending the main transmission system required to provide
service to applicant's development.
6.   Development Fees Subject To Change: Both the water rights development fee
and the water system development fee are subject to change from time to time by
resolution of the city council.
B.   Conditions Precedent To Service Of Developments: Each applicant requesting
water service to a residential development, or commercial or industrial
development within the city, must comply with all of the following conditions
precedent in order to obtain water service from city, unless compliance is
expressly waived by city in writing:
1.   Water Rights For Development: Applicant shall either pay the water rights
development fee imposed by the city or, at the discretion of the city, donate
water rights in lieu of payment of these fees as provided herein. Any donated
water rights must be approved by the city engineer for year round use for
municipal, domestic or industrial purposes, prior to their donation to the
city. The water rights as approved must be of sufficient quantity and quality
to satisfy the current state division of drinking water standards and its rules
and regulations for applicant's intended use. Applicant shall obtain state
engineer approval for the year round use of this water right before the water
right may be accepted by city.
2.   Transfer Of Title Of Donated Water Rights: Applicant shall transfer to
city without cost, and by an appropriate instrument of conveyance acceptable in
form to city upon review of city's legal counsel, title to applicant's water
rights free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except as may be expressly
approved and accepted by city. Thereafter, city shall appear as the record
owner of the water rights involved. The water shall then be commingled and
become a part of the water rights and water supply for city through which all
of its customers will be served, including applicant's development.
3.   Water System Extensions: Applicant shall either pay the water system
development fee or construct at its expense and donate any required main
transmission system extensions as provided by this section. The improvements to
the city's main transmission system shall be limited to those required to serve
applicant's development, and shall be constructed in accordance with city's
approved specifications. All excavation and construction activities shall be
subject to city's engineer's inspection, approval and acceptance prior to
interconnecting these extended facilities with city's existing facilities, to
ensure that the extended and expanded system will be compatible with the
existing facilities.
a.   The city may, in its sole discretion, deem it necessary to construct
excess capacity into an extended main transmission line or storage capacity to
facilitate service to anticipated future customers in the immediate area. In
that case, applicant shall pay for only the capacity required for applicant's
property. The city shall either pay for the excess capacity constructed into
the extended line under a separate cost participation agreement or require
applicant to initially bear the entire expense under a line extension agreement
with city, which agreement shall govern the manner and timing of partial
reimbursement to applicant as other third parties connect onto and receive
service from the extended line and other facilities. Applicant shall be
reimbursed only for the incremental costs incurred in constructing the main
transmission system capacity in excess of applicant's needs. Applicant will be
required to pay for the minimum capacity required by applicant in these
facilities.
b.   Applicant shall install the extended main transmission system to a point
prescribed by city in accordance with acceptable plans and specifications, to
facilitate the orderly development of the next contiguous tract of land.
4.   Subdivision Improvements: Applicant shall construct at its sole expense
the internal or on site water distribution system required to serve the
individual consumers within applicant's subdivision or development, including
all booster pumps, on site storage, and other appurtenant facilities. The
internal water distribution system shall be constructed in accordance with the
city's specifications. Any booster stations and storage facilities shall be
placed at elevations which will be compatible with booster pumps, storage
facilities and pressure zones already existing or which may now or are proposed
as a part of the main water distribution system. Service shall not be provided
through these improvements from city's main transmission system until the
improvements are inspected and approved by city's engineers and accepted by
city.
5.   Pipeline Easement Locations: Where possible, provision shall be made for
the construction of all line extensions and distribution lines within public
streets and easements. However, where the lines must cross private property,
applicant shall obtain at applicant's sole expense all required and necessary
easements in satisfactory and recordable form. Title to any required storage,
pump station or other facilities along with the perpetual rights of ingress and
egress for operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the same, shall be
transferred to city.
C.   Transfer Of Title: Upon compliance with the conditions precedent of
subsection B of this section, applicant shall convey to city, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, except for those specifically agreed to in writing
by city, and by an instrument acceptable to city, the following items:
1.   Any extension of city's main transmission system constructed by applicant
and donated to city as provided in this section, together with all necessary
pipeline easements and rights of way for the operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement of the same;
2.   The internal subdivision distribution system and all appurtenant
facilities, specifically including, but not limited to, all distribution lines,
pumps, storage facilities, booster pumps, and any required treatment
facilities, together with all appurtenant easements and rights of way for the
operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the same;
3.   Title to all storage and well sites, together with any and all easements
and appurtenances in connection therewith, including any required protection
zone easements to protect water sources, pipeline and utility easements and
rights of way;
4.   Title to any water and water rights donated to city as provided herein;
5.   Where any shares or water rights conveyed to the city by the applicant are
inadequate to meet the requirements herein provided, the applicant shall pay
the water rights development fee in an amount set by the city and such payment
shall be made to the city as a condition of approval for development within the
city;
6.   In the event the applicant is not required to furnish the total amount of
water that has historically been used on the developed parcel of land, the city
shall have the first right of refusal to purchase the remaining shares or water
rights which shall be set forth in writing and in recordable form and may be
recorded by the city in the office of the county recorder; and
7.   All water shares or water which may be held either by the city or by any
political subdivision created by the city to operate and maintain the city's
water system, including, but not limited to, a special service district, and
thereafter the city's or political subdivision's designee shall have the right
to vote any water shares held by the city or the political subdivision created
by the city in accordance with applicable rules and regulations governing the
same. (Ord. 961, 2-1-2011)
16-1-070: EXTENSION OF WATER SYSTEM:
In addition to the immediately preceding section, the following provisions
shall apply to anyone seeking to connect property to the city water system
where said system does not extend to such property:
A.   Agreement: Whenever a subdivider desires or is required to install water
connections and extensions for a subdivision, the subdivider shall enter into a
written extension agreement which shall constitute an application for
permission to make said extensions and connections and an agreement specifying
the terms and conditions under which the water extensions and connections shall
be made and the payments that shall be required.
B.   Dedication: Any extension of city water system granted in accordance with
the provisions of this or the immediately preceding subsection shall, upon
completion, become the property of Draper City.
C.   Outside City: Draper City may furnish water service from its water system
to persons outside the city in accordance with the provisions of this section.
Any person or persons located outside the city limits who desire to be supplied
with water service from the city water system and are willing to pay in advance
the whole expense of extending the water system to the property, may make
application to the city council by petition, which in addition to the water
requirements set forth in this section, shall contain a certified
acknowledgment that the petitioner understands that the city in granting the
petition need only supply such water to the petitioner from time to time as
shall be deemed by the city council to be available beyond the requirements of
water use within the city limits and that such extension shall be the property
of and subject to the control of Draper City. If the city council grants the
petition, or any portion thereof, the petitioner and Draper City shall enter
into an acceptable written water system extension agreement, which agreement
shall be executed prior to the commencement of any work upon said extension.
The agreement shall be subject to revocation and termination by the city upon
reasonable notice at any time the city determines in its sole discretion that
the surplus water no longer exists. The city shall have the right to allow
third parties to connect to any water line or facilities constructed pursuant
to this title in which case the city may enter into an agreement providing
partial reimbursement to the developer. (1994 Code)
16-1-080: ANNEXATIONS:
It is the intent that land annexed to Draper City be accompanied by water
rights sufficient to accommodate the needs of the existing and potential
occupants of said land. A donation of sufficient water rights to the city shall
be a condition of annexation; provided, however, that persons or entities
desiring to annex land into the city may in lieu of donating sufficient,
acceptable water rights to the city, pay a water rights development fee
satisfactory to the city to enable the city to serve the annexed territory with
culinary water. In such cases, the petitioner for annexation shall comply with
the provisions of subsection
16-1-060A4 of this chapter prior to the city's acceptance of the property for
annexation and recording of the annexation plat. In the event property is
annexed without the consent of the owner, the conveyance of water rights as set
forth herein shall not be required; provided, however, at the time of
development of such property, all provisions and requirements of section
16-1-060 of this chapter shall be complied with. (1994 Code)
16-1-090: REPLACEMENT OF AN EXISTING SERVICE PIPE:

connection control program for Utah.
   CONTAMINATION: A degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by
sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, auxiliary water supply, compounds
or other materials.
   CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other
material of questionable quality to come in contact with potable water inside a
distribution system. This would include any temporary connections, such as
swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy
sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding multiport tubes or
other plumbing arrangements.
   CROSS CONNECTION, CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow
assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or
control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water
system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's
water system where there are actual or potential cross connections which cannot
be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection
(isolation).
   CROSS CONNECTION, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system
and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly
properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the
protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
   SERVICE CONNECTION: The service connection shall be defined as the water
meter yoke assembly with the city being responsible up to the discharge piping
from the meter yoke.
   WATER PURVEYOR: The water superintendent of the city is invested with the
authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross
connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter.
C.   Requirements:
1.   Policy:
a.   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by State laws, regulations, codes, and this section. Service of water
to a consumer found to be in violation of this section shall be discontinued by
the water purveyor after due process of written notification of violation and
an appropriate time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:
(1)   A backflow prevention assembly required by this section for control of
backflow and cross connections is not installed, tested, and maintained; or
(2)   If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or
bypassed; or
(3)   If an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises; or
(4)   If the periodic system survey has not been conducted.
Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected to
the requirement of this section and to the satisfaction of the water purveyor.
b.   The customer's system(s) shall be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether
cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation
of this section, exist and to audit the results of the required survey.
c.   Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection's water
usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply or to the City's
water system, an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on
the service line of the identified consumer's water system at or near the
property line, or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all
cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line.
d.   The type of protective assembly required under subsection C1c of this
section, shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the point of
cross connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to local and State
requirements or resulting from the required survey.
e.   All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet
the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purposes
described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly
maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under
subsection C1f of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these
rules so long as the water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily
protect the public water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from
the present location, or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the
water purveyor finds that the operation or maintenance of this assembly
constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved
backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and State requirements.
f.   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where
backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified surveys/
inspections, and operational tests made at least once per year at the
consumer's expense. In those instances where the water purveyor deems the
hazard to be great, he or she may require certified surveys/inspections and
tests at more frequent intervals. It shall be the duty of the water purveyor to
see that these tests are made according to the standards set forth by the State
Department of Health, Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation.
g.   All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10) working
days of initial installation. The owner shall notify the City within twenty
four (24) hours of installation of the backflow prevention assembly.
h.   No backflow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a
safety hazard. Example: installed over an electrical panel, steam pipes,
boilers, pits, or above ceiling level.
2.   Discontinuance Of Service: If violations of this chapter exist or if there
has not been any corrective action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days
of the written notification of deficiencies noted within the survey, then the
water purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected
the condition(s) in conformance with the State and City Statutes relating to
plumbing, safe drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto. (1994 Code)
16-1-430: CONSTRUCTION WATER METERING AND CONTAINMENT:
No person shall utilize water from the City's water system without having an
approved device and having an approved fee paid. Usage through fire hydrants,
device to bypass a meter, or water meter without first making application to
the Water Superintendent is a violation. An approved connection is required to
provide water for all development, construction, building or other construction
or related activities requiring water from the City's water system. When a
connection is through a fire hydrant or metered connection then water usage
shall be metered and paid for by the person using such water or the person
owning the real property on which the water is used. When a device to bypass a
meter is used, prepayment of usage fee is required. Violation of this section
shall be a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both, as
prescribed by applicable Statutes of the State of Utah. (Ord. 1352, 9-18-2018)

16-2-010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of
Draper City, its residents and downstream entities through the improvement of
the city's storm drain system by managing and controlling stormwater runoff,
protecting property, preventing polluted water from entering the city's storm
drain system and other receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable as
required by federal and state law. The objectives of this chapter are:
A.   To preserve, improve, regulate, and control the natural and manmade storm
drain facilities and conveyances that constitute the city's storm drain system;
B.   To minimize entrance of pollutants to the city's storm drain system;
C.   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the city's storm drain
system;
D.   To guide, regulate and control the design, construction, use, and
maintenance of any development or other activity that results in the movement
of earth on land within the city limits;
E.   To minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development that would otherwise degrade water quality;
F.   To reduce the amount of stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution wherever possible, through stormwater management controls;
G.   To establish a viable and fair method of financing the construction,
management, operation and maintenance of the storm drain system;
H.   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspections, surveillance,
monitoring and enforcement necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
I.   To establish a penalty procedure for violations of this chapter;
J.   To provide and maintain fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory rates and
charges for the storm drain system and related services which will generate
sufficient revenues for operating, improving and maintaining the storm drain
system at a level commensurate with stormwater management needs; and
K.   To establish a policy whereby present and future rates and charges for the
stormwater utility should be fixed with consideration of the difference in cost
fairly allocated to the various customers based upon such factors as the
intensity of development of the parcel; the types of development on the parcel;
the cost of maintenance, operation, repair and improvements of the various
parts of the storm drain system; the quantity of the runoff generated; and
other factors which present a reasonable basis for distinction, and which will
allow for management of the storm drain system in a manner that protects the
public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 1043A, 4-2-2013; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-

for services and expenses directly attributable to the utility's activities.
The stormwater utility enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law
and city ordinances, rules, regulations and policies.
B.   Billing: The city shall bill, or cause to be billed, property owners for
stormwater utility services. Billing amounts shall be included as a separate
line item on utility bills. A billing shall also be sent to owners of parcels
within the city who do not pay other city utilities.
C.   Collection: Fees and charges shall be considered delinquent if not paid as
determined by the procedures established by the city and will be a debt to the
city, which shall be subject to recovery in an administrative, civil or
criminal action. The stormwater utility is hereby specifically authorized to
impose late fees, interest charges and costs of collection, including attorney
fees, on delinquent properties or accounts, as set forth in the city's
consolidated fee schedule. (Ord. 1043A, 4-2-2013; amd. Ord. 1575, 1-10-2023)
16-2-120: APPEAL OF CHARGES:
A.   Public Works Director; Fee Adjustment: Any nonresidential customer who
disagrees with the stormwater user fee for their parcel may apply to the public
works director for a user fee adjustment. The adjustment request must state the
grounds for adjustment and must be filed in writing no later than thirty (30)

steepness of terrain, location of watercourses, problems of sewerage, driveway
grades, or other physical conditions.
B.   Frontage: All lots or parcels created by the subdivision shall have
frontage on a street, improved to standards hereinafter required, equal to at
least fifty percent (50%) of the street's minimum required width. This standard
shall not apply to commercial development given adequate cross access is

adjoining such right-of-way and not be included in the area of such lots.
C.   Flag Lot: Any flag lot, if approved by the City, shall comply with all
requirements specified in the zoning ordinance.
D.   Minimum Area, Dimensions: The minimum area and dimensions of all lots
shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance for the district in
which the subdivision is located.
E.   Side Lines: The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, shall be at
right angles to the street which the lot faces, or approximately radial to the

master traffic and transportation plan.
C.   Half Streets: Where a half street is proposed, such street shall include
no less than sufficient right-of-way to construct a local street section,
except excluding the park strip and sidewalk on the side abutting adjacent
properties, and the subdivider shall install the same; provided it can be
reasonably assumed that additional right-of-way can be obtained from the
adjacent properties at a later time for the future installation of park strip
and sidewalk along the adjacent properties' frontage. If it is determined that
additional right-of-way cannot be obtained, the subdivider shall provide full
right-of-way and install all improvements for the required street cross
section.
D.   Curbs, Gutters, Sidewalks: Curbs, gutters, and sidewalks shall be
installed on existing and proposed streets by the subdivider in all
subdivisions. The Planning Commission may, after receiving a recommendation
from City staff, modify or waive the street design requirements.
E.   Local Street Angle: Local streets shall approach an arterial or collector
street at an angle between eighty five degrees (85°) and ninety five degrees
(95°).

shall be bonded along with the bonding of right-of- way improvements. When
approved, permanent cul-de-sacs shall serve no more than thirty (30) single-
family lots or units, or one hundred (100) multi-family units, and must be
terminated with a turnaround of not less than one hundred feet (100') of right-
of-way in diameter, or an alternative turnaround design which meets the design
criteria of the Fire Department, City Engineer, and Public Works Director.
Downhill cul-de-sacs shall not be approved unless adequate drainage is
provided.

provisions of
17-5-030(H)(15) below. The provision of a stub road which will eliminate the
dead end in the future shall not permit additional units. Additional dwelling
units may be served by a dead end street at such time as its dead end nature is
eliminated. On such temporary dead end streets, a temporary turnaround area and
recordable easement shall be provided at the end of the dead end street and
shall remain and be available for public use so long as the dead end exists.
Improvements shall be installed in temporary turnaround areas subject to
engineering standards and the International Fire Code. Access points and dead
end streets shall comply with all applicable codes.

unstable soil conditions within the subdivision or development area that would
render impracticable the discovery of substandard or defective performance
within a one year period; a partial release of the improvement assurance, if
appropriate, is provided; and the Land Use Authority establishes objective
inspection standards for final acceptance of the required improvements.
D.   Subdivider Warranty: The subdivider shall warrant that the materials and
workmanship of improvements comport with adopted City standards and will not
fail in any material aspect during the warranty period.

Engineer, be subject to an additional warranty period of up to one year.

request the City Engineer to make a final inspection of all improvements

property, plus the value of one-half (1/2) the land in the street at the time
of the agreement, together with interest at a fair rate from the time of

geologist and soils engineer attesting to the appropriateness, safety and
stability of the proposed cut or fill slope. Such documentation and report
shall be prepared at the applicant's expense and shall address the need for and
design of necessary measures to provide for the safety and stability of the
proposed cut or fill slope.
C.   Slope Length: All applications for land disturbance activities involving
or proposing cut and/or fill slopes shall include a report prepared and signed
by an erosion control specialist or professional of comparable expertise
addressing the design, safety, and stability of the proposed slope lengths.
Such report shall indicate how the applicant will address the issue of length
of slope using the revised uniform soils loss equation (RUSLE). The report
shall indicate the method and/or materials to be used.
D.   Unstable Material: The city engineer may require any cut or fill to be
constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical
(2:1) when, in the city engineer's opinion, under the particular conditions,
such flatter surface is deemed necessary for stability or safety.
E.   Fill Slope Limits: Toes of fill slopes shall not be made nearer to a
property boundary line than one-half (1/2) of the height of the fill, or twenty
feet (20'), whichever is less. Fill slopes shall not be divided horizontally by
property lines. Fill slopes occurring on a side or rear lot line shall be made
a part of the downhill lot.
F.   Intervening Terraces: When intervening terraces are used, terraces shall
be paved using materials as approved by the city and shall have a minimum width
of six feet (6'). Terraces shall be extensively landscaped in accordance with
an approved landscaping plan. Terraces shall be spaced at vertical intervals of
twenty five feet (25'); provided, however, for slopes less than forty feet
(40') in vertical height, terraces shall be approximately at mid height. For
slopes flatter than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), or where soil
conditions require, additional intervening terraces may be required.
G.   Compaction: All fills shall be placed, compacted, inspected, and tested in
accordance with the provisions of this title and the land disturbance design
and construction standards. If the strict enforcement of the compaction
provisions of this section is determined by the city engineer to be unnecessary
because of the proposed or probable use of the land, the city engineer may
waive the requirements. The requirements of this section shall not be waived
when structures are to be supported by the fill, the fills are being placed in
areas to be designated as hillside, or where the fills are necessary as a
safety measure to aid in preventing the saturation, settling, slipping, or
erosion of the fill.
H.   Fills Toeing Out On Natural Slopes: Except as otherwise provided herein,
no fills toeing out on natural slopes which are steeper than two horizontal to
one vertical (2:1) shall be permitted. The city engineer may approve such fills
toeing out on natural slopes which are steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical (2:1) as deemed appropriate in his or her sole discretion based upon
the circumstances and conditions of the proposed site and fill. Any fill slope
proposed to toe out on natural slopes which are steeper than two horizontal to
one vertical (2:1) shall be supported by documentation and a report prepared
and signed by a professional engineering geologist and soils engineer attesting
to the appropriateness, safety and stability of the proposed fill. Such
documentation and report shall be prepared at the applicant's expense and shall
address the need for and design of necessary measures to provide for the safety
and stability of the proposed fill.
I.   Combined Cut And Fill Slopes: Combined cut and fill slopes shall meet the
requirements of this section insofar as steepness, height, and benching are
concerned except that, where the slope exceeds twenty five feet (25') in
height, the required drainage bench shall be placed at the top of the cut
slope.
J.   Setback: Fill placed on or above the top of an existing or proposed cut or
natural slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3:1) shall be set
back from the top of the slope a minimum distance as required by the uniform
building code, as adopted by the city, or as approved by the city engineer
based upon submitted reports and documentation for the project.
K.   Existing Fills: All existing manmade fills on any and all sites shall be
properly evaluated by a soils engineer. If deficiencies exist, recommendations
and design criteria for corrective measures shall be included within the soils
engineering report.
L.   Measure Of Settlement: The city engineer or the building official may
require the determination of the settlement characteristics of any fills to
establish that any movements have substantially ceased. In such cases, a system
of bench marks shall be installed by a civil engineer or land surveyor at
critical points on the fill, and accurate measurements of both horizontal and
vertical movements shall be taken and evaluated by the soils engineer for a
period of time sufficient to define the settlement behavior. The evaluation
period shall be monitored in accordance with the approved geotechnical report
for the project.
M.   Buttress Fills: All buttress fills shall be designed in accordance with
the land disturbance design and construction standards and the recommendations
and design criteria, including the subdrain system, submitted by the soils
engineer or engineering geologist with the approval of the city engineer. (Ord.
419, 6-5-2001)

established. Temporary irrigation may be required in accordance with the
provisions of this title and the land disturbance design and construction
standards. The developer is responsible for operating and maintaining the
irrigation system. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-100: IDENTIFICATION OF BUILDING ENVELOPE:
The developer shall indicate on the site plan or subdivision plat required for
the site or project, the maximum building envelope, or area of ultimate land/
vegetation disturbance, including designation of the building envelope's
distance from the lot or site boundary lines, which will be caused by the
proposed structure and its appurtenances. Prior to the beginning of any type of
land disturbance or construction on a given lot, the contractor performing the
work is responsible for identifying the building envelope in the field by
marking of the building envelope perimeter. The building official may require
markers to be surveyed when deemed necessary or appropriate. Marking of the
building envelope shall be inspected by the city's community development
department and/or building division prior to commencement of any land
disturbance activity on the lot. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-110: PROPERTY LINE AND CORNER MARKERS:

constructed as part of the project. Slope protection easements shall be
provided either through indicating them on the final plat or by separate
recordable easement acceptable to the city. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-130: LOTS GRADED TOWARD STREET FOR DRAINAGE:
Except as otherwise provided herein, stormwater runoff from individual lots
shall be directed toward the streets at a minimum slope of two percent (2%).
Exceptions may be granted by the city engineer, when deemed appropriate and
necessary, in accordance with the provisions of this section. Aesthetic reasons
such as the creation of view lots shall not constitute sufficient reason for
granting an exception. If the developer finds that draining stormwater toward
the street is unobtainable for a portion or all of the lot, the developer shall
demonstrate to the engineering department that there are no other avenues for
drainage of the stormwater. In such cases, the developer shall prepare a
drainage plan which indicates how the stormwater will be disposed of from the
lot, to either a city owned storm drain, a natural stream or channel, a manmade
channel, other city approved facility or retained on site. The developer is
responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals and permits for the discharge
or retention of stormwater flows. The city engineer will determine if such
alternate drainage is both necessary and appropriate. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-140: LOTS WHICH CANNOT BE GRADED TOWARD THE STREET:
A.   Approval Required: Lots that cannot be drained toward the street, may be
allowed to drain a portion of their stormwater runoff toward the rear of the
yard, after review and approval by the engineering department. Prior to
obtaining this approval, the developer shall prepare a drainage plan, which
indicates how the stormwater will be disposed of from the lot, to either a city
owned storm drain, a natural stream or channel, or manmade channel, or other
city approved facility or retained on site. Such disposal is to be protected by
a drainage easement dedicated for this purpose and the facilities are to be
bonded for.
B.   Swales: Swales located in rear and side yards shall be of materials as
approved by the city that will prevent erosion, and shall be a permanent
feature of the lot and shall be shown in a drainage easement on the site plan
or final plat for the project. An actual design drawing of the swale system
shall be prepared and be included as part of the grading and drainage plan for
the project. If slopes exist between lots, sufficient space shall be allowed to
include a swale at the top of the slope and one at the bottom, all within
dedicated storm drainage easements. Where stormwater is transferred from a lot
of higher elevation, to a lower lot in elevation, sufficient energy dissipation
shall be constructed to reduce the water velocity to an acceptable level.
Engineering calculations are to be submitted to the engineering department
certifying the proposed design of the energy dissipation facilities.
C.   Notice: Swales shall be constructed and in place before building permits
are issued on subdivision lots. The developer shall notify the homebuilders and
homeowners of these drainage swale easements and the need to maintain them both
during and after construction. Homeowners are to be notified by the developer
of the installation of these side and rear yard swales through an acceptable
instrument to the city. A notice of these drainage swale easements shall also
be recorded on the subdivision plat for the project. After completion of the
swales, the homeowners shall be responsible for maintenance of swales.
D.   Bonding: In the event these types of swales are used for the project, the
developer shall provide sufficient bonding of these swales as part of the
city's regular public improvement bonding, to ensure these facilities will be
constructed.
E.   Underground Facilities: The developer may select the option of designing
and constructing underground drainage facilities to replace aboveground
drainage swales if these facilities meet certain city requirements. These
requirements include the design being approved by the engineering department,
inclusion of these facilities within city approved drainage easements,
maintenance of the system by a homeowners' association, and other requirements
as may be deemed necessary by the city. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-150: MATERIALS FOR SIDE AND REAR YARD DRAINAGE:
Side and rear yard swales and drainage facilities shall be designed into
projects as an integral component of the stormwater system of the project which
needs to transfer stormwater runoff from the rear and side yards to the street,
or to other rear yard stormwater facilities. These swales or drain facilities
shall be designed and constructed in such a way that they become a permanent
feature of the side and/or rear yard and shall be constructed of a material as
approved by the city which prevents erosion. Inspections of these swales or
drain facilities shall be conducted by the engineering department during the
subdivision construction phase of the project. Once the subdivision has entered
the warranty period, and building permits are issued, the building division of
the city shall inspect the maintenance and functioning of these lot level
stormwater facilities during lot level development. Developers are to provide
recorded drainage easements wide enough to provide for the possible slight
field relocation of rear and side yard drainage swales, or other drainage
facilities. At a minimum, the drainage easement shall be for the width of the
swale plus two feet (2'). (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-160: FLOW OF WATER FROM ONE LOT TO ANOTHER; LIMITED USE:
In the case where stormwater flow is allowed to flow from a higher lot to a
lower lot, in elevation, sufficient energy dissipation shall be designed and
constructed to reduce the water velocity to an acceptable level to prevent
erosion. The design and construction of these energy dissipation structures
shall be approved by the engineering department in conjunction with the review
and approval of the drainage plan for the project. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-170: LANDSCAPING OF CERTAIN LOTS FOR EROSION CONTROL:
The city reserves the right to require that the lots be revegetated or
stabilized prior to issuance of building permits or that lots be fully
landscaped prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as part of the
requirements of the project. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that,
for certain areas in the city which have soils susceptible to severe erosion,
erosion is controlled. The criteria to be used by the city are the size of the
lot and sizes of adjacent lots, elevation differences between lots, and the
type of soils in the project, along with other factors. A landscaping plan
shall be submitted to the engineering department for approval prior to
commencement of landscaping improvements required hereunder. (Ord. 419, 6-5-
2001)
18-3-180: EROSION CONTROL AND REVEGETATION:
The developer is to indicate erosion control and revegetation BMPs to be used
for the project on the project drawings and as part of the project descriptions
included with the application in accordance with the city's land disturbance
design and construction standards. Erosion and sedimentation control measures
will be inspected upon completion, during construction of the subdivision, and
once the subdivision construction is complete. The engineering department will
be responsible for these inspections. Once the subdivision level construction
is complete and improvement work begins on individual lots, erosion and
sedimentation control BMPs will be inspected prior to any disturbance, during
construction and once lot level construction is complete. The building division
will be responsible for these inspections. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)
18-3-190: WET WEATHER PLAN:
The city engineer may require that land disturbance activities and erosion
control or revegetation plans be modified, if unforeseen delays occur due to
weather generated problems not considered at the time the land disturbance
permit was issued, including submission and approval of a wet weather plan.
(Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)

issued.
B.   Penalties: Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the
provisions of this title shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this code
pursuant to the provisions of this code, and each such person shall be deemed
guilty of a separate offense for each and every day, or portion thereof, during
which any violation of any of the provisions of this title is committed,
continued, or land disturbance permitted.
C.   Letters Of Noncompliance: Whenever any construction or work is being done
contrary to the provisions of this title or any other law, the city engineer or
his/her duly authorized representative may issue a letter of noncompliance. The
letter of noncompliance shall be issued to the developer, the civil engineer,
and the contractor immediately on that portion of the work on which the

corrected, a letter shall be issued stating that the noncompliance has been
rectified, and such letter shall be distributed to the developer, the civil

specifying the place, date, and time of hearing the appeal. (Ord. 419, 6-5-

18-6-120: LIABILITY:
Neither issuance of grading approval under the provisions of this title, nor
compliance with the provisions of this title, or with any conditions imposed in
a land disturbance permit issued under the provisions of this title, is to
relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person or property or
impose any liability upon the city for damage to any person or property. (Ord.
419, 6-5-2001)
18-6-130: RIGHT TO STOP WORK:
Nothing herein is to be construed as indicating that the city cannot
immediately stop the work being performed if, in the opinion of the city
engineer, the damage being done is of such a nature that it requires immediate
cessation of the work. This could result in the bypassing of the normal
processes of notices and increasing levels of enforcement which will typically
be followed. (Ord. 419, 6-5-2001)

A.   Application: Ethics is more than the avoidance of criminal behavior. It is
a commitment for public servants to take individual responsibility in creating
a government that has the trust and respect of its citizens. There needs to be
a proactive approach in strengthening the emphasis on ethics and in guiding
city elected officials and employees in upholding them. To preserve and
maintain the integrity of responsible government and its decision making
process, Draper City believes it is necessary that the identity, activities and
expenditures of certain persons who engage in efforts to influence elected
officials and employees of the city on matters within their official
cognizance, either by direct communication or by solicitation of others to
engage in such efforts, be publicly and regularly disclosed. The provisions and
requirements of this ethics code shall apply to every person who attempts to
influence governmental action, unless such person is clearly exempt by an
express provision hereof.
B.   Goals Specified: With subsection A of this section in mind, Draper City
hereby adopts the following goals for the city's ethics program:
1.   To promulgate and implement a comprehensive approach to ethics and
integrity in Draper City government;
2.   To promote public confidence in elected officials, appointed officials and
employees by fostering the ethical operation of government;
3.   To promote and ensure compliance with local, state, and federal ethics
law;
4.   To centralize laws and regulations on the ethical conduct of city elected
officials, appointed officials and employees;
5.   To heighten knowledge and understanding of the laws and ethical principles
which are the inherent obligations of city elected officials and employees;
6.   To establish a system to train city elected officials, appointed officials
and employees to encourage compliance with these standards and to also provide
for periodic review, and education on ethics;
7.   To enact an ethics officer system that will continue to evolve and update
our city's ethics program and to provide guidance and education to all city
departments; and
8.   To educate city officials and employees to avoid the appearance of
impropriety.
C.   Level Of Ethics: Through this comprehensive ethics code and the related
goals, the city will strive to elevate the level of ethics in local government,
to provide honest and responsible service to the citizens of Draper City, and
to maintain the confidence and trust of the public that this government serves.
