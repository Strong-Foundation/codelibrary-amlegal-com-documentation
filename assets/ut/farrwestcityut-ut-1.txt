the major factor in determining the award of a procurement.
      2.   Contracts shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding except as
otherwise provided by this policy.
      3.   Any procurement in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)
which is not a building improvement or public works project shall require
bidding.
      4.   A request for bids shall be published at least twice in a newspaper
published or of general circulation in the local entity at least five (5) days
before opening the bids; or if there is no newspaper published or of general
circulation in the local entity then posting notice at least five (5) days
before opening the bids in at least five (5) public places in the local entity
and leaving the notice posted for at least three (3) days; and publishing
notice in accordance with section 45-1-101, at least five (5) days before
opening the bids.
      5.   Each notice of a request for bids shall indicate that the City may
reject any or all bids submitted.

correction, except as authorized in this policy. Bids shall be evaluated based
on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids.
      8.   Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or
after award, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes,
shall be permitted. After bid opening no changes in bid prices or other

criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.
      10.   An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other

in whole or in part, as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is in the
best interests of the City. The reasons shall be made part of the contract

submitted, the City Council may undertake the building improvement or public
works project as it considers appropriate.

this section shall not be disclosed without prior written consent by the bidder
or offeror.

price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No
other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file
shall contain the basis on which the award is made.

Requests for such services should be publicly announced. Contracts should be
negotiated by the City based on demonstrated competence at fair and reasonable
prices.

which will promote the best interests of the City may be used, provided that
the use of a cost plus a percentage of cost contract is prohibited. A cost
reimbursement contract may be used only when a determination is made in writing
that such a contract is likely to be less costly to the City than any other
type or that is impracticable to obtain the supplies, services or construction
required except under such a contract.
      9.   Required Contract Clauses:
         a.   The unilateral right of the City to order, in writing, changes in

to have been consummated at the place of business delivered by the retailer or
his or her agent to an out of state destination or to a common carrier for
delivery to an out of state destination. In the event a retailer has no
permanent place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are
consummated shall be as determined under the rules and regulations prescribed

Code Annotated, 1953, the state of Utah is named or referred to as the taxing
agency, the name of this municipality shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in
this subsection shall be deemed to require substitution of the name of the
municipality for the word "state" when that word is used as part of the title
of the state tax commission, or of the constitution of the state of Utah, nor
shall the name of the municipality be substituted for that of the state in any
section when the result of that substitution would require action to the taken
by or against the municipality or any agency thereof, rather than by or against
the state tax commission in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this chapter.
      3.   If an annual license has been issued to a retailer under section 59-
12-106 of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, an additional license shall not be

The council hereby approves and adopts the impact fee facilities plan and the
impact fee analyses (dated November 2013) attached and the analyses reflected

incorporated herein by reference and adopted as though fully set forth herein.
(Ord. 13-09)
3.12.030: IMPACT FEE CALCULATIONS:
   A.   Impact Fees: The impact fees imposed by this chapter shall have two (2)
components: a future facilities impact fee as well as a buy in fee for excess
capacity in existing facilities. The impact fees shall be calculated as set
forth below.
   B.   Sanitary Sewer Fee: Every developer, builder or individual who
develops, improves, or constructs a structure or structures which require a
connection to the sanitary sewer system shall pay to the city a connection fee
as published in the fee schedule (see chapter 3.30 of this title), per
equivalent residential unit.
   C.   Residential Stormwater, Drainage And Flood Control; Parks And Open
Space Fees: Every individual or developer who develops, builds or constructs
structures which increase the number of residential units within the service
area shall pay to the city a fee as published in the fee schedule (see chapter
3.30 of this title) for each residential unit proposed.
   D.   Nonresidential Stormwater, Drainage And Flood Control Fee: Fees shall
be calculated and assessed according to the following formula, except as
provided in this section. The fee required for any improvement shall be equal
to the sum of the area in square feet of any alteration of the natural land
surface by the addition or construction of buildings, sidewalks, driveways,
parking areas, or other improvements having surfaces impervious to water,
multiplied by the fee amount published in the fee schedule (see chapter 3.30 of
this title). Fees shall be calculated and assessed based on the maximum
projected area of the impervious surface.
   E.   Developer Credits/Developer Reimbursements: A developer, including a
school district or charter school, may be allowed a credit against or
proportionate reimbursement of impact fees if the developer dedicates land for
a system improvement, builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement,
or dedicates a public facility that Farr West City and the developer agree will
reduce the need for a system improvement. A credit against impact fees shall be
granted for any dedication of land for, improvement to, or new construction of,
any system improvements provided by the developer if the facilities are system
improvements to the respective utilities, or are dedicated to the public and
offset the need for an identified future improvement.
   F.   Adjustment Of Fees: The council may adjust either up (but not above the
maximum allowable fee) or down the standard impact fees at the time the fee is
charged in order to respond to an unusual circumstance in specific cases and to
ensure that the fees are imposed fairly. The council may adjust the amount of
the fees to be imposed if the fee payer submits studies and data clearly
showing that the payment of an adjusted impact fee is more consistent with the
true impact being placed on the system.
   G.   Impact Fee Accounting: Farr West City shall establish a separate
interest bearing ledger account for the cash impact fees collected pursuant to
this chapter. Interest earned on such account shall be allocated to that
account.

prepare a report generally showing the source and amount of all monies
collected, earned and received by the fund or account and of each expenditure
from the fund or account. The report shall also identify impact fee funds by
the year in which they were received, the project from which the funds were
collected, the capital projects from which the funds were budgeted, and the
projected schedule for expenditure and be provided to the state auditor on the
appropriate form found on the state auditor's website.
      2.   Impact Fee Expenditures: Funds collected pursuant to the impact fees
shall be deposited in such account and only be used by the city to construct
and upgrade the respective facilities to adequately service development
activity or used as otherwise approved by law.

5.04.110: LICENSE FEE FOR NEW BUSINESS:
The license fees for new businesses shall be due and payable on the date that

the refund of any portion of a license fee already paid. (Ord. 91-07)
5.04.120: FEE; DEBT TO CITY:
Every license fee tax or assessment levied by any ordinance of the City and all
interest accruing thereon after the date of the delinquency, and all penalties

the City, the City Council or the Mayor may direct that notice be sent to the
holder(s) of such licenses directing such holder(s) to appear before the City
Council at a definite date and hour to be stated in such notice, and to show
cause, if any, why such license or licenses should not be revoked; provided,
however, that the time set for such appearance by such licensee shall be not
less than five (5) days after the date of mailing such notice, and provided
further, that such notice shall be mailed to such licensee by regular mail,
postage prepaid, and addressed to the address of such licensee as shown on the

5.10.010: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of Farr West City, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   B.   Applicability: Farr West City is approximately four and one- fourth
(41/4) miles long by two (2) miles wide. It is bisected in the middle by
Interstate 15 and Highway 126. The commercial business areas of the city are
located along Highway 126 and the northeastern edge of the city in the Weber
industrial park. Many new and existing residential areas are located in close
proximity to each other (currently zoned R-1-15) along Highway 126 making any
sexually oriented business located there incompatible with residents. The Weber
industrial park, zoned M-2 is zoned for sexually oriented businesses with
restrictions, but with many large businesses such as Kimberly-Clark, Parker
Hannifin, Pacific Cromolox, Associated Food Stores, and any other future
businesses that will locate in the Weber industrial park. Controlling the
negative secondary effects of any future sexually oriented business locating in
the Weber industrial park is of extreme importance to the city council.
   C.   Findings: Based on available evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and reports made
available to the council, and on findings incorporated in various federal and
state court cases, the Farr West council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      2.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      3.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      4.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      5.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      6.   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-
AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
      7.   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      8.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      9.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
      10.   The findings noted in subsections C1 through C9 of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      11.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics,
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      12.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually
oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
      13.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      14.   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      15.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      16.   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      17.   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      18.   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      19.   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 10-04: Ord.

permitted on a property shall be determined on the basis of 100 animal points

by deducting 0.20 acre (approx. 8,700 square feet) from the total acreage
before calculating the animal allowance (e.g., [0.50 acre - 0.20 acre] x 100 =
30 animal points; [1.45 acres - 0.20 acre] x 100 = 125 points). All other
properties shall deduct the exact amount of acreage not being used for animal
production before calculating the animal allowance.

allowance requirements.
   E.   Commercial agricultural production businesses shall only be permitted
in the A-1 residential zone. Intensive commercial agricultural operations or

days from the date of the demand letter, the account will be sent to small
claims court for collection.
      4.   Should it be deemed necessary by the mayor and city council, a lien
will be imposed at that time upon all of the real property on which any use is
made from a sewer connection until all past due accounts of the user are paid
in full.
   M.   Annual Rate Notification: Each user will be notified, at least
annually, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are
attributable to wastewater treatment services (O&M) versus debt service.
   N.   Surcharge; Refund: All nonresidents whose property is contiguous to the
Farr West City boundary and who wish to connect to the sanitary sewer system of

15.22.030: Definitions
15.22.040: Stormwater Utility
15.22.050: Stormwater Utility Fee
15.22.060: Billing
15.22.010: FINDINGS:
The city council makes the following findings regarding stormwater runoff and
the city's stormwater system:
   A.   Facilities: The city's existing stormwater system consists of a network
of manmade and natural facilities, structures, and conduits, including
groundwater and aquifers that collect and route stormwater runoff.
   B.   Endangerment: Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff
endangers the city's groundwater supply.
   C.   Erosion: Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff
causes erosion and property damage.
   D.   Emergency Services: Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater
runoff hinders the city's ability to provide emergency services to its
residents.
   E.   Traffic: Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff
impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city and poses a risk to the
existing road infrastructure.
   F.   Public Health: Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater
runoff poses health hazards to the citizens of the community.
   G.   Pollution: Stormwater runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease,
nutrients, chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials and other undesirable
materials that may jeopardize the integrity of groundwaters and receiving
waters, including the city's culinary water supply.
   H.   Impervious Surfaces: All developed properties in the city contribute to
the need for the stormwater system by converting natural ground cover into
impervious surfaces.
   I.   Maintenance: All developed properties in the city make use of or
benefit from the city's operation and maintenance of the stormwater system.
   J.   Regulations: The environmental protection agency (EPA) and the Utah
department of environmental quality (DEQ) will develop further stormwater
permitting regulations that will apply to local government as unfunded mandated
and otherwise.
   K.   General Operation: Absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation
and control of existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city constitute a
potential hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the city, its
residents, and its businesses.
   L.   Utility Fees: A stormwater utility fee is the most equitable and
efficient method of managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each
property in the city pays its fair prorated share of the amount that the
property contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the stormwater
system. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.22.020: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter and chapters 15.23 through 15.25 of this title is
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by
improving the city's stormwater system, managing and controlling stormwater
runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted waters from entering the
city's water supply and other receiving waters, and establishing a viable and
fair method of financing the construction, operation and maintenance of the
stormwater system. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.22.030: DEFINITIONS:
The words or phrases in this section shall be defined as follows for all
chapters in this code relating to stormwater:
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): A wide range of management procedures,
schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and
other management practices which have been demonstrated to effectively control
the quality and/or quantity of stormwater runoff and which are compatible with
the planned land use. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating
procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or
water disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. A list of sample BMPs
and their effectiveness ratings can be found in the most current version of the
city's stormwater management plan available at the city office or as otherwise
provided.
   CATCH BASIN: A drain inlet designed to keep out large or obstructive matter.
   CITY: Includes the geographical boundaries of Farr West City, Utah, and also
refers to the classification of the jurisdictional area within a municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4).
   CITY COUNCIL: Refers to the legislative body of Farr West City, Utah.
   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT: A development that is contiguous to an area
where multiple separate distinct construction activities may be taking place at
different times or different schedules under one plan. For example, if a
developer buys a twenty (20) acre lot and builds roads, installs pipes, and
runs electricity with the intention of constructing homes or other structures
sometime in the future, this would be considered a common plan of development
or sale. If the land is parceled off or sold, and construction occurs on plots
that are less than one acre by separate, independent builders, this activity
still would be subject to stormwater permitting requirements if the smaller
lots were included on the original site plan. The common plan of development or
sale also applies to other types of land development such as industrial parks
or well fields. A permit is required if one or more acres of land will be
disturbed, regardless of the size of any of the individually owned or developed
sites.
   DEBRIS: Any dirt, rock, sand, vegetation, rubbish or litter.
   DETENTION BASIN: An area designed to detain peak flows from stormwater
runoff and to regulate release rates of that water into the city's storm
drainage system, also allowing debris to settle out. Detention basin outlets
are connected directly to downstream storm drains. All flow entering detention
basins is released via outlet piping. "Regional detention basins" are defined
as large detention basins owned and maintained by the city. "Local detention
basins" are defined as smaller basins typically in subdivisions and constructed
by developers. Following acceptance of the construction, the ownership,
operation and maintenance may either be conveyed and maintained by the city or
owned and maintained by private property owners.
   DEVELOPED PARCEL: Any parcel that has been altered from its natural
condition by grading, filling, or the construction of improvements or other
impervious surfaces.
   DEVELOPMENT OR LAND DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or
unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, site preparation,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, development of a parcel, lot, subdivision
plat or site plan and construction of buildings or other structures.
   DIRECTOR: The public works director, or other person or agent designated by
the city to enforce stormwater regulations adopted by the city.
   DISTURB: To alter the physical condition, natural terrain or vegetation of
land by clearing, grubbing, grading, excavating, filling, building or other
construction activity.
   DRAIN INLET: A point of entry into a sump, detention basin, or storm drain

system, and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains or
sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been previously
allowed, permitted, or approved by a government agency; or
   B.   Any drain or conveyance connected to or discharging to the storm drain
system, which has not been: 1) documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records
submitted to the city, and 2) approved in writing by the city.
   ILLICIT DISCHARGE: Any nonstormwater discharge to the stormwater system.
Illicit discharges include both direct connections (e.g., wastewater piping
either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the stormwater system) and
indirect connections (e.g., infiltration into the stormwater system or spills
collected by drain inlets).
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: Any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that
prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes water
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at greater rates of flow than

   STORMWATER SYSTEM: The system of conveyances (including sidewalks, roads
with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch basins, detention basins,
curbs, gutters, ditches, manmade channels, sumps, storm drains, and
groundwater) owned and operated by the city, which is designed and used for
collecting or conveying stormwater. The stormwater system is also referred to
as MS4.
   SUMP: A city approved formalized underground structure that may be used in
rare situations to act as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water
into the surrounding subsoil. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.22.040: STORMWATER UTILITY:
   A.   Creation: The city council hereby creates and establishes a stormwater
utility as part of the city's overall stormwater system. The stormwater utility
shall plan, design, construct, maintain, administer and operate the city's
stormwater system.
   B.   Funding: The city council hereby establishes a stormwater utility
reserve fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial transactions
related to the stormwater utility. All stormwater utility service charges shall
be deposited in this reserve fund. Money in the stormwater utility shall be
accounted separately and held in reserve separate from general funds. The
stormwater utility may be used to pay for any services and expenses
attributable to stormwater. The city may administer the stormwater utility
reserve fund and an enterprise fund.
   C.   Facilities: The stormwater utility shall operate independently of the
general fund. The stormwater utility shall have the same relationship to the
city as other utilities, such as the water and sanitary sewer. Upon creation of
this utility, all of the city's stormwater facilities (not including streets
and similar facilities as designated by the city council) shall be transferred
to the stormwater utility in consideration for the stormwater utility taking
primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing, maintaining,
administering and operating the stormwater system and facilities.
   D.   Administration: The stormwater utility shall be administered by the
director under the oversight of the city management. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.22.050: STORMWATER UTILITY FEE:
   A.   Imposed: Each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be
charged a stormwater utility fee.
   B.   ERU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential
units (ERUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ERU is
the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel
contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the stormwater utility. Based
on engineer's research, the city council finds and establishes that one ERU
equals two thousand eight hundred (2,800) square feet of impervious surface
area.
   C.   Calculation: The city council finds that:
      1.   Each single-family residential parcel contributes approximately the
same amount of stormwater runoff. Therefore, each developed single-family
residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one ERU.
      2.   All nonsingle-family residential parcels shall pay a multiple of
this base rate, expressed in ERUs, according to the total measured impervious
area on the parcel being imposed a fee.
   D.   Charge Per ERU: The stormwater utility fee as established by the city
council is codified in title 3, chapter 3.30, "Fee Schedule", of this code.
   E.   Exemptions And Credits: The city council may establish exemptions and
credits to the stormwater utility fee by ordinance or resolution.
   F.   Policies: The director may adopt policies and rules, consistent with
this chapter to assist in the application, administration, and interpretation
of this chapter and any other chapter related to the stormwater.
   G.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter, or any
stormwater utility rate, was interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal to
the city's appeal authority. The appeal shall be in writing, shall state any
facts supporting the appeal, and shall be made within ten (10) days of the
decision, action, or bill being appealed. All appeals shall be handled in
accordance with the procedure in this code for the appeal authority. The
decision of the appeal authority shall be final. (Ord. 2014-07: Ord. 2012-05)
15.22.060: BILLING:
The city council finds that the city's stormwater system, sanitary sewer
system, culinary water system, and solid waste collection system are
interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally
responsible manner. Billing shall be as follows:
   A.   Utilities And Fees: City utility billing is completed in conjunction
with the regular monthly billing statement of Bona Vista water district who
shall bill on behalf of the city for:
      1.   Sanitary sewer;
      2.   Solid waste collection and disposal;
      3.   Enhanced services;
      4.   Franchise fees if imposed;
      5.   Stormwater; and
      6.   An administrative cost per bill.
   B.   General Provisions: The following general provisions apply:
      1.   If there is no regular utility bill for the property, there is no
city utility imposed for stormwater.
      2.   A utility fee is a civil debt owed to the city by the person or
entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property.
      3.   All properties receiving Bona Vista water service shall be charged
the applicable city utilities specified in this part, including the stormwater
fee, regardless of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property
requests the stormwater utility service.
      4.   Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in
termination of water service.
   C.   Billing Changes: The city council may modify, reduce, impose, or rebate
erroneous billing charges not to exceed a period of three (3) months. The mayor
may make special exceptions on billing charges for special circumstances as
recommended by the director. (Ord. 2012-05)

15.23.040: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
Any person connecting to the stormwater system or developing a commercial or
industrial site shall employ best management practices (BMPs) approved by the
city. The city shall adopt a policy establishing a menu of BMPs that may be
used to satisfy this requirement. The BMPs may be structural and/or
nonstructural depending on the needs of the site. The BMPs shall be designed to
ensure that the quality and quantity of stormwater released to the city's
stormwater system meets the requirements of federal, state, local law,
regulations, and the city's NPDES permit, and will not exceed the designed
capacity of the stormwater system or jeopardize the integrity of the stormwater
system. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.23.050: EASEMENTS:
The director may enter all private properties through which the city holds an
easement for the purposes of inspecting, observing, measuring, sampling,
repairing or maintaining any portion of the stormwater facilities lying within
the easement, or the performance of any other duties pertinent to the operation
of the stormwater system. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on an
easement, shall be completed according to any special terms of the easement.
(Ord. 2012-05)
15.23.060: AUTHORITY TO INSPECT:
   A.   Inspections: Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any
provision of this chapter, or whenever the city has cause to believe that there
exists, or potentially exists, a condition which constitutes a violation of
this chapter, the city may direct its qualified personnel to enter the premises
at all reasonable times to inspect, detect, investigate, eliminate, and enforce
any suspected nonstormwater discharges, including illegal dumping, into the
city's stormwater system. During the same time the city may inspect and copy
records related to stormwater compliance. In the event the owner or occupant
refuses entry after a request to enter and inspect has been made, the city is
hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in
obtaining such entry.
   B.   Access: The access for the city to inspect stormwater control measures
on private property that is vested subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter includes both construction phase and postconstruction access. Upon
approval of the director, and in lieu of city employees inspecting and
maintaining stormwater controls on private property, the city may allow the
owner/operators or a qualified third party to conduct maintenance so long as:
      1.   At least annual certification, in the form of inspection
documentation which has been performed, is provided to the city.
      2.   The structural controls are adequately operating and maintained as
such were designed to protect water quality as provided in the original
maintenance agreement and plans submitted upon vesting and approval of the
site.
   C.   Agreement: A maintenance agreement is required on private property that
is vested subsequent to the effective date of this chapter and includes both
construction phase and postconstruction access and where owner/operators or a
qualified third party are to conduct maintenance as provided herein. Said
maintenance agreement shall be promulgated in the form and manner as determined
by the director so long as the agreement at a minimum:
      1.   Allows the city oversight authority of the stormwater measures.
      2.   Includes a provision that the agreement acts as a covenant that runs
with the land.
      3.   Allows the city to perform necessary maintenance or corrective
actions neglected by the owner/operators or the qualified third party.
      4.   Allows the city to recoup the costs from the owner/operator as
necessary to cover the expenses for necessary actions conducted by the city.
   D.   Interpretation: The city interprets this regulation as secondary and
subservient to the United States constitution and the Utah state constitution
as applied to property rights, land use, development, and similar rights.
Specifically, the intent of this regulation is not to be applied to violate
vested, property rights nor to be a physical invasion of property rights as
determined by the United States supreme court in Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The city recognizes that the United
States supreme court interprets property right in conjunction with the laws and
constitutions of each state. Therefore, Utah law also plays an important role
in defining property rights. For the purpose of determining when a property
right is vested the city shall continue to apply the Utah supreme court ruling
in Western Land Equities, Inc. v. City Of Logan, 617 P.2d 388 (1980) that
states a property owner is vested to follow the city's regulations in effect at
the time a land use application is filed. Furthermore, where there is vagueness
in any land use regulation, including the stormwater regulations, it shall be
interpreted in favor of the property owner. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.23.070: REQUIREMENT TO MONITOR AND ANALYZE:
If city tests or inspections indicate that a site is causing or contributing to
stormwater pollution, illegal discharges, and/or nonstormwater discharges to
the stormwater system or waters of the United States, and if the violations
continue after notice from the city, the city may require any person engaged in
the illicit activity and/or the owner or operator of the site to provide, at
their own expense, monitoring and analyses required by the city to determine
compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.23.080: VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT:
Whenever the city finds that a person, organization, or institution has
violated a prohibition or failed to comply with a requirement of this chapter,
the city will order compliance by the following procedure:
   A.   Warning: A verbal warning shall be given. The verbal warning shall be
documented in the city records by the qualified person (code enforcement
officer, city inspector, public works employee) who issued the warning. The
city may skip the requirements set forth in this subsection and immediately
proceed with other more severe actions against the violator if the following
may have occurred:
      1.   The violator has committed the same violation in the past.
      2.   The violation, in the opinion of the city, creates a serious risk to
persons, the environment or property.
      3.   The city deems the violation to constitute an emergency.
   B.   Written Violation: Issue a written notice of violation to the
responsible person(s), company or institution. The notice of violation may be

      2.   The violation, in the opinion of the city, creates a serious risk to
persons, the environment or property.
      3.   The city deems the violation to constitute an emergency.
   D.   Penalty: The following penalties apply for each written violation:
      1.   Criminal: The violation of any provision of any chapter relating to
stormwater is a class B misdemeanor. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
      2.   Civil: In addition to other penalties and remedies, any person,
firm, corporation, principal, agent, employee, contractor, or other party
violating or permitting the violation of any governing stormwater regulation is
subject to a civil fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), per
violation, per day, in addition to reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred
by the city for enforcement of stormwater regulations.
      3.   Damage Recovery: The city is entitled to seek and receive damages
equal to the cost to make all repairs and/or replace any materials in addition
to any criminal or civil fines and/or penalties imposed.

15.24.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this chapter is to prevent the discharge of sediment and other
construction related pollutants from construction sites. Sediment and debris
from construction sites are a major source of pollution to waterways and water
systems located within the city and surrounding areas. Each year stormwater
runoff carries tons of sediment from construction sites into local drainage
systems, irrigation systems, canals, rivers, and lakes. Sediment from
stormwater runoff also clogs and obstructs storm drains, culverts, canals, and
may cause damage to private property, wildlife habitat, or water quality. (Ord.
2012-05)
15.24.020: ACTIVITY PERMIT REQUIRED:
A stormwater construction activity permit is required before any person or
entity may excavate, grub and clear, grade, or perform any type of construction
activity that will disrupt or cause a change in the natural landscape upon any
of the following types of property located within the city:
   A.   One Acre Plus: Any parcel, lot, development, or "common plan of
development" which is equal to or greater than one acre (43,560 square feet) in
size.
   B.   Subdivisions: A subdivision development greater than or equal to one
acre in size qualifies under this subsection even if each of the individual
lots in the subdivision are smaller than one acre.
   C.   Special Areas: Any parcel, lot, or development or "common plan of
development" the city determines that because of the nature or type of the
parcel, lot, or development that there may occur a disturbance of land that may
likely result in erosion or the transport of sediment off of the site by
stormwater to a degree substantially greater than that which would occur under
natural landscape conditions. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.24.030: ACTIVITY PERMIT APPLICATION:
Any person or entity desiring a stormwater construction activity permit must
first file an application with the city. The application shall be submitted
with, or as part of an application for a site plan or subdivision approval or
building permit. Any person or entity desiring a stormwater construction
activity permit must also submit a "notice of intent" (NOI) with the state of
Utah.
   A.   Content: The application shall include a stormwater pollution
prevention plan which meets the criteria set forth in section
15.24.040 of this chapter.
   B.   Timing: The applicant shall file the application on or before the
following dates:
      1.   Subdivision: The date that the applicant submits the preliminary
subdivision plat application if the applicant proposes to develop a
subdivision.
      2.   Site Plan: The date that the applicant submits a site plan
application if the applicant proposes to develop a site plan or amended site
plan.
      3.   Building Permit: The date that the applicant submits a building
permit application if the applicant proposes to construct a building on an
existing lot or parcel.
      4.   Other: At least two (2) weeks before the developer intends to
perform any type of work not listed above that would require a stormwater
construction activity permit in accordance with this chapter.
   C.   Compliance: If an applicant's development comes under more than one of
the categories listed above, then the applicant shall submit the stormwater
construction activity permit application on the earliest of the listed dates.
Failure to comply with the application dates set forth above is not a criminal
offense, but will delay the applicant's project. Failure to acquire a required
stormwater construction activity permit is grounds for denying a related
subdivision application, site plan application, conditional use permit
application, or building permit application. It is unlawful to commence work
(move dirt) on a development site before obtaining a required stormwater
construction activity permit.
   D.   Fee: The applicant for a stormwater construction activity permit shall
pay a fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council.
   E.   Application Approval: The city administrative staff shall approve the
application and grant the permit if the application is complete and meets the
criteria set forth in section
15.24.040 of this chapter. The city administrative staff shall deny the
application or approve the application with conditions if the city
administrative staff determines that the measures proposed in the stormwater
pollution prevention plan fail to meet the criteria set forth in section
15.24.040 of this chapter. Conditions the city administrative staff may impose
in connection with the approval of a permit include, but are not limited to,
the establishment of specific measures and controls to prevent erosion and the
discharge of sediment, debris and other construction related pollutants from
the site by stormwater.
   F.   Term: Unless otherwise revoked or suspended, a stormwater construction
activity permit shall be in effect for the full period of the construction
activity. The construction activity will not be considered to be completed
until the following events occur:
      1.   Subdivisions: For permits associated with a subdivision plat
approval:
         a.   The permittee must complete all required subdivision
improvements.
         b.   One of the following three (3) events must occur:
            (1)   The city issues a final certificate of occupancy for each lot
in the subdivision.
            (2)   An individual stormwater construction activity permit is
issued for each lot in the subdivision not having a final occupancy permit.
            (3)   The property has been revegetated or landscaped in a manner
that eliminates erosion and sediment discharge or that brings the property back
to its natural state.
      2.   Site Plans: For permits associated with a site plan approval, the
date that the permittee has completed all required landscaping and all outside
construction work associated with the site plan.
      3.   Building Permits: For permits associated with a building permit
application, the date that the city issues a final occupancy permit for the
structure covered by the building permit.

15.25.060: Permits And Practices
15.25.070: Violations And Penalties
15.25.010: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Findings: The city council finds:
      1.   The city faces unique stormwater challenges as shown on the city's
sensitive lands overlay in the city's general plan.
      2.   The city is impacted by watercourses and multiple drainageways.
      3.   The city is impacted by stormwater and runoff and nonsource point
pollution from parking lots, residential uses, commercial uses, and industrial
activity and such pollution presents a hazard for the health, safety, and
welfare of the public in this community.
      4.   There exists in the city a high groundwater table that precludes
certain stormwater control measures and necessitates extensive storm drain
design, open space preservation, construction standards, and policies as set
forth in this chapter.
   B.   Purpose: This chapter represents the construction standards for private
and public construction as it relates to storm drainage within the city.
   C.   Conformance: All efforts have been made for this policy to conform with
the requirements of phase II of the federal clean water act, and the city's
stormwater management plan.
   D.   Outline: The following information is organized in such a way to follow
the natural flow of stormwater, from the initial rainfall hydrology (section
15.25.020 of this chapter), to conveying the rainwater (section
15.25.030 of this chapter), to a basin (section
15.25.040 of this chapter), then discharging to a natural outlet location
(section
15.25.050 of this chapter). Permits and practices (section 15.25.060 of this
chapter), and penalties for violations (section
15.25.070 of this chapter) are also discussed.
   E.   Definitions: The definitions specified in chapter 15.22 of this title
apply to all stormwater regulations in this code. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.25.020: RAINFALL HYDROLOGY:
   A.   Policy: All storm drain systems shall be designed to carry the 100-year
storm.
   B.   Storm Specifications: Local storm drain piping shall be designed for
the 10-year storm where the road or other aboveground conveyance will carry the
difference to the 100-year storm. All basins regardless of local or regional,
or retention or detention, shall be designed to accommodate a 100-year storm
event. The storm duration used for the sizing of basins shall be based upon the
worst case scenario and not the time of concentration.
   C.   Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF): For the use of the "rational
method", an IDF curve shall be obtained from the city engineer for the project
location.
   D.   Calculation Basis: For single site plans and small subdivisions, the
rational equation may be used. For larger sites a city engineer approved
computer model shall be used.
   E.   Rainfall Pattern: For the use of computer models, the following
rainfall pattern shall be used. This pattern is based upon the "Farmer-Flecher
distribution". This pattern is for a one inch (1") unit storm and must be
multiplied by rainfall depth for storms of other magnitudes.
   F.   Rainfall Total: For the use of the following rainfall pattern, a
rainfall total from the "NOAA atlas" must be obtained. Such total shall be
based upon a 1-hour storm as follows:
1  0     11 0.004 21 0.033 31 0.052 41 0.012 51 0.005

(Ord. 2012-05)
15.25.025: LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Guide Adopted: The Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) "A
Guide to Low Impact Development within Utah" (Guide) dated December 2018, to
implement Low Impact Development (LID) standards, is hereby adopted by Farr
West City and incorporated herein by this reference.
   B.   Report: A storm water quality report, following the template provided
in guide and as may be further defined by the city engineer, shall be submitted
to the city engineer for each development or subdivision submitted to the city
for approval.
   C.   Standards: The following LID standards, which may be further defined in
the public works standards and technical specifications of the city, shall be
implemented into each development to the greatest extent practicable as
approved by the city engineer.
      1.   Pervious Surfaces: Pervious surfaces such as permeable pavement,
concrete pavers, pervious concrete, modular open pavers, and other types of
pervious surfaces that provide structural support for light vehicle and/or
pedestrian traffic while also providing open space for storm water
infiltration.
      2.   Infiltration Basin: Infiltration basins are shallow depressions
using existing soils to retain and provide treatment for storm water runoff by
capturing and infiltrating runoff over a specified draw-down time.
      3.   Infiltration Trench: An infiltration trench is a linear excavation
backfilled with a combination of gravel, open grade stone, and sand layers that
provides storage within the pore space of the specified layers.
      4.   Harvest System: A harvest and reuse system refers to any type of
runoff collection system that captures rainfall, stores it temporarily, and
reuses it for irrigation, landscaping, or other non-potable use.
      5.   Underground Collection Galleries: A storm drain collection system
which can be used under parking lots or grass surfaces to retain or detain
stormwater and allow for infiltration or controlled release.
      6.   Other: Other methods may be reviewed and approved by the city
engineer as technology is developed for low impact design, except those that
provide underground storage.
   D.   Feasibility: If meeting the standards described in 15.25.021 is
infeasible, a rationale shall be provided for the use of alternative design
criteria. The new or redevelopment project must document and quantify that
infiltration, evapotranspiration, and rainwater harvesting have been used to
the maximum extent feasible and that full employment of these controls are
infeasible due to constraints. The infeasibility of following the LID standards
may be due to one or more of the following conditions: high groundwater,
drinking water source protection areas, incompatible soil conditions, slopes,
accessibility, excessive cost, or others approved by Farr West City. (Ord. 20-
06)
15.25.030: STORM DRAIN SYSTEM:
   A.   Policy: It is the policy of the city that:
      1.   Stormwaters not be carried in irrigation ditches, nor that
irrigation water be conveyed in storm drain systems.
      2.   Local pipes shall be sized for the 10-year storm event, however, all
basins and other aboveground stormwater facilities shall be designed and
constructed to manage the difference for the 100-year storm event.
   B.   Piping: Storm drain lines shall be concrete pipe (NRCP or RCP), of
appropriate class. Minimum size for storm sewer mains shall be fifteen inch
(15") diameter. Pipe specifications are included in the city's public works
standard and technical specifications. Where determined by the city engineer,
larger drain lines shall be installed to accommodate future development.
   C.   System Design And Costs: The cost to provide adequate storm drainage to
a development shall be paid for by the developer. Structures shall be installed
in accordance with the standard drawings.
   D.   Access: Storm drain lines shall have cleanout boxes, inlets or manholes
installed at all changes in grade or alignment, with a maximum distance of four
hundred feet (400') between accesses. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.25.040: BASINS:
   A.   Policy: It is the policy of the city to require storm drainage basins
for all development.
   B.   Basin Size And Location: All new development and redevelopment sites
are required to have a stormwater detention system designed as provided in this
chapter. It is critical for developments that are in close proximity to a
stream or river, or within "drinking water source protection zones" 1 or 2 as
defined by the "state division of drinking water rules". All detention basin
designs and calculations shall be reviewed by the city engineer for approval.
   C.   Certain Development Requirement: On site detention is required for all
commercial, manufacturing, industrial, or similar development in the city.
   D.   Ownership: The ownership of stormwater basins is specified as follows:
      1.   Private Basins: Where the development will have a homeowners'
association (HOA) or in commercial applications, local detention basins shall
be owned and maintained by the owner or HOA.
      2.   Local Public Or Private Basins: In subdivisions, local detention
basins shall be constructed by the developer. Following acceptance of the
construction, the ownership, operation, and maintenance may either be conveyed
and maintained by the city or HOA under an appropriate maintenance agreement.
      3.   Regional Detention Basins: Regional basins shall be owned and
maintained by the city and constructed according to the criteria given herein
and approved by the city engineer. Actual ownership and responsibility shall be
specifically defined in the owner dedication certificates, development
agreements, or deed.
   E.   Basin Access And Setback: Basin access shall be as follows:
      1.   Public Basins: The developer shall provide the city ingress and
egress easements for construction, operation, service, maintenance, and repair
for any public basin.
      2.   Private Basin: The owner or owning association shall be provided
ingress and egress easements for construction, operation, service, maintenance,
and repair for any private basin. The city shall be provided an emergency
easement for emergency access, service, and repair for a private basin.
      3.   Setback: Each basin shall be constructed with a flat rim circling
the basin which shall be set back from a property line, adjoining property, and
from any structure an appropriate distance determined by the city engineer to
prevent erosion, and to allow for a backhoe and dump truck to circle the rim
for maintenance and repair.
   F.   Percolation: No reduction due to percolation for detention basins
volumes shall be permitted in design, due to the nature of basins silting in
over time and also possible frost conditions during a storm.
   G.   Basin Construction: Basins shall be constructed as follows:
      1.   Policy: Basins must be constructed to enhance safety, health and
aesthetics of the area.
      2.   Engineering: Basins, whether detention or retention, must be
designed and stamped by a licensed civil engineer.
      3.   Location: Detention basins shall be located with convenient access
for maintenance and repair by maintenance personnel. This generally means that
the basin property has frontage along a public roadway. Volume in ditches or
roadside swales shall not be considered in the volume calculation.
      4.   Fencing: If unfenced and open to general public, the maximum depth
of water should not exceed three feet (3'). If a fence is required, six foot
(6') chainlink fencing is to be installed in accordance with the city's public
works standards and technical specifications, or as may more specifically be
stated in any land use regulations.
      5.   Side Slopes: Side slopes should not exceed 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical) (4.5:1 is desirable) for ease of mowing and access.
      6.   Bottom Slope: The basin floor shall be designed so as to prevent the
permanent ponding of water. The slope of the floor of the basin shall not be
less than one percent (1%) to provide drainage of water to the outlet grate and
prevent prolonged wet, soggy or unstable soil conditions. The preferred minimum
slope is two percent (2%).
      7.   Freeboard: There should be at least one foot (1') of freeboard (berm
above the high water mark).
      8.   Spillways: Spillways must be included and a path with a maintained
swale and drainage easement to a safe location. Attention should be given to
the design of the spillway to avoid erosion. Overflow spillways are intended to
introduce flows back into the main pipe and are typically downstream of the
outlet control. Emergency spillways are intended to carry flows beyond the
capacity of the overflow spillway to a safe downstream location. All spillways
shall be designed to protect adjacent embankments, nearby structures, and
surrounding properties.
      9.   Outlet Control: Small, local, private detention basins may be
allowed to have calculated fixed orifice plates mounted on the outlet of the
basin. Large, regional, public detention basins shall have movable screw type
head gates (Waterman C-10 OAE) set at a calculated opening height for the
discharge and with a chain to fix the position.
      10.   Grates: All grates on inlets and outlets must be hot dipped
galvanized (not painted) with bars at spacing to prohibit feet from falling in
and yet avoid clogging with debris. Generally bar spacing should never exceed
three inch (3") spacing.
      11.   Low Flow Piping: The inlet and outlet structures may be located in
different areas of the basin, requiring a buried pipe to convey any base flows
that enter and exit the basin, rather than a cross gutter or surface flow. The
minimum pipe size and material for the low flow shall be twelve inch (12")
diameter or as approved by the city engineer.
      12.   Ground Covers: The surface area of the basin may either be seeded,
sodded, or covered with fabric and cobbles, as specified by the city. If
seeded, measures shall be taken to eliminate erosion until grasses are
established. A minimum of four inches (4") of topsoil must be installed prior
to sod or seed placement. Cobble sizes shall be four inches (4") or greater in
size overlying a city approved weed barrier. Cobble rock may be permitted if
the basin is fenced and no other alternative purpose is proposed for the land.
Grass or hydroseeding on all basins shall be installed in accordance with the
city's public work standards and technical specifications. The basin shall be
provided with an automated sprinkler system previously approved by the city
engineer. Landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the applicable
landscaping regulations.
      13.   Embankment (Fill) Construction: If a raised embankment is
constructed for a basin (constructed with granular materials), it shall be
provided with a minimum of six inches (6") of clay cover on the inside of the
berm to prevent water passage through the soil.
      14.   Excavation (Cut) Construction: If the basin is constructed
primarily by excavation, then it may be necessary to provide an impermeable
liner and land drain system when constructed in the proximity of basements or
other below grade structures as determined by a geotechnical evaluation.
      15.   Multiuse Basins: Basins may be designed as multiuse facilities when
appropriate precautions are incorporated into the design. If amenities such as
pavilions, playground equipment, volleyball courts, or other amenity are to be
constructed within the water detention area of a basin they shall be designed
appropriately. Structures shall be designed for saturated soil conditions and
bearing capacities are to be reduced accordingly. Restrooms shall not be
located in areas of inundation. Inlet and outlet structures should be located
as far as possible from all facilities. No woodchips or floatable objects may
be used in the area that will be inundated.
   H.   Detention Volume: Detention basins shall be sized based upon the
criteria set forth in section
15.25.020 of this chapter. Detention basins are designed to allow a
predetermined amount of flow to discharge during and after a storm event as
discussed above. Detention basins are preferred over retention basins. No
groundwater injection is allowed. Above grade detention basins are preferred
over below grade basins, yet both are allowable. Discharge rates shall comply
with section
15.25.050 of this chapter.
   I.   Retention Basins: The following applies to retention basins:
      1.   Policy: Regional retention basins shall not be permitted by the
city. It is the policy of the city to prohibit local or private retention
basins for developments, unless certain criteria are met.
      2.   Retention Discouraged: Any retention basin must be specifically
approved by the city engineer. Retention basins shall not be permitted within
zones 1, 2, or 3 of any "drinking water source protection zone" of any drinking
water source. Due to the silting in potential, no percolation rate may be used
in the calculation of volume unless an approved oil/sand separator is installed
upstream. The volume must be based upon the 100-year, 3-hour storm. Local storm
retention basins shall be designed for the 100-year, 3-hour storm, based upon
the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve for the area as approved by the
city engineer. Local basins are typically private ownership and maintenance,
and serve only one or two (2) specified subdivisions or sites as may be
approved.
      3.   Retention Basin Criteria: Retention basins are basins which hold and
store water until it is evaporated or percolated, and shall not be permitted
for developments unless all the following conditions are met:
         a.   The basin is greater than five hundred feet (500') or fifty feet
(50') times the number of lots in the entire development (whichever is greater)
from the city storm drain system or waterway, and is topographically capable of
draining to the city system.
         b.   The basin is not located within a hazardous area such as a steep
slope, floodplain, high groundwater area, "drinking water source protection
zone", or some other hazard area.
      4.   Percolation For Basins: The percolation rate of the ambient soils
may be permitted in the calculations only if an oil/sand separator is installed
upstream and only ten percent (10%) of the percolation rate may be used due to
eventual silting in of the basin.
   J.   Standing Water: The following regulations apply to standing water:
      1.   It is the policy of the city to eliminate standing water wherever
possible as an effort to minimize a mosquito problem and associated viruses,
except where wetland protection is enforced.
      2.   Basins should completely drain within forty eight (48) hours of the
primary storm event.
      3.   Low flow bypass pipes may be required.
   K.   Ground Surface Improvements: It is the city policy that the finished
surface of the basin shall be improved to eliminate erosion and dust and to
enhance the aesthetics of the area by being appropriately landscaped with
approved plant material, landscape material, and approved trees. All basins
shall be fully landscaped or constructed in accordance with any applicable
landscaping regulations. (Ord. 2012-05)
15.25.050: DISCHARGE:
   A.   Policy: It is the policy of the city to control stormwater at the
source and minimize the potential for flooding downstream.
   B.   Requirements: The following requirements apply:
      1.   Storm Drainage: Storm drainage leaving a site or subdivision shall
not exceed, as much as practicable, the predeveloped quantities and qualities
at a maximum rate as follows:
         a.   Allowable Discharge: The allowable discharge rate from any
nonregional basin shall:
            (1)   Prehard Surfacing Discharge: Not exceed the prehard surfacing
discharge for the entire site for the 100-year storm event.
            (2)   Maximum Discharge Rate: Not exceed the maximum discharge rate
set by the city engineer depending on the proposal, the facts and circumstances
of the basin, and historical flow, and the drainage within the surrounding
area. If no maximum discharge rate is established then the standard discharge
rate of 0.1 cubic feet per second per total acre within the development
draining to the basin shall be applied.
            (3)   Controlled Discharge: Controlled discharge may be established
through an orifice or adjustable gate as approved by the city engineer.
            (4)   Flow Concentration: By nature of development, flows are
concentrated to one or more locations where historically sheet flow in lower
concentrations may have left the site. Attempts shall be made to minimize the
runoff concentrated quantity to the flows stated above by use of detention
basins, downstream piping to safe areas or other methods as deemed necessary by
the city engineer.
      2.   Water Quality: Best management practices (BMPs) shall be used to the
maximum extent practicable to ensure healthy water quality based upon national
standards for the same. BMPs are included in the city's stormwater management
plan and must be approved by the city engineer.
      3.   Irrigation Facilities: No stormwater discharge shall be permitted to
irrigation ditches and canals, except where such ditch or canal has had
historical use only for storm drainage or was an irrigation facility that has
been wholly converted to only stormwater use. Irrigation facilities are vested
rights under state law and protected against all encroachment, therefore,
written permission is required in accordance with Utah Code Annotated section
73-1-15 from the owner or operator of any irrigation ditch or canal before any
construction activity that affects an irrigation facility.
      4.   Parking Lots: No parking lot, including sidewalks and all other
impervious surfaces, shall be used for stormwater storage of any kind, above or
below surface.
      5.   Basin Overflows: Attention shall be given to overflow locations and
pathways to safe locations downstream as discussed above. Easement shall be
obtained and pipes or swales sized to handle the 100-year flow. (Ord. 20-05:

         b.   Click on "online application process notice of intent".
         c.   The appropriate fee must be paid to the state.
         d.   An SWPPP must be prepared and on site for this application.
      3.   Stream Alteration Permit: A stream alteration permit is filed with
the Utah department of natural resources, division of water rights.
         a.   This permit overlaps the 404 wetlands permit, discussed below,
because it is applicable to the area equal to the stream plus two (2) times the
bank full width (up to 30 feet).
         b.   Any modifications to the stream or banks within this area must
comply with the stream alteration permit.
      4.   EPA 404 Wetlands Permit: This permit is filed with the U.S. army
corps of engineers. It is applicable for all wetlands within a development.
         a.   This will apply to all wetlands depending upon the presence of
water, soil type and vegetation.
         b.   As part of this permit, a wetlands delineation report with USACE
acceptance letter is required.
         c.   The scope of this permit applies to all jurisdictional waters of

particulates down to one hundred fifty (150) microns. Possible products
include, but are not limited to: BaySaver, Stormceptor, Vortechnic.
         a.   Where oil separators are required, sizing and design of OWS must
be reviewed by the city engineer prior to installation. Consideration must be
given to frequency and ease of maintenance of the structure. Private basins
shall have contracts in place with a local sewer company to periodically clean
the separator in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
         b.   Manufacturer's recommendations for sizing must be followed with
calculations submitted to the city. The separator may either be installed
upstream or downstream of the basin keeping in mind that flows on the outlet of
the basin would be smaller.
      4.   Inlet Protection (IP): The city's stormwater management plan may
permit straw bails, silt fences, or curb snakes (after asphalt is placed).
Filter fabric under the grate shall not be permitted since drainage is greatly
inhibited.
      5.   Tracking Pads (CR): Sites must have a tracking pad to eliminate mud
from being tracked onto the adjacent street. If mud is tracked, the contractor
shall be responsible to sweep the streets as necessary.
      6.   Street Sweeping (SC): If mud is tracked onto the street, the
developer or owner shall be responsible for sweeping the street.
      7.   Concrete Washout (CWM): A place must be located within the
subdivision or on the site for concrete washout. No washout will be permitted
on the street which would then continue to the storm drain. The washout area
may need to be maintained and temporarily excavated until the building
foundations and driveways are constructed, or some other arrangement made.
      8.   Silt Fences (SF): Silt fences must be installed to prohibit the flow
of sediments off of the site in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations
and the city's stormwater management plan.
   D.   Notice Sign: All subdivisions, except minor lot subdivisions, are
required to have at least one large notice sign that is clearly visible at the
entryway of the subdivision indicating that the SWPPP must be obtained and
followed. Said sign shall be maintained by the original subdivision applicant
until conditional acceptance of the subdivision. The specific wording on the
sign relating to stormwater and other related development requirement may be
prescribed and modified by the administration as needed to meet challenges
created by development and to give notice to requirements of law. (Ord. 2012-

   A.   At the time of presenting the preliminary plan to the planning
commission, the subdivider shall pay the Farr West City recorder a
nonrefundable processing fee as prescribed in the fee schedule (see title 3,
chapter 3.30 of this code).
   B.   Phase developments will be charged a fee for the overall preliminary
plan (see title 3,
chapter 3.30, "Fee Schedule", of this code), and each individual phase will pay
the regular processing fees.
   C.   In the event that action of the appeal authority is required, an
additional fee shall be paid as prescribed in the fee schedule.
   D.   Any revision of original plans which require planning commission action
shall be charged an additional fee as prescribed in the fee schedule.
   E.   The payment of any fees above prescribed shall not constitute or imply
in any way that the subject subdivision has been or will be approved. The fees
herein prescribed and paid shall in no event be refundable. (Ord. 2024-06: Ord.
13-05: Ord. 2012-02)
16.12.020: SUBDIVISION PLAT APPLICATION AND ENGINEERING FEES:
   A.   The Farr West City council directs that the engineering review system,
as provided by Farr West City for all new developments proposed within the
city, be based on a user fee.
   B.   The engineering review provided to the city for the purpose of
development review shall be outlined in the adopted engineering services
contract, as amended.
   C.   The engineering review fees shall cover the cost of the associated
professional services rendered to the city by the consultant engineer during
the development approval period. The "development approval period" shall be
defined as that period beginning with the preliminary development application
with the city through final approval by the city council. This does not cover
user fees associated with the actual construction period.
   D.   The engineering review fees as prescribed in the fee schedule (see
title 3,
chapter 3.30 of this code) shall be payable to the city at the time of the
preliminary site plan approval application. The potential development will not
be placed on the planning commission agenda until the fees are paid in advance.
The engineering review fees shall be based on: 1) the subdivision developments,
and 2) the site plan reviews. These fees shall be considered by the city as a
"deposit" against the actual cost of the services provided by the city engineer
during the development review period. Following final approval by the city
council of the subdivision or the site plan, the city recorder will provide an
accounting of the costs incurred during the development review process. If the
costs incurred are less than the fee collected, the balance of the funds in the
account will be refunded to the developer/subdivider. If the costs incurred are
more than the amount of the collected fee, then the developer/subdivider will
be required to pay to the city the deficient amount. The city will not record
the final subdivision plat or issue building permits until deficient fees have
been paid.
   E.   Should the developer/subdivider decide to abandon the proposed
development after the payment of the review fees, the city recorder will
provide an accounting of the costs incurred to date during the development
review process. If the costs incurred are less than the fee collected, the
balance of the funds in the account will be refunded to the developer/
subdivider. If the costs incurred are more than the amount of the collected
fee, then the developer/subdivider will be required to pay to the city the
deficient amount.
   F.   The developer/subdivider, at the time of the payment of the review fee
deposit, shall sign an acknowledgment that he understands the city engineering
review system and he agrees to abide by the requirements. Should the city be
required to employ legal means to collect deficient user fees, the developer/
subdivider will pay all associated legal and collection fees required for
collection. (Ord. 2024-06: Ord. 2012-02)

all the same requirements as the preliminary application, plus the requirements
listed in sections
16.24.030 and
16.24.040 of this Title and the requirement in
16.14.090.H.2 that the applicant attend all public meetings held to discuss the
applicant's preliminary application. The City may, however, waive the final
plat requirement for minor subdivisions as authorized by
chapter 16.20 of this Title.
   D.   City staff (under the direction of the Planning Commission) shall
produce, maintain, and make available to the public a list of the specific
items that comprise complete preliminary and final applications and a breakdown

ensure compliance with City ordinances and approved standards and
specifications for construction of public improvements. (Ord. 2024-06)
16.14.070: PRE-APPLICATION MEETING:
   A.   A party intending to submit a subdivision application under this
Chapter may request a pre-application meeting with the Subdivision Development
Committee for the purpose of reviewing any element of the party's proposed
subdivision application (preliminary or final). The proposed application need
not be complete for purposes of this meeting and may-if the party desires-be
limited to a concept plan.
      1.   To request a pre-application meeting, the party must contact a City
staff member.
      2.   If a party requests a pre-application meeting, City staff shall
schedule the meeting within 15 business days after the request. The meeting
shall be scheduled at the earliest convenient opportunity, and, at the option
of the party requesting the meeting, shall occur within 45 business days after
scheduling.
      3.   The Subdivision Development Committee (or a member of the body that
makes up the Subdivision Development Committee) shall conduct the meeting,
provide feedback on materials as requested by the party, and shall provide or
have available on the City website the following at the time of the meeting:
         a.   Copies of applicable land use regulations;
         b.   A complete list of standards required for the project; and
         c.   Relevant application checklists. (Ord. 2024-06)

application under this Chapter, City staff shall provide written notice of the
proposed subdivision to the facility owner of any water conveyance facility
located, entirely or partially, within 100 feet of the subdivision plat.
      1.   To determine whether any water conveyance facility is located within
100 feet of a proposed subdivision, City staff shall review information:
         a.   From the facility owner under Utah Code §10-9a-211, using
mapping-grade global positioning satellite units or digitized data from the
most recent aerial photo available to the facility owner;
         b.   From the state engineer's inventory of canals; or
         c.   From a licensed surveyor who has consulted with a representative
of an existing water conveyance facility that services an area near the land
the application concerns.
   B.   To give water conveyance facilities time to provide feedback on
subdivision applications, the City shall not approve a preliminary or final
subdivision application under this Chapter sooner than 20 days after the
applicant submits a complete application. This waiting period does not apply to
revised applications the applicant may submit during the application review
process.
      1.   A water conveyance facility owner's failure to provide comments
about a subdivision application does not affect or impair the City's authority
to approve the subdivision application. (Ord. 2024-06)
16.14.090: REVIEW:
   A.   The respective Land Use Authorities or their designees shall review all
subdivision applications under this Chapter in accordance with the requirements
of this Section before approving or denying those applications.
   B.   For both preliminary and final applications, the review process begins
when an applicant submits a complete application.
      1.   The respective Land Use Authorities or their designees shall not
review an incomplete preliminary or final subdivision application, except to
determine whether the application is complete.
      2.   If the appropriate Land Use Authority or its designees determines
that a preliminary or final application is incomplete, it shall notify the
applicant of the incompleteness, highlighting any insufficiencies and
explaining that the application will not be reviewed until completed.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2937.png]
   C.   Preliminary Review: After the applicant submits a complete preliminary
application, the Land Use Authority or its designees shall review and provide
feedback to the applicant in up to three "review cycles."
      1.   A review cycle consists of the following phases:
         a.   Phase #1: The applicant submits a complete application (or, if
after the first cycle, submits a revised version of the complete application).
         b.   Phase #2: The Land Use Authority reviews the application in
detail and assesses whether the application conforms to City ordinances.
         c.   Phase #3: The Land Use Authority responds to the applicant,
citing any missing requirements or areas of noncompliance and providing a
detailed list of necessary revisions to the applicant, within 15 business days
after the applicant submitted the complete application. For any required
modification or addition to the application or request for more information,
the Land Use Authority shall be specific and include citations to ordinances,
standards, or specifications that require the modification and shall provide
the applicant with an index of all requested modifications or additions.
         d.   Phase #4: The applicant revises the application, addressing each
comment or requirement the Land Use Authority made. The applicant must submit
both revised plans and a written explanation in response to the Land Use
Authority's review comments, identifying and explaining the applicant's
revisions and reasons for declining to make revisions, if any. This written
explanation shall be comprehensive and specific, including citations to
applicable standards and ordinances and an index of requested revisions or
additions for each required correction. If the applicant fails to respond to a
comment made by the Land Use Authority in its review, the review cycle is not
complete and will remain open until the applicant addresses all comments.
      2.   Unless otherwise decided by the Planning Commission, the City
Engineer, with help from other City staff, shall receive, review, and respond
to preliminary applications (completing Step #2 and Step #3) during the first
two review cycles. The Planning Commission will then review the application and
either request further changes in the third review cycle or approve the
application.
         a.   The Planning Commission may review a preliminary application at
any time at its own request or the request of the City Engineer.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/1a202ccebc8094f77dc5affabff9497b45997243/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2939.png]
   D.   Final Review: Once the Planning Commission has approved an applicant's
preliminary application and once the applicant submits a complete final
application, the ALUA shall review and provide feedback to the applicant in up
to one review cycle. This review cycle functions as described in subsection C1,
except that the Land Use Authority shall have 20 business days to review and
respond to the applicant's final application (completing Step #2 and Step #3).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/1a202ccebc8094f77dc5affabff9497b45997243/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2941.png]
 
   E.   The City shall not require more than three review cycles for a
preliminary application and one for a final application under this Chapter. If
no further revisions are needed, the Planning Commission or ALUA, respectively,
may end a review period early and approve or deny the preliminary or final
application.
      1.   If the applicant makes a material change to a preliminary or final
application not requested by the City at any point in the review process, the
appropriate Land Use Authority may restart the review process, but only with
respect to the portion of the application that the material change
substantively affects.
      2.   If an applicant does not submit a revised application (beginning
Phase #1 of the next review cycle or triggering an approval decision) within 20
business days after the City requires a modification or correction (in Phase #3
of the past review cycle), the City shall have an additional 20 business days
to review and respond to the application (completing Phases #2 and #3 of the
next review cycle).
      3.   This provision notwithstanding, any subdivision application
affecting property within identified geological hazard areas is exempt from
review cycle restrictions and requirements.
   F.   After the third preliminary review cycle or the final review cycle is
complete, the Planning Commission or ALUA shall approve or deny the respective
preliminary or final application within 20 business days.
      1.   If the appropriate Land Use Authority has not approved or denied the
application within 20 business days after the allotted review cycles are
complete, the applicant may request a decision. After such a request, the City
shall, within 10 business days:
         a.   For a dispute arising from the subdivision improvement plans,
assemble an appeal panel in accordance with Utah Code §10-9a-508(5)(d) to
review and approve or deny the revised set of plans; or
         b.   For a dispute arising from the subdivision ordinance review,
advise the applicant, in writing, of the deficiency in the application and of
the right to appeal the determination to the designated Appeal Authority.
   G.   After the ALUA provides comments in the final review cycle, the City
shall not require further modifications or corrections to an application unless
those modifications or corrections are needed to protect public health and
safety or to enforce state or federal law or unless the review cycle reset due
to the applicant making a material change that the Planning Commission or the
ALUA did not request.
      1.   With the exception of modifications or corrections that are needed
to protect public health and safety, that are needed to enforce state or
federal law, or that arise from the review cycle being reset, the City waives
noncompliant subdivision-related requirements that the Planning Commission and
the ALUA do not identify during the review process.
      2.   The applicant shall make reasonable changes, unless prohibited
otherwise by a contract or deed, to the subdivision application to accommodate
water conveyance facilities to the extent required by Utah Code §73-1-15.5.
   H.   The Planning Commission may hold one or more public meetings during the
review period of a preliminary application under this Chapter for the purpose
of reviewing or approving such application.
      1.   All public meetings to review a preliminary subdivision application
must occur before the end of the City's review period in the third review
cycle. Scheduling issues shall not extend the review and approval deadlines in
this Chapter.
      2.   The applicant shall attend all public meetings held to discuss the
applicant's preliminary subdivision application. Unless waived by the Planning
Commission on a case-by-case basis, attendance at such meetings is a
requirement for submitting a complete final application.
   I.   Other chapters of this Title notwithstanding, the Planning Commission
and the ALUA, respectively, shall approve or deny preliminary and final
applications under this Chapter after reviewing the complete applications as
described in this Section. (Ord. 2024-06)
16.14.100: APPROVAL:
   A.   The Planning Commission and the ALUA, respectively, shall approve any
complete preliminary and final applications made under this Chapter that comply
with applicable City ordinances.
   B.   The Planning Commission and the ALUA shall issue all approvals in
writing. The ALUA shall certify the approved final plat, either by signing the
plat directly or by attaching a signed certification to the plat. (Ord. 2024-
06)
16.14.110: POST-APPROVAL ACTIONS:
   A.   The applicant shall record the approved final plat with the County
Recorder's Office within twelve months after the ALUA approves the final
application, provided that the applicant has completed any improvements or
posted any performance guarantee required by City ordinances or described in
the improvement plan the applicant submitted. The applicant shall not record
the approved final plat until such improvements are completed or guaranteed.
   B.   City staff shall submit to the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (so the
subdivision can be included in the 911 database), within 30 days after
approving a final application, either:
      1.   An electronic copy of the approved final plat; or
      2.   Preliminary geospatial data that depict any new streets and situs
addresses proposed for construction within the bounds of the approved final
plat.
   C.   City staff shall, if requested by the Utah Geospatial Resource Center:
      1.   Coordinate with the Utah Geospatial Resource Center to validate the
information the City submitted about the final plat; and
      2.   Assist the Utah Geospatial Resource Center in creating electronic
files that contain the information described in the final plat for inclusion in
the unified statewide 911 emergency service database. (Ord. 2024-06)

16.28.010: RELATION TO ADJOINING STREET SYSTEM:
   A.   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for
the continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper
protection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as such may be
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission for public requirements. The street
arrangement must be such as to cause no unnecessary hardship to owners of
adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for
convenient access to it. Half streets along the boundary of land proposed for
subdivision will not be permitted.
   B.   Minor streets shall approach the major or collector streets at an angle
of not less than eighty degrees (80°). (Ord. 2024-06: Ord. 89-003 § 7(A))

(130') and have a turnaround not less than one hundred ten feet (110') in
diameter, as measured from inside edge of the curb to inside edge of the curb.
If, due to the grade of the street, surface water drainage is into the
turnaround, then necessary catch basins and/or drains and drainage easements
shall be provided.
      2.   Where a street is designed to remain only temporarily as a dead end
street and a house has frontage on the street, an adequate temporary turning
area shall be provided at the dead end street thereof to remain and be
available for public use so long as the dead end condition exists.
      3.   Half cul-de-sacs and knuckles are not permitted on any street.

between the street and adjacent property, provided that an agreement approved
by the City Attorney has been made by the subdivider, contracting to deed to
the owners of the contiguous property, the one foot (1') or larger protection
strip for consideration named in the agreement. Such consideration to be not
more than the fair cost of land in the protection strip, the street
improvements properly chargeable to the contiguous property, plus the value of
one-half (1/2) the land in the street at the time of agreement, together with
interest at a fair rate from time of agreement until time of subdivision of
such contiguous property. One copy of the agreement shall be submitted to the
City Attorney and one to the Planning Commission prior to approval of the final
plat.
   I.   Street Access: Developments, including proposed developments done in
multiple phases, where the total number of dwelling units in the entire
development exceeds thirty (30), shall require two (2) separate City approved
access streets. Where two (2) access streets are required, they shall be placed
a distance apart not less than one-half (1/2) of the length of the maximum
overall diagonal dimension of the property, measured in a straight line between
accesses.
   J.   Alternative Access: If the required distance between the two (2) access
streets required by this chapter cannot be achieved because of the
development's configuration and dimensions, the location of connecting roads,
topography, waterways, nonnegotiable grades or other similar conditions which
are not due solely to the design of the development, then the developer may
submit to the Planning Commission for its consideration access streets which
have an alternate distance apart than that required by this paragraph. Such a
submission must fully describe the conditions which the developer believes
would not permit the distance between access roads required by this chapter and
include the developer's recommendation for alternate locations of the required
access streets. (Ord. 2024-06: Ord. 2017-12: Ord. 2014-03: Ord. 2013-04: Ord.

angles, or radial to the street lines.
   F.   Remnants To Be Absorbed: All remnants of lots below minimum size left
over after subdividing a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather
than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   G.   Single Or Joint Ownership Only: Where the land covered by a subdivision
includes two (2) or more parcels in separate ownership and the lot arrangement
is such that a property ownership line divides one or more lots, the land in
each lot so divided shall be transferred by deed to either single or joint
ownership before approval of the final plan, and such transfer certified to the
Planning Commission by the County Recorder. (Ord. 2024-06: Ord. 89-003 § 7(D))

addresses, must be included in the application. The city will notify these
property owners of the proposed rezone.

change for that portion of the property which is within the Farr West City to a
zone which is identical to, or most similar to, the municipal or county zone
governing that portion of the property within the adjacent county or
municipality. Such a zoning change request may be granted without condition if:
      1.   The entire property is owned by the same owner or owners;
      2.   The use of the property was established before the date of this
amendment and was ongoing up to the time of the zoning change request,
      3.   The use of the property is not being changed; and
      4.   The use of property is in compliance with the zoning regulations of
the neighboring county or municipality governing the portion of the property

17.16.010: APPEAL AUTHORITY POWERS AND DUTIES:
With regards to the zoning decisions, the appeal authority shall have the
following powers:
   A.   Appeals: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the
appellant that there is error in any order, decision or refusal made by
administrative official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of the
zoning ordinance;
   B.   Special Exceptions; Interpretation: To hear and decide, in accordance
with the provisions of any such ordinance, requests for special exceptions or
for interpretation of the map or for decisions on other special questions on
which such appeal authority is authorized by any such ordinance to hear;
   C.   Variances: Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the
regulation, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any regulation enacted would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardships upon,
the owner of such property, to authorize, on an appeal relating to said
property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardships, provided such relief may be granted without
substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning
ordinance of the city. Before any variance may be authorized, however, it shall
be shown that:
      1.   The variance will not substantially affect the comprehensive plan of
zoning in the city and that adherence to the strict letter of this title will
cause difficulties and hardships, the imposition of which upon the petitioner
is not necessary in order to carry out the general purpose of the plan,
      2.   Special circumstances attached to the property covered by the
application which do not generally apply to the other property in the same
zone,
      3.   Because of the special circumstances, property covered by
application is deprived of privilege possessed by other properties in the same
zone; and that the granting of the variance in the same zone is essential to
the enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in
the same zone;
   D.   Nonconformities In Buildings Or Structures: To permit the enlargement
of, addition to, or relocation of a building or structure, nonconforming as to
use regulations, as follows:
      1.   For a nonconforming use located in a residential zone, the
enlargement, addition or relocation shall either:
         a.   Comply with all the height, yard and area requirements for a
single-family dwelling in the zone in which the nonconforming building is
located, or
         b.   The proposed enlargement, addition or relocation will either:
            (1)   Improve the area by increasing the off street parking, or
            (2)   Improve the general appearance, convenience or safety of the
area.
      2.   For a nonconforming use located in any zone other than a residential
zone, the enlargement, addition or relocation shall comply with all height,
yard and area requirements for a main building, other than dwellings, in the
zone in which it is located.
      3.   Before granting a permit for any enlargement, addition, or
relocation as provided above, the appeal authority shall find that the proposed
changes will not hinder or obstruct the attainment of the objectives listed in
section
17.04.020 of this title more than does the existing nonconforming use;
   E.   Nonconformities In Yard, Height And Area: The appeal authority may
allow those enlargements of, additions to, or relocation of buildings and
structures, nonconforming as to yard, height or area regulations in those cases
where an undue hardship will result to the owner of the land involved unless
granted and the attainment of the objectives hindered or obstructed, and
provided the proposed enlargement, addition to or relocation will either:
      1.   Improve the area by increasing needed off street parking, or
      2.   Improve the general appearance, convenience or safety of the area;
   F.   Decide Boundaries: Where a zone boundary line divides a lot in single
ownership at the time of the establishment of said boundary, the appeal
authority may permit a use authorized on either portion of such lot to extend
to the entire lot, provided such permission shall not authorize the use to
extend more than thirty five feet (35') beyond the district boundary line or
extend to an area greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet beyond the
said boundary line;
   G.   Changes In Use: Permit a nonconforming use to be changed to another use
allowed in the same or a more restrictive zone than the one in which the
nonconforming use would be allowed; provided, that the appeal authority finds
in its public hearing that such change will not hinder or obstruct the
attainment of the objectives listed in section
17.04.020 of this title more than does the existing nonconforming use. (Ord.
13-05)
17.16.020: DECISION ON APPEAL:

administration or enforcement of the provisions of this title. Appeals to the
appeal authority may be taken by any officer, department, council, board or
commission of the city affected by the grant or refusal of a building permit or

unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the appeal
authority after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her that
by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by restraining order which may be granted by the
appeal authority or by the district court on application and notice and on due
cause shown. (Ord. 13-05)
17.16.050: NOTICE OF HEARING; RIGHT OF APPEARANCE:

provisions of this chapter, alterations in accordance with the variance must be

becomes null and void. The time limit of the variance may be extended an
additional six (6) months by the appeal authority, and then only if the
petitioner shows adequate cause to the appeal authority that circumstances
necessitate a time extension. (Ord. 13-05)
17.16.070: FILING FEE:
Upon filing of any appeal or application to the appeal authority, the appellant
or applicant shall pay to the city a fee as prescribed in the fee schedule in

17.32.020: Planned Development Designation
17.32.030: Standards And Requirements
17.32.040: Guarantees And Covenants
17.32.050: Review Procedure
17.32.010: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of the Planned Development Overlay Zone is to encourage thoughtful
and efficient utilization of land in residential areas and by providing greater
flexibility in the location and density of buildings. It also allows the
consolidation of open spaces, the clustering of dwelling units, and the
efficient use of those public amenities required in connection with new
residential development. These provisions are intended to create more
attractive and more desirable environments within residential areas of the City
and to accommodate moderate income housing initiatives in accordance with Utah
state housing requirements and Farr West City general plan chapter eight.
(Ord. 2025-03)
17.32.020: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGNATION:
The PD Overlay Zone is permitted to be used in areas of three acres or more
located in residential zones. All PD overlays will require the applicant to
enter into a development agreement with the City. The PD overlay provisions,
along with the development agreement, shall supersede the site development
standards of the zone to which it is applied. Any PD overlay project shall be
developed in strict conformance with this chapter and the final development
agreement as recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City
Council. The PD overlay designation shall encompass planned residential
developments of single-family housing and townhomes. Permitted uses in the PD
overlay shall be limited to those uses permitted in the underlying zone to
which the PD overlayapplies. The Planned Development Overlay Zone designation
(PD) shall become a suffix to the residential zone with which it is combined
and shall be shown on the official zoning map.
(Ord. 2025-03)
17.32.030: STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
A planned development established under the provisions of this chapter shall
conform to the following standards:

allowable dwelling units and shall contain a maximum of four units per
townhome. In computing the total allowable dwelling units, any fraction of one
unit shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
   B.   Density Bonus: The developer may request higher density than that which
is defined in this chapter. The Planning Commission must agree, however, that
any increase in density will be compensated for by increased public open space
and/or amenities and improved design which, by the commission's discretion, are
deemed proportional to the requested density increase. The increased density
shall be incorporated into the final development agreement as recommended by
the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council.
   C.   Building Locations: With the following exceptions, dwellings and
permitted structures may be located as approved in the final development plans.
Locations and arrangements of buildings on the lot should be accomplished in a
manner that will best utilize the lot area and create an attractive living
environment. The following exceptions shall be considered minimum requirements
as applicable:

the planned development and shall be equal to that required by the zone on the
property immediately adjacent thereto.
      3.   In those instances where a proposed planned development will front
upon one or more existing streets, the setback from the street shall be equal
to that required by the most restrictive zone of the property immediately
adjacent along the same street frontage.
   D.   Open Space: Not less than twenty percent (20%) of the total acreage of
the planned development shall be retained as permanent open space (parks,
playgrounds, trails, etc. See requirements below). Vehicular streets or roads,
parking, driveways and other required setbacks are not allowed to be included
in the computations for open space.

be protected against building development by conveying to the City as part of
the condition of project approval, an open space easement over such open areas,
restricting the area against any future building or use, except as approved on
the final development plan. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the open space
must also remain accessible to the public.
      4.   The care and maintenance of the area within such open space
reservation shall be ensured by the developer by establishing a private
association or corporation responsible for such maintenance which shall levy
the cost thereof as an assessment on the property owners within the planned
development. Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservations
shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City and made a part of the
conditions of the final plan approval.
      5.   Maintenance of open space reservations shall be managed by a person,
partnership or corporate entity in which there is adequate expertise and
experience in property management to ensure that said maintenance is
accomplished efficiently at a high-quality standard.

control or other mechanism that automatically controls the sign's brightness
and display period.

motion, dwell time, brightness, rotation time and all other curfew requirements
as outlined below for outdoor advertising structures. (Ord. 16-01)
17.56.100: OUTDOOR ADVERTISING STRUCTURES:
No outdoor advertising structures, as that term is defined in Utah Code
Annotated section 72-7-502 shall be permitted in Farr West City which were not
permitted as of September 1, 2015. Relocation of outdoor advertising structure
within Farr West City shall not be permitted, except when such relocation is
permitted or required in accordance with Utah Code Annotated sections 72-7-510,
513 and 516. Every outdoor advertising structure shall be maintained in a safe,
presentable and good condition, suitable for its intended use.
Existing outdoor advertising may be converted to digital outdoor advertising
but may not exceed the height and square footage of the present structure.
Video animation shall be prohibited including text, image or graphic scrolling
and animated advertisement transitions. Any structural changes, including
conversion of any sign faces, require a building permit.
Limitations:
   A.   Digital advertisements shall have a minimum dwell time of eight (8)
seconds and a maximum rotation time of one-fourth (0.25) second.

occupied dwelling and within a one hundred twenty degree (120°) radius area
measured from the center point of the digital sign face or signs within one
hundred fifty feet (150') of a legally occupied dwelling and within a thirty
degree (30°) radius area measured from the point of the digital sign face and
beginning at the one hundred twenty degree (120°) line, shall adhere to the
curfew requirements between ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. and six o'clock (6:00)
A.M. daily.

three-tenths (0.3) foot-candle when measured by a foot- candle meter,
perpendicular to the digital face at a distance of three hundred feet (300').
   E.   All digital signs shall be equipped with an automatic dimmer control or
other mechanism that automatically controls the sign's brightness and display
period.
   F.   Prior to the approval of any permit to operate digital outdoor
advertising, the applicant shall certify that the sign has been tested and
complies with the motion, dwell time, brightness, rotation time and all other
requirements within this regulation.

up to two hundred ninety nine dollars ($299.00) for each occurrence. If such

   A.   Purpose: Farr West property owners are not required to install curb
signs, but are encouraged to do so for the quick identification of a home or
business by fire/EMS, law enforcement, or other city personnel in the event of
an emergency. Curb signs are for the sole purpose of assisting in identifying
the location of specific homes or businesses. Only one curb sign displaying the
building number is allowed per residence, lot, or business. Street names or
additional street numbers are not allowed. Advertisements, logos, or any other
commercial identifiers are prohibited.
   B.   Materials: All house or business numbers shall be painted using a
nonreflective matte black paint on a solidly filled reflective white paint
background. Numbers are to be in a block type font only. The white background
shall be rectangular in shape with a length no longer than sixteen inches (16")
and a height of no more than six inches (6"). Numbers shall be no more than
five inches (5") in height with a font width of three- fourths (3/4) to one
inch (1"). The numbers shall be spaced one inch (1") apart. The house or
business number, in its entirety, shall be centered on the background allowing
for a minimum of a one-half inch (1/2") contiguous border.
   C.   Location Of The Sign: The sign shall be applied between the approach
(driveway, etc.) and the farthest front edge of the property and centered at a
distance of three feet (3') from the nearest edge of the approach. If the
property has two (2) approaches, either approach may be used as the start of
measuring. If the property is a corner lot, the sign shall be painted on the
curb of the street of which the property is assigned regardless of whether or
not an approach exists. If an approach does not exist, the sign shall be
centered between the corner and the property line. If the approach is the entry
point of a flag lot or if the approach is centered within the lot, the sign may
be painted on either side of the approach. If the distance from a flag lot
approach is less than three feet (3') from the property line, the sign
placement shall be centered midway between the approach and the property line.
   D.   Curb Painting As A Business: Any person who operates or advertises a
curb sign painting business shall obtain a Farr West business license prior to
soliciting or conducting any such work on any property in the city. (Ord. 16-
