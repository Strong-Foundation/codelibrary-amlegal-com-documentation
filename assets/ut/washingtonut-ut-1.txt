SECTION 8-7-6: POST-CONSTRUCTION
 
A.   Applicability
1.   In General. This Ordinance shall apply to any application for a building
permit, subdivision approval, site plan approval or other zoning, planning or
land use approval that is filed on or after the date of adoption for any New
Development or Redevelopment within tWashington City that Discharges Stormwater
to the Washington City’s MS4 and to associated Stormwater Management
Facilities.
 
2.   Exception. This Ordinance does not apply to New Development or
Redevelopment on a lot, tract or parcel where that lot, tract or parcel is part
of a subdivision that is approved under this Ordinance; said lot, tract or
parcel shall not require separate review under this Ordinance, but shall comply
with the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan requirements for that
approved subdivision.
 
B.   Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan Approval
1.   General Requirement. Except as provided in Section 5.B. above, no
Applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, site plan approval or
other land use approval for New Development or Redevelopment to which this
Ordinance is applicable shall receive such permit or approval for that New
Development or Redevelopment unless the Municipal Permitting Authority for that
New Development or Redevelopment also determines that the Applicant’s Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan for that New Development or
Redevelopment meets the requirements of this Ordinance and the Maintenance
Agreement has been recorded in the office of the Washington County Recorder.
 
C.   Standards
1.   Stormwater Management Plan Required. The Applicant shall make adequate
provision for the management of the quantity and quality of all stormwater
generated by the New Development or Redevelopment through a Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Plan. This Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan
shall be designed by a Professional Engineer to meet the standards contained in
the Grading Manual and must include evaluation of Low Impact Development as
well as fully comply with all practices described in the Storm Water General
Permit.
 
2.   Stormwater Maintenance Agreement Required. Where the Applicant proposes to
retain ownership of the Stormwater Management Facilities shown in its Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan, the Applicant shall submit to
Washington City documentation, approved as to legal sufficiency by the City’s
attorney that the Applicant, its successors, heirs and assigns shall have the
legal obligation and the resources available to operate, repair, maintain and
replace the stormwater management facilities. Applications for New Development
or Redevelopment requiring Stormwater Management Facilities shall enter into a
Maintenance Agreement with Washington City.
 
3.   Location of Facilities. The Applicant may meet the quantity and quality
standards above either on-site or off-site, but where off-site facilities are
used, the Applicant must submit to the Washington City documentation, approved
as to legal sufficiency by the City’s attorney, that the Applicant has a
sufficient property interest in the property where the off-site facilities are
located -- by easement, covenant or other appropriate legal instrument -- to
ensure that the facilities will be able to provide post-construction stormwater
management for the New Development or Redevelopment and that the property will
not be altered in a way that interferes with the off-site facilities.
 
4.   Easements and Dedications. Whenever elements of the Stormwater Management
Facilities are not within the right-of-way of a public street and the
facilities will not be offered to Washington City for acceptance as public
facilities, the Municipal Permitting Authority may require that perpetual
easements conforming substantially with the lines of existing natural drainage,
and in a form acceptable to the City’s attorney, shall be provided to
Washington Cityallowing access for maintenance, repair, replacement and
improvement of the Stormwater Management Facilities. When an offer of
dedication is required by the Municipal Permitting Authority, the Applicant
shall be responsible for the maintenance of these Stormwater Management
Facilities under this Ordinance until such time (if ever) as they are accepted
by Washington City.
 
5.   Standards to Minimize Impacts on Water Quality: New development and
redevelopment projects must have requirements or standards to ensure that any
stormwater controls or management practices will prevent or minimize impacts to
water quality.
 
6.   Standards to Minimize Development In Susceptible Areas: New development
and redevelopment projects include nonstructural BMPs such as requirements and
standards to minimize development in areas susceptible to erosion and sediment
loss; to minimize the disturbance of native soils and vegetation; to preserve
areas in Washington City that provide important water quality benefits; to
implement measures for flood control; and to protect the integrity of natural
resources and sensitive areas.
 
7.   Projects Greater than or Equal to One (1) Acre: Newly developed and
redeveloped projects that disturb greater than or equal to one (1) acre,
including projects less than one (1) acre that are of a larger common plan of
development or sale, are required to submit a low impact development (LID)
approach to be evaluated by Washington City. An LID approach promotes the
implementation of BMPs that allow stormwater to infiltrate, evapotranspire or
harvest and use stormwater on site to reduce runoff from the site and protect
water quality. Guidance for implementing LID can be found in state of Utah
DWQ’s LID controls which are appropriate for use in the state of Utah and can
be found in “A Guide to Low Impact Development within Utah” (the Guide),
available on DWQ’s website or “Green Infrastructure and Low Impact Development
Application Guidance for Washington County, Utah,” available from Washington
City.
 
8.   Specific Criteria: Newly developed and redeveloped projects must meet
specific criteria which require that best management practices (BMPs) are
designed to manage rainfall on site, and prevent the off-site discharge of the
precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to the eightieth
(80th) percentile rainfall event or a predevelopment hydrologic condition,
whichever is less. This objective must be accomplished by the use of practices
that are designed, constructed, and maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire
and/or harvest and reuse rainwater, and must be incorporated into the
permittee’s development plans and long-term stormwater management plan which
includes the LID approach. If meeting the eightieth (80th) percentile standard
is infeasible an alternative design approach may be used; provided, that the
permittee documents that infiltration, evapotranspiration, and rainwater
harvesting have been used to the maximum extent feasible and that full
employment of these controls is infeasible due to constraints. For guidance
including alternative design approaches, see “A Guide to Low Impact Development
within Utah” published by the DWQ, and “Green Infrastructure and Low Impact
Development Application Guidance for Washington County, Utah.”
 
9.   Redevelopment: Redevelopment projects that increase impervious surface by
greater than 10% must prevent the off-site discharge of the net increase in
stormwater volume associated with precipitation from all rainfall events that
are less than or equal to the 80th percentile rainfall event.
 
10.   Stabilization Requirements: Any area that has been disturbed by grading
activity shall be stabilized according to a schedule provided by the contractor
or the owner/operator and approved by Washington City. A plan must be submitted
with the final design describing the vegetative or other stabilization and
management techniques to be used at a site. This plan will explain not only how
the site will be stabilized, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of
vegetation or other stabilization at the site, and what practices will be
employed to ensure that adequate cover is preserved. A long-term stormwater
management plan and a post-construction stormwater agreement are required prior
to the issuance of a grading permit.
 
11.   Engineering and Administrative Fees. At the time of application, the
Applicant shall pay to Washington City a fee as reflected on the Washington
City Master Fee Schedule for the review of the proposal unless it is determined
by the Public Works Department that a third party review of the proposal is
necessary. If it is determined that a third party review is necessary an
estimate will be provided to the owner for payment prior to review by a third
party.
 
In addition, any persons required to file an annual certification under Section
8-7-5(D) of this Ordinance shall pay, prior to the issuance of any temporary or
permanent certificate of compliance for the New Development or Redevelopment, a
fee as reflected on the Washington City Master Fee Schedule for review of the
annual certification.
 
12.   Notice of BMP Discharge to Washington City’s MS4. At the time of
application, the Applicant shall notify the Municipal Permitting Authority if
its Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan includes any BMP(s) that will
discharge toWashington City’s MS4 and shall include in this notification a
listing of which BMP(s) will so discharge.
 
13.   As-Built Certification. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Compliance for a project requiring a Post-Construction Stormwater Management
Plan under this ordinance, the Applicant shall submit evidence in the form of a
letter or plan prepared and stamped by a Professional Engineer who either
prepared the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan and its associated
Facilities or supervised the Plan and Facilities construction and
implementation. The letter or plan shall certify that the Stormwater Management
Facilities have been installed in accordance with the approved Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan and that they will function as intended
by said Plan. This certification must specifically include any LID measures
incorporated into the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan and the as
constructed volume of each toward the 80 th percentile retention requirement.
Any LID features to be constructed at a later date (such as facilities on
individual building lots) shall be specifically approved by the City Council at
the time of preliminary plat. If the LID proposal is approved, the requirements
of such facility shall record as a deed restriction against the property and
have notes placed upon the final plat describing the specific requirements for
said features.
 
14.   Conflict with State Laws or Rules. In addition to any other applicable
requirements of this Ordinance and tWashington City’s land use ordinances, any
New Development or Redevelopment which also requires a stormwater management
permit from the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) shall
comply with the rules adopted by DEQ, as the same may be amended from time to
time, and the Applicant shall document such compliance to the Municipal
Permitting Authority. Where the standards or other provisions of such
stormwater rules conflict with municipal ordinances, the stricter (more
protective) standard shall apply.
 
D.   Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan Compliance
1.   General Requirements. Any Person owning, operating, leasing or having
control over Stormwater Management Facilities required by a Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Plan approved under this Ordinance, and the Facilities
are located in Washington City and Discharge Stormwater to Washington City’s

the violation. Within ten (10) days of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted to Washington City.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
b.   Consent Orders. Washington City is empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the
same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection 2C
and 2D of this section.
c.   Show Cause Hearing. Washington City may order any person who violates this
Ordinance or permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the person
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action
and the reasons for such action, and a request that the violator show cause why
this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by mail.
d.   Compliance Order. When Washington City finds that any person has violated
or continues to violate this Ordinance or a permit or order issued hereunder,
they may issue an order to the violator directing that, following a specific

SECTION 8-7-7: ILLICIT DISCHARGES
 
A.   Scope
1.   This section shall apply to all water generated on developed or
undeveloped land entering the city’s separate storm sewer system.
 
B.   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges:
1.   No person shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the municipal
separate storm sewer system any discharge that is not composed entirely of
stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any non-stormwater,
uncontaminated discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system is
prohibited except as described as follows:
a.   Water line flushing or other potable water sources,
b.   Landscape irrigation or lawn watering,
c.   Diverted stream flows,
d.   Rising groundwater,
e.   Groundwater infiltration to storm drains,
f.   Uncontaminated pumped groundwater,
g.   Foundation or footing drains,
h.   Crawl space pumps,
i.   Air conditioning condensation,
j.   Springs,
k.   Natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
l.   Swimming pools (if dechlorinated – typically less than one (1) ppm
chlorine),
m.   Firefighting activities, and
n.   Any other uncontaminated water source.
o.   Discharges specified in writing by Washington City as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
p.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge if Washington City has so specified
in writing.
q.   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted
under a UPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger
and administered under the authority of the State of Utah, Division of Water
Quality; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
 
C.   Prohibition of Illicit Connections
1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the separate municipal storm sewer system is prohibited.
2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
 
D.   Reduction Of Storm Water Pollutants By The Use Of Best Management
Practices: Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, will be required to implement, at the
person’s expense, the BMPs necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES/UPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
 
E.   WASTE DISPOSAL PROHIBITIONS. No person shall throw, deposit, leave,
maintain, keep or permit to be thrown, deposited, left, or maintained, in or
upon any public or private property, driveway, parking area, street, alley,
sidewalk, component of the storm drain system or water of the U.S., any refuse,
rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned object, articles and
accumulations so that same may contribute to pollution. Wastes deposited in
streets in proper waste receptacles or for the purposes of citywide cleanup, no
less than two days prior to said event, are exempted from this prohibition.
 
F.   Notification Of Spills:
1.   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release
of materials which are resulting in, or may result in, illicit discharges or
pollutants discharging into the city stormwater facilities, the person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of
such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials the person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, the person shall notify Washington City in person or by telephone no
later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall
be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to Washington City within
three (3) business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three (3) years.
 
G.   Enforcement Authority: Consistent with the most current state of Utah
Department of Environmental Quality, UPDES stormwater general permits which
include: general stormwater permit for construction activity connected with
single lot housing projects; general permit for stormwater discharges from
construction activities; general permit for discharges from small municipal
separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), and Utah Code Title 19, Environmental
Quality Code Chapter 5, Water Quality Act, Washington City may detect,
investigate, eliminate and enforce against non-stormwater discharges, including
illegal dumping, into the MS4. Washington City may apply escalating enforcement
procedures as necessary for the severity of violation and the recalcitrance of
the violator. Washington City may issue notices of violation, stop work orders,
citations, and impose civil penalties. Washington City may also perform
necessary maintenance or corrective actions it deems necessary at the expense
of the owner/operator.
 
Non-stormwater discharges to the MS4, including spills, illicit connections,
illegal dumping, and sanitary sewer overflows into the storm sewer system,
require ceasing the illicit discharge or otherwise eliminating the discharge or
removal of such discharges.
 
The city may complete periodic inspections to ensure that the owner’s/
operator’s chosen BMPs used to address the site's stormwater quality are
performing adequately. If BMPs are not performing adequately, the city will
have the owner/operator update the erosion and sediment control plan and the
stormwater pollution prevention plan. Washington City shall be given access to
inspect stormwater BMPs on private properties that discharge to the MS4.
 
H.   Access to Facilities.
1.   The Public Works Department shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
2.   Facility operators shall allow the Public Works Department ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
3.   The Public Works Department shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
4.   The Public Works Department has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Public Works Department and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Department access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this ordinance.
7.   If the Public Works Department has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
I.   Violations:
1.   Written Notice Of Violation: Whenever Washington City finds that any
permittee or any other person discharging non-stormwater has violated or is
violating this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, the city may
serve upon such person written notice of the violation. An explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted to Washington City.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the discharger of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
2.   Consent Orders: Washington City is empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. The order may also include an
order for civil penalties to be paid for the violations. Consent orders shall
have the same force and effect as orders issued pursuant to subsections I3 and
I4 of this section.
3.   Compliance Order: When the city finds that any person has violated or
continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, he may
issue an order to the violator directing that, following a specific time
period, adequate structures or devices be installed or procedures implemented
and properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might
be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
civil penalties for the violation(s), the construction of appropriate
structures, installation of devices, self-monitoring, and management practices.
4.   Cease And Desist Orders: When the city finds that any person has violated
or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder,
the city may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct
those persons in noncompliance to:
a.   Comply forthwith;
b.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and terminating the discharge; and
c.   Pay any civil penalties assessed for the violation(s).
5.   Conflicting Standards: Whenever there is a conflict between any standard
contained in this chapter and in the Washington City stormwater management
program adopted by Washington City, the strictest standard shall prevail.
6.   Section 8-7-9: Suspension of MS4 access
7.   Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations
a.   The Public Works Department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement
agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
8.   Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge
a.   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and hearing. A person commits
an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant
to this Section, without the prior approval of Washington City.

paragraph, for each and every such violation, shall be punishable by a fine not
greater than the fine set forth in Section 1-4-1(D)(1) for a Class B
Misdemeanor
4.   Other Remedies: The city may bring legal action to enjoin the continuing
violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at law or
equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.

cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil
or criminal, that one (1) or more of the remedies set forth herein has been

outlet.

vendor. If there are no bidders who qualify as a local vendor, the same
preference may then be extended to Washington County under the conditions

the bid may be awarded to a local vendor, if the local vendor's bid is within
five percent (5%) of the low nonpreferred bid, and if the local vendor agrees,
in writing, within seventy two (72) hours after notification that it is the
qualified preferred bidder, to meet the low bid. Such notice shall contain the
exact bid submitted by the nonpreferred bidder, and the purchasing agent shall
enter into no contract until seventy two (72) hours have elapsed after
notification to the local vendor. The principal place of business of a local
vendor may be elsewhere as long as a local branch meeting the above criteria is
present. The domicile of one or more partners, owners, associates, directors,
employees or agents shall not qualify for constituting a local vendor in the
absence of an actual local business outlet. (Ord. 2011-02, 2-9-2011)

service appointment for any reason, the franchisee will contact the customer

The Historic Preservation Commission shall have the following duties:
   A.   Survey And Inventory Community Historic Resources: The Historic
Preservation Commission shall conduct or cause to be conducted a survey of the

   B.   Review Proposed Nominations To National Register Of Historical Places:
The Historic Preservation Commission shall review and comment to the state

represented on the Commission, the Commission shall, with prior approval of the
City Council, seek expertise in that area before rendering its decision.
      1.   Public Hearing: Upon recommendation by the commission that property
be nominated for inclusion on the national register, or upon recommendation by
the planning commission that a site be designated as a landmark site pursuant
to this chapter, the city council shall hold a public hearing preceded by
giving sufficient written notice to the owners and occupants of the affected
property and neighbors within 300 feet at least 14 days before the meeting. The
notice shall designate whether the subject property is nominated for inclusion
on the national register or whether it is being proposed as a landmark site

allowed. On the other hand, where application for landmark site designation has
been submitted to the planning commission and before decision by the city
council, the commission may cause an additional waiting period to be imposed
prohibiting demolition, material alteration, remodeling or relocation until
there has been action of non-recommendation by the planning commission or
action by the city council.

for inclusion on the national register or designated as a landmark site
pursuant to this chapter shall permit such structure or landmark to fall into a
state of disrepair which may result in the deterioration of any exterior
appurtenance or architectural feature so as to produce or tend to produce, in
the judgment of the commission, a detrimental effect upon the life and
character of the landmark or structure in question, including, but not limited
to:

attorney and, upon conviction, subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1. Any person who filed with the commission and who refused to furnish,
upon demand by the commission, any information relating to such application or
request, or who willfully makes any false statement in such application or
request, shall be also liable for such misdemeanor or lesser offense. For the
purpose of this chapter, each day during which there exists any violation of

2-2-1: CREATION AND COMPOSITION OF APPEALS BOARD:
   A.   Appointment; Membership: There is hereby created an appeals board to be
known as the Washington City employee appeals board ("board"). The board shall
consist of five (5) members who shall be appointed as follows:
      1.   City Council Members: The mayor shall appoint two (2) members of the
city council to the board. The mayor shall appoint one alternate member of the
city council to serve on the board. Appointments by the mayor are subject to
confirmation by a majority of the city council.
      2.   City Employee Members: The city manager shall appoint three (3)
members who are either appointed officers or employees of the city (excluding
the city manager and city recorder). The city manager shall appoint at least
four (4) alternate members who are either appointed officers or employees of
the city to serve on the board. The alternates shall sit on the board in place
of the regular members in accordance with the numerical designation assigned to
them by the city manager. There shall be no more than one department head
sitting on the board during any hearing. Appointments by the city manager are
subject to confirmation by a majority of the city council.
   B.   Terms Of Office: Terms of office for all members of the board,
including alternates, shall be two (2) years. Nothing shall prevent any member
of the board from being appointed to successive terms of office. If any member
is unable to complete his or her term of office or is unwilling to serve, then
a new member shall be appointed as provided for herein to serve the remaining
term.
   C.   Vacancy; Emergency Appointments: In the event that there is a vacancy
on the board when an appeal has been filed, the city manager shall have
authority to appoint an interim board member or members to serve on the board
and hear the appeal. The appointment shall be for that specific appeal only
unless the interim board member is thereafter confirmed by the city council.
Any vacancy that the city manager fills on an interim basis must maintain the
balance between city council members and city employee members as specified in
subsections A1 and A2 of this section. For purposes of this section, a
"vacancy" may also occur when a conflict of interest prevents appointed board
members and alternates from serving on any particular appeal.
   D.   Secretary: The city recorder shall act as secretary to the board.
   E.   Administrative Law Judge; Board Attorney: The board shall have the
authority to retain an individual to act as the administrative law judge and
attorney and counselor to the board ("ALJ"). The ALJ must be an attorney duly
licensed to practice law in the state of Utah. The ALJ shall have the authority
to: 1) meet and confer with the board as its attorney; 2) conduct the public
hearing; 3) make rulings on any procedural or evidentiary matters that arise at
the public hearing; 4) assist the board in preparing findings and conclusions
to the extent deemed necessary; and 5) assist or otherwise prepare for the
board any procedural rules or regulations that the ALJ, with the approval of
the board, deems necessary to aid in the conduct of the public hearing. (Ord.
2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-2: RIGHT TO APPEAL:
If an employee to which Utah Code Annotated section 10-3-1105(1)(a) applies is
discharged, suspended for more than two (2) days without pay, or involuntarily
transferred from one position to another with less remuneration for any
disciplinary reason, the employee may appeal the final decision to discharge,
suspend without pay, or involuntary transfer to the board. There is no right of
appeal for any discharge or involuntary transfer that results from a layoff,
reorganization, or budgetary constraints. The right to appeal shall be subject
to the employee's compliance with and exhaustion of the informal grievance
process set forth and established in section
2-2-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-3: INFORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE:
   A.   City Manager: An employee who is subject to any disciplinary action
described in section
2-2-2 of this chapter and desires to appeal that action must request a meeting
with the city manager to review the matter within ten (10) business days
(excluding holidays and weekends) of the date disciplinary action is taken. The
city manager may consider the facts and conduct any investigation that the city
manager deems appropriate under the circumstances. The city manager will
respond to the employee within ten (10) business days (excluding holidays and
weekends) of the meeting with the employee. An employee may not bypass the
grievance procedure and the city manager is not disqualified from conducting a
grievance review if the city manager was involved in the decision on which the
grievance is based.
   B.   Referral To Appeals Board: If the employee is not satisfied with the
city manager's decision or the city manager does not respond to the employee
within ten (10) business days as set forth in subsection A of this section, the
employee may request that the matter be heard by the board. This request shall
be made pursuant to and in compliance with section
2-2-4 of this chapter.
   C.   Application Of Procedure: The grievance procedure outlined in this
chapter applies only to matters arising under Utah code sections 10-3-1105 and
10-3-1106. It does not apply to other processes, whether formal or informal,
which are labeled "grievances" in other city ordinances or the provisions of
any employee handbook or personnel policies and procedures distributed by the
city. (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-4: FILING THE APPEAL:
   A.   Each appeal to the board shall be taken by filing written notice of the
appeal with the city recorder within ten (10) calendar days after final
disposition of the grievance process. Upon the filing of an appeal, the city
recorder shall refer the matter to the board by providing the board with the
notice of appeal.
   B.   Upon receipt of the appeal from the city recorder, the board shall
forthwith commence its investigation, take and receive evidence, and fully hear
and determine the matter which relates to the reason for the discharge,
suspension, or involuntary transfer. To the extent prior disciplinary history
or conduct factored into the reason for the discharge, suspension, or
involuntary transfer, the board may take and hear that evidence. (Ord. 2014-24,
10-8-2014)
2-2-5: PROCEDURE FOR CONDUCTING HEARING:
   A.   Rights Of Employee: An employee who is the subject of the discharge,
suspension, or transfer may: 1) appear in person and be represented by counsel;
2) have a public hearing; 3) confront the witness whose testimony is to be
considered; and 4) examine the evidence to be considered by the board.
   B.   Rules Of Procedure And Evidence: Hearings shall be conducted with
appropriate formality and decorum, so that the due process rights of the
appellant are protected. The Utah rules of evidence and Utah rules of civil
procedure should serve as guidelines and may but need not be strictly followed
or applied. The board, however, may determine how much weight to give to such
evidence and may discount or reject evidence that it deems not credible or
which is otherwise inadmissible under the rules of evidence, even if received.
On stipulation of both the city and employee, the board may receive evidence
through proffer, and may determine how much weight to give proffered evidence.
   C.   Administrative Record: The city recorder shall be responsible for
keeping and assembling the record of the appeal. The record shall consist of
any documents considered by the board, any documents received into evidence at
the hearing, and any recording of the appeal that is: 1) taken by the city
recorder or 2) recorded by an officer as defined in rule 28 of the Utah rules
of civil procedure who is retained by the board to make a record of the
hearing. (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-6: STANDARD OF REVIEW AND BURDEN OF PROOF:
The board shall presume the action of the city that is the subject of the
appeal is valid and uphold such action unless it is shown and the board finds
that the action was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise illegal. For purposes
of this chapter, an action is "arbitrary and capricious" if it has no basis in
fact and is otherwise not supported by any established personnel policies and
procedures. An "illegal" action is one that violates state or federal law. The
burden of proof shall at all times remain with the employee taking the appeal
and the board shall at all times defer to the discretion exercised by the city
in its employment and disciplinary decisions. It shall take an affirmative vote
of three (3) board members to overturn the action which is the subject of the
appeal. (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-7: DECISION; TIME FRAME FOR DECISION:
Decisions of the board shall be by secret ballot and shall be certified to the
city recorder within fifteen (15) days from the hearing date. For good cause,
the board may extend the fifteen (15) day period to a maximum of sixty (60)
days, if the employee and the city both consent. If a majority of the board
finds in favor of the employee and overturns the disciplinary decision, the
employee shall receive the amounts specified in Utah code section 10-3-1106(5)
(b). (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)
2-2-8: REVIEW OF APPEALS BOARD DECISION:
If any party to the appeals board proceeding desires to appeal the final action
or order of the board, that party shall do so by filing a petition for review
with the Utah court of appeals in accordance with Utah Code Annotated section
10-3-1106(6). (Ord. 2014-24, 10-8-2014)

business operations and premises as provided hereunder for the purpose of
ascertaining such compliance with the laws and regulations of the city in areas
of health, fire prevention, safety and consumer protection, together with such
examination of his business books and records as may be necessary for
determining the payment of fees hereunder. Where the license assessor and
collector deems it necessary and advisable, he may require the applicant or
licensee to maintain casualty or liability insurance in an amount and of a
nature to be prescribed during all periods that the licensee engages in
business in the city in order to afford adequate protection to those who
patronize such business, and an applicant or licensee accepts such requirement
as a further condition of his right to do business in the city. (1989 Code § 9-

section
3-1A-2 of this article, those inspectors designated in said section shall
report all violations of this article or of other laws or ordinances to the
license assessor and collector and shall submit such other reports as the city
council shall order. Upon receipt of a report of the violation of this article
or of any other law or ordinance of the city, the license assessor and
collector shall issue to the affected person a provisional order to comply, in
writing, which shall be personally served upon the person and advise him of the
specific violation. In the event service cannot be obtained upon the person
doing business or his agent or employee, a copy of such notice shall be affixed
to some structure on the premises, and a copy shall be deposited in the United
States mail, addressed to the address contained on the license application. The
provisional order shall require compliance, or arrangements with the license
assessor and collector for such compliance, within five (5) days of service of
the order, unless the affected person requests a hearing.
   B.   Hearing: A hearing on the provisional order shall be requested in
writing and presented to the city council setting forth the provisional order,
the alleged noncompliance and the reason why the licensee believes that he is
either complying or should not have to comply. Such request for hearing must be
filed within ten (10) days after receipt by the licensee of personal service or
within fifteen (15) days after the mailing of notice by the license assessor
and collector. Filing shall be by delivery to the license assessor and
collector. The city council shall thereupon advise the licensee of a hearing
date, such date to be at least five (5) days after the filing of request for
hearing, and upon such hearing the licensee shall be afforded full opportunity
to present witnesses and evidence in support of his allegation that he either
complies or should not have to comply. The hearing shall be public.
   C.   Decision; Compliance Time Limit; Revocation: In the event the city
council shall concur with the licensee, the license assessor and collector
shall be directed to quash the provisional order. If the city council upholds
the provisional order, or if no hearing before the city council is requested
within the time allowed, the provisional order shall be considered final. Upon
failure of the licensee to comply with the provisional order within five (5)
days after service of the order, or five (5) days after ruling by the city
council in the event of a hearing, the license assessor and collector shall
have the right to declare the business license revoked because of the violation
referred to in the provisional order for the reason that the operation of the
business is so inimical to the public health, safety and the general welfare as
to constitute a nuisance. Upon revocation of a license, the licensee shall
summarily cease business and close the premises upon which the business was
operated.
   D.   Civil Suit: The city attorney shall institute civil suit at the request
of the license assessor and collector to enjoin the operation of any business
being operated without the license required hereunder, and he shall also
commence suit to collect the amount of any unpaid fee, the payment of which is
required hereunder, if it cannot be collected by other means. (1989 Code § 9-

city, and any person engaging in business without having a license from the
city so to do shall be liable to an action in the name of the city in any court
of competent jurisdiction for the amount of license by this article imposed on
such business. In the event of payment by the licensee which is insufficient
under the provisions of this article, he shall similarly be liable to an action
as provided herein. (1989 Code § 9-321)

retailer licenses issued within the city shall not exceed that number
determined by dividing the population of the city by one thousand (1,000).

square feet and the impact of the applicant upon the economy of the city is
determined to be beneficial.
      2.   On-Premises Beer Retailer Tavern: On and after July 1, 1994, the
city shall not issue any new on-premises beer retailer tavern licenses. The
city may only renew existing on-premises beer retailer tavern licenses, permit
a change of licensee at licensed premises existing as of July 1, 1994, and
allow existing on-premises beer retailer tavern licensees to move to new
locations if the license fees are paid and the new location meets the
requirements of this chapter and other provisions of this code and the
requirements of the Act. Any on-premises beer retailer tavern licensee or
renewal whose license is revoked for whatever reason shall not be entitled to
obtain a new on-premises beer retailer tavern license.
      3.   Bar Establishment: The total number of licenses issued within the
city shall not exceed that number determined by dividing the population of the

commercial or planned development zone that has been amended by the city
council allowing a bar establishment in that zone.

within the city shall not exceed that number determined by dividing the
population of the city by ten thousand (10,000).

City Council in the event that the licensed location does not require new
facility construction. A bar establishment must obtain its business license and
be legally operating within eighteen (18) months from the date the site plan
approval is granted by the City Council in the event that the licensed location
is a new-build or substantial remodel/retrofit location. If a license is issued

within the city shall not exceed that number determined by dividing the
population of the city by ten thousand (10,000).
   B.   State License No Effect: A license issued by the state for the sale of
alcoholic beverages shall not affect the need for a separate license from the
city. Holding one (1) type of license under this chapter shall have no effect
on the applicability of regulations or quotas governing other types.
   C.   Population Determination: Population for determining the number of
licenses shall be by the most recent U.S. decennial or special census or by any
other population determination made by the United States government or the
state. If the city council wishes to make more frequent determinations of
population than what may be available from the above sources, it may do so
based on such formula as it may reasonably consider to be accurate, and in such
event, it may abandon that determination upon issuance of a new census figure
by the United States or state if it believes the latter to be more accurate.

Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety,
well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to
provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political
or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City
has a substantial interest in protecting the well being, tranquility, personal
safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect
citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has
a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair
consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its
citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this article on the rights of
those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials
derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from
criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door to
door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those
affected by door to door canvassing and soliciting, as well as judicial
decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and
denied persons seeking to engage in door to door solicitation, the City adopts
this article to promote the City’s substantial interests in:
   A.   Respecting citizens’ decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
   B.   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
   C.   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
   D.   Permitting truthful and non misleading door-to-door solicitation
regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
The City finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this
article are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City interests
referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those
regulated. (Ord. 2022-64, 12-14-2022)

public park, public square, public building, residential district, property
zoned for residential use or residential lot within one thousand feet (1,000')

has been revoked.

5-3-3: NUISANCES DEFINED:
This section defines "nuisance" by providing five (5) general definitions of
what constitutes a nuisance (subsection A of this section), and then providing
specific examples of situations, conduct or activities that constitute
nuisances (subsection B of this section). The purpose of the general
definitions is to allow the city to classify an offending situation, conduct or
activity as a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct or activity may not
be listed as a nuisance in the specific examples. The first three (3) general
definitions are taken directly from state law. The purpose of listing the
specific examples is to identify some of the specific situations, conduct and
activities that the city intends to abate as nuisances.
   A.   General Definitions Of Nuisance: Any activity that meets any one or
more of the five (5) definitions set forth below shall constitute a "nuisance"

      1.   Utah Code Annotated Sections:
         a.   "Nuisance", as defined in Utah Code Annotated section 78-38-1:

comfortable enjoyment of life or property.
         b.   "Nuisance", as defined in Utah Code Annotated section 76-10-801:
Any item, thing, manner or condition whatsoever that it is dangerous to human
life or health or renders soil, air, water or food impure or unwholesome.
         c.   "Nuisance", as defined in Utah Code Annotated section 76-10-803:

            (3)   Unlawfully interferes with, obstructs, or tends to obstruct,
or renders dangerous for passage, any lake, stream, canal or basin, or any

            (4)   In any way renders three (3) or more persons insecure in life
or the use of property. An act which affects three (3) or more persons in any
of the ways specified in this subsection is still a "nuisance" regardless of
the extent to which the annoyance or damage inflicted on individuals is
unequal.
      2.   Nuisance: A condition in which:
         a.   Wrongfully annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,
health or safety of others; or

subsection B of this section.
   B.   Nuisances Enumerated: Every situation, conduct or activity listed below
constitutes a nuisance and may be abated pursuant to this chapter. The listed
examples are not exhaustive; a situation, conduct or activity not listed below,

subsection A of this section, shall also constitute a nuisance. The first six
(6) listed nuisances are also listed as nuisances pursuant to Utah Code

(Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-4: EXCEPTIONS:
No act which is done or maintained under the express authority of an
authoritative statute, ordinance or court ruling shall be declared a nuisance.
(Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-5: RESPONSIBILITY FOR NUISANCES:
The responsible person is responsible for abating nuisances pursuant to this
chapter. Any person, whether as owner, agent or occupant, who creates, aids in
creating, or contributes to a nuisance, or who supports, continues or retains a
nuisance, is responsible for the nuisance and is therefor a responsible person
pursuant to this chapter. Every successive owner or tenant of a property or
premises who fails to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such
property or premises caused by a former owner or tenant is responsible therefor
in the same manner as the one who first created it. (Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-6: ENFORCEMENT; ADMINISTRATION:
This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the police department. In
case of nuisances involving dangerous buildings or violations of codes
typically administered and enforced by the community development and public
works departments, this chapter may also be administered and enforced by the
community development and public works departments. (Ord. 2012-02, 2-8-2012)
5-3-7: FINDING OF NUISANCE:
If a public safety official finds that a nuisance exists, the public safety
official shall attempt to have the responsible person abate the nuisance.
Although the public safety official's first step in correcting or abating the
nuisance will always be to obtain voluntary compliance, the public safety
official may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies available pursuant to
this chapter, state law or common law in order to abate the nuisance. Nothing
in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the city from engaging in its
standard prosecution practices. Therefore, the city may prosecute violators of
city ordinances or state laws without first having to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, even though the activity or conduct prosecuted may
also constitute a nuisance under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be
interpreted to prevent the city from enforcing applicable city ordinances,
building codes or the abatement of dangerous buildings code without first
treating the offending conduct, situation or activity as a nuisance pursuant to
this chapter. (Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-8: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION:
This section applies whenever the public safety official determines that a
nuisance exists.
   A.   Contact: Before taking other steps to abate the nuisance, the public
safety official shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary correction
or abatement of the nuisance by:
      1.   Contacting the responsible person, where possible;
      2.   Explaining the nuisance;
      3.   Requesting the responsible person to abate the nuisance; and
      4.   Agreeing to terms with the responsible person to abate the nuisance:
         a.   Verbal Agreement: The responsible person and the official may
agree verbally as to what actions must be taken to abate the nuisance. Failure
to abide by the verbal agreement can result in further action being taken, as
outlined in this chapter.
         b.   Voluntary Correction Agreement: The responsible person and the
official may memorialize the terms of their agreement as set forth in this
section.
   B.   Voluntary Correction Agreement: If the public safety official and the
responsible person agree to terms for abating the nuisance, they may enter into
a voluntary correction agreement. The voluntary correction agreement is a
contract between the city and the responsible person in which the responsible
person agrees to abate the nuisance within a specified time and according to
specified conditions. The voluntary correction agreement shall include the
following terms:
      1.   The name and address of the responsible person;
      2.   The street address of the nuisance, or a description sufficient to
identify the building, structure, premises or land upon or within which the
nuisance is occurring;
      3.   A description of the nuisance;
      4.   The necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time by
which correction must be completed;
      5.   An agreement by the responsible person that the city may inspect the
premises as may be necessary to determine compliance with the voluntary
correction agreement;
      6.   An agreement by the responsible person, in which the city may abate
the nuisance and recover its costs and expenses to abate the nuisance, as well
as a monetary fine pursuant to this chapter from the responsible person, if
terms of the voluntary correction agreement are not met;
      7.   An agreement by the responsible person acknowledging that he/she
waives the right to appeal the public safety official's finding that a nuisance
exists and waives the right to appeal the specific corrective action required
in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      8.   An agreement by the responsible person that failure to comply with
the voluntary correction agreement may be grounds for criminal prosecution. The
public safety official may grant an extension of the time limit for correcting
or abating the nuisance if the responsible person has shown due diligence and/
or substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance, but unforeseen
circumstances render abatement under the original conditions unattainable. If
the responsible person complies with the terms of the voluntary correction
agreement, the city shall take no further action against the responsible person
related to the nuisance described in the voluntary correction agreement, unless
the nuisance recurs.
   C.   No Agreement: If the public safety official and the responsible person
cannot agree to terms for correcting or abating the nuisance, the public safety
official may still set a deadline and abate the nuisance using one or more of
the procedures set forth in this chapter, state law or common law. (Ord. 2006-
27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-9: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION:
   A.   Citation: When the public safety official determines that a nuisance
exists, and is unable to secure voluntary correction pursuant to section
5-3-8 of this chapter, the public safety official may issue a citation to the
responsible person each and every day the nuisance exists. The public safety
official may issue a citation, or seek other remedies without having attempted
to secure voluntary correction as provided in section
5-3-8 under the following circumstances:
      1.   When an emergency exists; or
      2.   When the public safety official is unable to locate or determine the
identity of the responsible person; or
      3.   The violation is of the nature that a voluntary abatement agreement
or administrative citation would not be effective or appropriate.
   B.   Service Of Citation: The public safety official shall serve the
citation upon the responsible person. If the responsible person cannot, after
due diligence, be personally served within Washington County, and if an address
for service cannot, after due diligence, be ascertained, or the responsible
person cannot be reached by the long form process, notice shall be served by
posting a copy of the citation conspicuously on the affected property or
structure. Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under
penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting the service, declaring the
time and date of service, the manner by which the service was made, and if by
posting, the facts showing that due diligence was used in attempting to serve
the person personally. (Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
5-3-10: OTHER REMEDIES:
The city may take one or more of the following actions against any responsible
person who fails to comply with the terms of a voluntary consent agreement, a
citation, or an order of the judge:
   A.   Abatement By City:
      1.   The city may abate a nuisance when:
         a.   The terms of a voluntary correction agreement have not been met;
or
         b.   The requirements of a citation have not been complied with, or,
if the citation is appealed to a judge and the terms of the citation are
amended by the judge, the terms of the judge's order have not been complied
with; or
         c.   The condition is subject to summary abatement as provided for in
subsection A2 of this section.
      2.   Whenever a nuisance is occurring which constitutes an immediate and
emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or to the environment,
the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of
such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the responsible
person as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
      3.   Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property
and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city
may seek, but is not required to seek, such judicial process as it deems
necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition.
      4.   During an abatement proceeding, any personal property constituting a
"nuisance", as defined by this chapter, may be confiscated as part of the
abatement process. Any property that has been confiscated by the city as part
of an abatement will be held pending the resolution of the nuisance. The owner
of the abated property may recover the property upon showing that the nuisance
has been corrected or that substantial efforts, as determined by the public
safety officials, have been made to correct the nuisance. The property owner
shall pay the cost of storage of the property. If, after ninety (90) days of
the property being confiscated, the property owner fails to claim the
confiscated property, after complying with the requirements of Utah Code
Annotated section 77-24a-5, the city may dispose of the property, to include
sale at auction, disposal, etc., and seek to collect the cost of storage from
the property owner and any other remedies as provided by law.
      5.   The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting or abating
the violation shall be billed to the responsible person and/or the owner,
lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupy the
property and shall become due and payable to the city within ten (10) days of
actual receipt of the bill (within 15 days of the mailing date if the bill is
mailed). The term "incidental expenses" includes, but is not limited to:
         a.   Personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney
fees and costs;
         b.   Costs incurred in documenting the violation;
         c.   Hauling, storage and disposal expenses;
         d.   Actual expenses and costs for the city in preparing notices,
specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and
inspecting the work; or
         e.   The costs of any required printing and mailing.
   B.   Monetary Fine:
      1.   The responsible person shall pay the city a monetary fine for each
day the nuisance continues past the designated completion date. The nuisance
shall be considered to continue until the public safety official approves the
responsible person's actions to correct or abate the nuisance. The amount of
the monetary fine shall be as follows:
One hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day during the period that the
nuisance remains uncorrected or unabated after the completion date.
      2.   The monetary fine shall be cumulative and may not be waived by the
public safety official. Payment of a monetary fine pursuant to this section
does not relieve the responsible person from the duty to abate the nuisance as
required by the voluntary consent agreement or the citation. The monetary fine
constitutes a personal obligation of the responsible person. Any monetary fine
assessed must be paid to the city.
      3.   The city attorney or his designee is authorized to take appropriate
action to negotiate the amount of the monetary fine, collect the monetary fine,
determine the time period in which the fine shall be paid and take any other
action necessary to resolve the fine. In determining the time period in which
to pay, the city attorney or his designee may take into consideration the
number of days between the required completion date and the actual completion
date, public safety official input, the responsible person's cooperation, etc.
      4.   The city may also seek to collect reasonable attorney fees and costs
incurred in collecting the monetary fine where allowed by law.
   C.   Civil Actions: Either the city or any private person directly affected
by a nuisance may bring a civil action to abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for
damages for causing or maintaining the nuisance (including the cost, if any, of
cleaning the subject property). The civil action may be brought pursuant to
this chapter or pursuant to state law.
   D.   Criminal Actions: Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal
citation from the public safety official or by long form information. (Ord.
2006-27A, 9-27-2006)
      1.   Any person who maintains or assists in maintaining a nuisance is
guilty of a class C misdemeanor, subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. No person shall be prosecuted under this subsection unless
the public safety official first attempted to obtain voluntary correction as
provided in section
5-3-8 of this chapter, except where the nuisance requires immediate emergency
abatement and/or the responsible party is uncooperative in facilitating said
abatement.
      2.   If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of city
code (other than this nuisance chapter) or state law, the responsible person
may be charged under the specific provision of city code or state law, even if
the public safety official did not first attempt to obtain voluntary correction
as provided in section of
5-3-8 of this chapter.
      3.   Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes or interferes with the
city or its agents, or with the responsible person, in the performance of
duties imposed by this ordinance, or a decision and order issued by the judge,
or a voluntary correction agreement, is guilty of a class B misdemeanor,
subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-2006; amd. 2007 Code)
   E.   Abatement By Eviction: Whenever there is reason to believe that a
nuisance under subsections 5-3-3B1 through B6 of this chapter is kept,
maintained or exists in the city, the city attorney or any citizen residing in
the city, or any person or entity doing business in the city, in his or their
own names, may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate
the nuisance and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the tenant of
the property harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified
in state law.
   F.   Lien For Costs: Any person failing to pay any fines or costs related to
nuisance abatement when due, the city may record a lien on the property or
premises for the full amount of the unpaid fines and costs.
   G.   Nonexclusive Remedies: The city may take any or all of the above
mentioned remedies (civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/or to punish any
person or entity creating, causing or allowing a nuisance to exist. The
abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the city or any person
to recover damages or penalties for its past existence. (Ord. 2006-27A, 9-27-
2006)
5-3-11: HABITUAL NUISANCE:
   A.   Penalty For Habitual Nuisance: Any property determined to be a habitual
nuisance shall be subject to a fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
day.
   B.   Notice Of Nuisance: A building or premises may not be declared a
habitual nuisance nor may the two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fine be
collected unless notice to the responsible person has been given. Notice that a
property may be declared a habitual nuisance shall be stated in a notice or
through some other documentation delivered to the responsible person. The
notice shall state that future responses to the property may result in the
property being declared a habitual nuisance, subject to a fine. (Ord. 2006-27A,
9-27-2006)
5-3-12: APPEALS:
   A.   Grounds: Any person receiving a voluntary abatement agreement or
citation may appeal to the justice court judge. Only the following issues may
be appealed to the justice court judge:
      1.   The person charged in the citation as the responsible person, is not
the "responsible person", as defined by this chapter.
      2.   The method required to abate the nuisance is inappropriate or is not
the most cost effective method of effectively correcting or abating the
nuisance.
      3.   The public safety official refused to approve a corrective action
that met the requirements of the administrative citation.
      4.   The responsible person claims that the requirements of this chapter
violates his/her constitutional rights.
   B.   Filing; Considerations:
      1.   The person desiring to appeal a voluntary abatement agreement or
citation must do so in writing at the city justice court within no less than
five (5) and no more than fifteen (15) days of being served with the citation
or within fifteen (15) days of the mailing date if the citation is mailed.
      2.   The justice court judge may consider:
         a.   Whether the appellant responded to the public safety official's
attempts to contact the appellant and cooperated with efforts to correct the
nuisance;
         b.   Whether the appellant has shown due diligence and/or substantial
progress in correcting the nuisance;
         c.   The financial ability of the appellant and the amount, if any,
that the appellant has benefited financially by maintaining the nuisance;
         d.   Any other relevant factors.
      3.   If the appellant appeals the public safety official's refusal to
approve appellant's corrective action, the judge may visit the site, review the
photographic evidence, or order new pictures be taken to determine if the
appellant complied with the requirements of the administrative citation.
   C.   Order: The court shall issue a written or verbal order to the appellant
and the city notifying them of the judge's decision. The order shall include
the judge's findings of fact and ultimate decision. If the judge modifies or
waives provisions of the citation, the order shall specify which portions are
modified and how they are modified. The court shall mail a copy of the order to
the appellant and the city within five (5) working days of the close of the
hearing.
   D.   Appeal To District Court: Either the city or the appellant may appeal
the judge's order by filing a petition for review of the order. The petition
must be filed in the fifth district court within thirty (30) calendar days from
the date the judge's order was mailed to the appellant. In the petition, the
plaintiff may only allege that the judge's order was arbitrary, capricious or
illegal. The justice court shall transmit to the reviewing court the record of
its proceedings, including any minutes, findings, orders and, if available, a
true and correct transcript of its proceedings. If, in the opinion of the
district court, there is a sufficient record to review the judge's order, the
court's review is limited to the record provided by the justice court. The
district court may not accept or consider any evidence outside of the justice
court's record unless the evidence was offered to the justice court and the
court determines that it was improperly excluded by the judge. If, in the
opinion of the district court, there is not a sufficient record to review the
judge's order, the court may call witnesses and take evidence. No petition or
appeal may be filed in district court unless the responsible person first
appeals to the justice court pursuant to the terms set forth in this chapter.

other plantings on adjacent property shall not inappropriately overhang or
encroach upon sidewalks, streets, public rights-of-way or other designated
pedestrian ways, nor obstruct the view of traffic signs or any street

   F.   Considerations on Removing or Replacing a Shade Tree. In determining
whether a tree may be removed and replaced, the Parks Director, or designee,
shall consider, among other things, the following:
      1.   Whether the tree(s) pose a potential for safety problems despite a
sound maintenance program;
      2.   Whether the roots from adjacent park strip trees are interfering
with sewer lines servicing the adjacent property to the extent that the
property owner requires frequent repair of said sewer lines;
      3.   Whether the tree is dead, dying or incurably diseased;
      4.   Whether the tree is diseased and weakened by age, storm, fire or
other injuries so as to pose a danger to persons, property, improvements or
other trees;
      5.   Whether the tree(s) is identified by the City as an undesirable
species;
      6.   Whether the tree poses a hardship to the adjacent property owner
such as, but not limited to, the cracking or raising of a garage floor or, in
the case of a handicapped person, special circumstances exist which cause the
location of the tree to become a hindrance for vehicle and handicapped access;
      7.   Whether removal is necessary for construction of a street widening
or other public improvement project, or necessary street or public improvement
repair work.
   G.   Exceptions. Shade Trees, Park Trees, or other plantings which are
required by the City Council or Planning Commission to be planted by a

6-4-7: OTHER PLANTINGS:
Considerations for Other Plantings. For plantings in planting strips and public
easement areas, a mixed variety of species that are classified as drought
tolerant and approved for water-efficient landscape use shall be used and
should not be varieties that will mature to a height not to exceed two feet
(2') in height and which will not interfere with the functioning of any curb,
gutter, sidewalk, water meter, fire hydrant, or other public facility, and will
not interfere with or impair the growth of any approved Shade Tree, and will
not constitute a public nuisance. (Ord. 2022-09, 3-9-2022)
6-4-8: SHADE TREES IN NEW DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Responsible Developers. Where right-of-way park strip improvements
require trees in accordance with an approved Development Plan/Agreement, the
Developer shall install all Shade Trees and conform in all respects to the

STANDARDIZED STREET ADDRESSING
SECTION:
6-7-1: Purpose
6-7-2: Street Name Approval
6-7-3: Street Naming
6-7-4: Assignment Of Street names And Numbers
6-7-5: Building Identification
6-7-6: Multiple Family Residential
6-7-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is established to provide a standard system for consistent and
logical numbering and naming of streets and properties to avoid the duplication
of street names within Washington City and Washington County. This chapter
shall establish standard procedures for street naming, address numbering, and
keeping addressing numbers clearly identifiable. (Ord. 2019-27, 12-11-2019)
6-7-2: STREET NAME APPROVAL:
   A.   Approval of Street Names, New Developments: All proposed public and
private street names and types must be submitted and approved by the community
development department and the public works department at the time the plats
are under review by Washington City.
   B.   Approval of Street Names, Existing Developments: When it is necessary
to change the name or type of an existing public or private street, the street
name and type or number and the corresponding intersection coordinates must be
approved by the community development department and the public works
department to eliminate confusion and duplication with other streets throughout
the county. When a city determines to change the name of a street, it should
schedule a public hearing to convey information about proposed name changes to
citizens who are affected, and to eliminate capricious actions. (Ord. 2019-27,
12-11-2019)
6-7-3: STREET NAMING:
   A.   Duplication: Proposed street names that duplicate existing street names
in the city or elsewhere in Washington County shall be avoided. Having a
different street type suffix does not make the name different, e.g. Washington
Street and Washington Ave.
   B.   Confusion: In accordance with the goal of minimizing confusion for
street names containing locational and other characteristics, the following
criteria shall apply:
      1.   Proposed street names that sound very similar to existing names or
street names that have unconventional spellings shall be avoided.
      2.   The four compass directions shall not be used as part of the street
name (e.g. Eastwood). This is to eliminate the occurrence of double
directionals in assigning the address (e.g. 1229 W. Eastwood Drive).
      3.   The standard street type designators shall not be used as part of
the street name (e.g. Springlane Road). This is to eliminate the occurrence of
double street type designators in the address.
      4.   Abbreviations of part or the entire street name shall not be
allowed.
   C.   Continuity: Proposed street name are encouraged to have the following
characteristics:
      1.   Historic significance.
      2.   Local color and sense of place.
      3.   Overall theme.
      4.   Compatibility with adjacent streets.
   D.   Street Name Length: The length of a street name shall not be more than
fifteen (15) characters including one space and two words, but not to include
the street type designator.
   E.   Street type designators: Proposed street names and street types should
be matched as follows:
      1.   Boulevard and Parkway - arterials and collectors with planted or
other physically separate medians.
      2.   Drive and Way - a meandering, curvilinear or diagonal street usually
longer than one thousand feet (1,000') and most always connect to other rights-
of-way).
      3.   Road - streets longer than one thousand feet (1,000').
      4.   Street and Avenue - straight directional streets.
      5.   Lane - short collector or minor streets which are usually less than
one thousand feet (1,000') in length and may not always connect other rights-
of-ways. May be used in names for private rights-of-way.
      6.   Circle, Court, Place, Cove - cul-de-sacs and permanent dead-end
streets usually less than one thousand feet (1,000') in length. May be used
effectively in planned unit developments, condominiums or other conditional use
developments where streets with short branching configurations are proposed.
      7.   Alley - a small or narrow street, especially one running between or
behind buildings permitting access from the street to backyards or garages.
(Ord. 2019-27, 12-11-2019)
6-7-4: ASSIGNMENT OF STREET NAMES AND NUMBERS:
A street shall not be assigned a name and a number. This is to avoid persons
using both interchangeably with their official situs address. When a street is
designated with a an alphabetic name, only its intersection with other streets
are assigned numbers as coordinates for the purpose of displaying them on
intersection signs.
   A.   Streets which shall be assigned alphabetic names:
      1.   Streets that change direction at oblique angles to the address grid
system axes.
      2.   Streets that are diagonal to the address grid system axes.
      3.   Circled or looped thorough-fares which return to themselves. If
frontage number to be assigned for addresses on buildings are all on the
outside of the loop, or all on the inside of the circle, the street may be
given a single name, otherwise, a break shall be made at a distinct point at
the back of the loop and multiple names assigned. This is to avoid duplicate
and parallel address ranges for the same street name.
      4.   Horseshoe shaped thoroughfares that are not in alignment with the
countywide grid system shall be assigned at least two names with the breaks
occurring at the most distinct bends on the street.
      5.   Private streets which are proposed within private developments such
as condominiums and planned unit developments shall be named.
   B.   Streets which shall be assigned numbers:
      1.   Major collector streets or collector streets which are in continuous
alignment with the address grid system axes shall be assigned street numbers.
      2.   Marginal access streets which parallel major collector streets and
collector streets in alignment with Countywide Grid System shall be assigned
numbers.
   C.   Street numbering: When calculating street numbers and intersection
coordinates, all numbers shall be measured to the centerline of the roadway and
shall end with the digit “0" or “5". Private numbering systems shall be
avoided.
   D.   Property numbering: The following standards shall be applied to the
numbering of properties in the city:
      1.   Juxtaposition: Building numbers should be comparable (but not
duplicated) on parallel streets and should be in consecutive order.
      2.   Even-odd: Building numbers should be assigned to opposite sides of
the street as determined under the city address grid system.
      3.   Compass direction: On streets that do not conform to the four
compass directions, building numbers should be assigned from the axis that most
nearly matches the principal direction of the thoroughfare.
      4.   Corner lots: Dual addresses on corner lots shall be avoided. A final
address will be assigned when a site plan showing building footprint is
submitted.
      5.   Buildings without public frontage: Buildings that are hidden behind
other buildings or do not have public frontage shall be numbered from the
centerline of the principal access or driveway. (Ord. 2019-27, 12-11-2019)
6-7-5: BUILDING IDENTIFICATION:
All buildings shall have approved address numbers, and shall be identified
using the following standards:
   A.   Background: Numbers shall be set on a background of a contrasting
color.
   B.   Size: Numbers shall be Arabic numeral or alphabetic letters. Numbers
shall be a minimum of four inches (4") high with a minimum stroke width of one-
half inch (.5")
   C.   Visibility: Numbers shall be placed in a position that is plainly
legible and visible from the street or road fronting the property. When a
building is some distance from a street or when view of the building is blocked
by trees or shrubs, numbers should be displayed on a sign attached to a fence,
gate, street mailbox, or lawn stake, in addition to being placed on the
building.
   D.   Corner lots: On corner lots, house numbers should face the street named
in the Address. (Ord. 2019-27, 12-11-2019)
6-7-6: MULTIPLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL:
Building Identification sequence will start on the right side of the “main”
approved addressed entrance and flow in a counterclockwise spiral direction
consecutively numbering each building from outward to the inward. Individual
unit identification numbers will begin with the first and most outward building
on the right side of the main approved entrance and flow in a counterclockwise
spiral direction consecutively numbering each unit.
   A.   When multiple buildings exist on one property, the following standards
will be upheld:
      1.   Letters are to be used on the buildings on the furthest pop out to
maximize visibility.
      2.   Letters on the building should be legible and placed in the front of
the building facing the parking lot/roadway. If there is more than one entrance
into the building(s) letters need to be placed on all entrances that are from
the parking lot.
      3.   When a complex has multiple units, letters should be consistently
placed on the buildings in the same location.
      4.   Letters should be in contrast with the background of the building
color.
      5.   Size of letters shall be fifteen inches (15") high for single story
buildings, twenty-one inches (21") high for two story buildings, and twenty-
seven inches (27")) high for three story and higher buildings. Letters should
be placed near the top of the building to avoid obstruction and maximize
visibility. Trees shall not be permitted to be planted below the attached
letters or in a way that could potentially obstruct the letters when fully
mature.
      6.   Letters shall be lighted for night-time visibility, whether by
independent letter lighting or by illumination from an alternative light
source.
      7.   Numbers are to be used on the units (internally) and should be
Arabic or alphabetical letters. (Ord. 2019-27, 12-11-2019; amd. Ord. 2021-22,

ARTICLE A. WATER SUPPLY/SHORTAGE AND DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLAN
SECTION:
7-1A-1: Plan Implementation
7-1A-2: Stage 1 Voluntary Restrictions On Nonessential Water Use
7-1A-3: Stage 2 Mandatory Restrictions On Nonessential Water Use
7-1A-4: Stage 3 Mandatory Restrictions On All Culinary Water Uses
7-1A-5: Stage 4 Water Rationing Plan For All Available Culinary Water Resources
7-1A-1: PLAN IMPLEMENTATION:
   A.   If a culinary water shortage or drought is expected, the city will
implement the following four (4) stage shortage of culinary water conservation
management plan. The implementation will be under the approval and direction of
the city council and city manager. The city staff (city department heads and
city manager) shall meet on a regular basis to discuss the drought conditions
and ensure all city departments are doing their part to comply, enforce and
encourage the outlined water conservation measures.
   B.   The following shortage or drought indicators will be used to decide
what stage or level should be implemented:
      1.   Stage 1:
         a.   If total culinary supply exceeds the total daily demand by only
two percent (2%) to three percent (3%) (i.e., water tanks cannot recover).
         b.   Water resources are reduced by two percent (2%) to three percent
(3%) due to equipment failure or lack of supply.
      2.   Stage 2:
         a.   Total culinary water resources are reduced by five percent (5%)
of peak capacity due to equipment failure or any other loss.
         b.   Total culinary demand exceeds supply by one percent (1%) to three
percent (3%) and stage 1 restrictions fail to meet goal.
      3.   Stage 3:
         a.   Total culinary water resources are reduced by ten percent (10%)
of peak capacity due to equipment failure or any other loss.
         b.   Total culinary water demand exceeds supply by five percent (5%)
and stage 2 restrictions fail to meet goal.
      4.   Stage 4:
         a.   Total culinary water resources are reduced by twenty five percent
(25%) of peak capacity due to equipment failure or any other loss.
         b.   Total culinary water demand exceeds supply by ten percent (10%)
and stage 3 restrictions fail to meet goal. (Ord. 2002-09, 4-24-2002)
7-1A-2: STAGE 1 VOLUNTARY RESTRICTIONS ON NONESSENTIAL WATER USE:
   A.   Goal: Estimated reduction goal is two percent (2%) to three percent
(3%) of peak use.
   B.   Procedure: Publish following news release in local newspaper, on the
web site and have radio stations announce the release.
News Release: The city of Washington is currently experiencing a shortage of
water supply. The supply cannot meet the current demands. The city adopted a
water shortage drought management plan on           . This plan involves four
(4) stages of water conservation/reduction. Due to the current conditions, the
city has decided to implement stage 1 of this plan. Stage 1 involves voluntary
restrictions on nonessential water use. This stage requests that all city,
county, state and federal organizations also follow these criteria. All
citizens are to conserve water wherever possible (inside and outside) and
suggest the following as guidelines for water conservation efforts:
Inside:
Fix dripping and leaking faucets and toilets. A leak in the toilet can waste
more than 100 gallons of water a day.
Don't let the water run while shaving. Filling the sink basin when shaving uses
1 gallon of water, letting the water run uses 5–10 gallons.
Don't flush the toilet unnecessarily. Water saving toilets use 1.6 gallons of
water, standard toilets use 5 to 7 gallons of water each time it's flushed.
Take shorter showers or fill bathtub only part way. Long showers waste 5 to 10
gallons of water every minute.
Don't run the water while brushing teeth. Turning the water off while brushing
your teeth can save 1.5 to 3.5 gallons of water.
Don't run the tap to make water hot or cold.
Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator so you don't have to run
the tap to get a cool drink of water.
Wash only full loads of dishes and laundry. A dishwasher uses approximately 25
gallons of water, a washing machine uses 30–35 gallons of water per cycle.
Install water saving plumbing fixtures. A water saving showerhead can save 1.5
gallons of water per minute.
Wash fruits and vegetables in a basin instead of under running water.
Outside:
Raise your lawn mower cutting height. Longer grass needs less water.
Don't plant any new grass or sod.
Don't fill swimming pools. If possible, cover the swimming pool. An uncovered
pool will lose 900–3,000 gallons of water a month to evaporation, a covered
pool loses 300–1,000 gallons a month.
Use mulch around shrubs and garden plants to save soil moisture.
Don't wash cars, or wash at a facility that recycles water. Washing the car
with the hose running uses 100–200 gallons of water.
Sweep sidewalks and steps rather than hosing.
Water lawns and gardens every 3 or 4 days, to 1 inch deep. Deep watering
encourages deep root growth. If the water is running off, turn off the
sprinkler, let the water soak in and start watering again. A typical sprinkler
system uses 20 gallons of water every minute.
Avoid watering on windy days or midday when the evaporation rate is the
highest. Water after 7:00 P.M.
Keep fire hydrants closed.
Adjust sprinklers to not spray road or sidewalk.
Repair leaks in hoses, pipes, faucets and connections.
If the implementation of these voluntary restrictions does not reduce the water
demand enough to meet the supply, the city will have to go to stage 2, 3 or 4
of the drought shortage of culinary water and drought management plan, which
involves mandatory restrictions.
   (Ord. 2002-09, 4-24-2002)
7-1A-3: STAGE 2 MANDATORY RESTRICTIONS ON NONESSENTIAL WATER USE:
   A.   Goal: Estimated reduction goal is five percent (5%) to ten percent
(10%) of peak use.

necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship. (Ord. 2002-09, 4-24-2002)
7-1A-5: STAGE 4 WATER RATIONING PLAN FOR ALL AVAILABLE CULINARY WATER
RESOURCES:
   A.   Goal: Estimated reduction goal is twenty five percent (25%) to sixty
percent (60%) of peak use.
   B.   Procedure: By the authority of the city manager and city council, the
following water rationing plan will be implemented, along with those of stages
1, 2 and 3:
      1.   General:
         a.   It is imperative that water customers within the city area
achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use in order to extend
existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that sufficient water is
available to preserve the public health and sanitation, and provide fire
protection service.
         b.   The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an
immediate twenty five percent (25%) reduction in water usage. Should drought
conditions continue, further reductions in usage may be required. If it is
necessary to implement further reductions, this plan will be modified to reduce
the levels more. It is the water department responsibility to continually
monitor on hand quantities to determine if amendments are required.
         c.   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage on the
part of each water customer. The success of this plan depends on the
cooperation of all water customers.
         d.   During this stage, the approval of any new building permits will
be delayed until the conservation restrictions are lifted.
      2.   Prohibited Nonessential Water Uses: The following water uses are
declared nonessential and will not be allowed within the city:
         a.   The watering of lawns.
         b.   The watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs
and other outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket, pail or handheld hose
equipped with an automatic shutoff nozzle between the hours of five o'clock (5:
00) P.M. and nine o'clock (9:00) A.M.
         c.   The watering of golf course fairways with culinary water.
         d.   The noncommercial washing of automobiles and trucks.
         e.   The washing of streets, driveways and sidewalks.
         f.   The serving of water in restaurants, clubs or eating places
unless specifically requested by the individual.
         g.   Ornamental water use, including, but not limited to, fountains,
artificial waterfalls and reflecting pools.
         h.   The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by
municipalities or any public or private individual or entity, except as deemed
necessary and approved in the interest of public health or safety by the city.
         i.   The use of fire hydrants by the fire department for testing fire
apparatus and for fire department drills, except as deemed necessary in the
interest of public safety and specifically approved by the city.
         j.   The use of fire hydrants by the street department, contractors
and all others, except as necessary for firefighting or protection purposes.
         k.   The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools, hot tubs,
etc.
      3.   Water Use Restrictions For All Water Customers: Customers include
residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, public and all other users,
with the exception of hospitals and healthcare facilities.
         a.   Water customers shall reduce their water usage by a minimum of
twenty five percent (25%) of use levels for the same quarter of the preceding
year.
         b.   It is the primary responsibility of each water customer to meet
its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner possible.
         c.   The city will establish a water allotment for each water
customer, based upon a required twenty five percent (25%) reduction of water
usage from the rate of water used by the customer in the same quarter of the
preceding year or the last recorded use level if no meter readings record the
rate of the customer's use in the same quarter of the preceding year.
         d.   Each water user shall provide access to the city personnel for
purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance with this plan. The city
shall make all reasonable efforts to contact customers to arrange for access.
      4.   Water Use Restrictions For Hospital And Healthcare Facilities:
         a.   Hospitals and healthcare facilities shall comply with all
restrictions imposed on water customers as may be applicable to each individual
institution, to the extent compliance will not endanger the health of the
patients or residents of the institution.
         b.   Each hospital and healthcare facility shall survey its water
usage patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation
measures as may be possible without endangering the health of patients or
residents to achieve a twenty five percent (25%) reduction in the institution's
water usage. The level of conservation arrived at will be recommended to the
city for billing and record. The established level that does not endanger the
health of the patients will be provided to the city for record.
   C.   Enforcement:
      1.   If any person or entity violates these restrictions, citations could
be issued or the city may elect to remove the water service from the property.
      2.   The utility billing department will monitor usage by using triggers
and computer alarms for notification.
   D.   Exemptions Or Variance:
      1.   If compliance with the nonessential use of water restrictions would
result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the water user may apply
for an exemption or variance. For purposes of this section, "extraordinary
hardship" means a permanent damage to property or other personal or economic
loss, which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by other
water users subject to the nonessential use of water restrictions.
      2.   A person or business entity believing he suffers an extraordinary
hardship and desiring to be wholly or partially exempt from the restrictions on
the nonessential use of water shall submit a written request with full
documentation supporting the need for the requested relief to the city.
      3.   The application shall contain information specifying:
         a.   The nature of the hardship claimed and reason for the requested
exemption or variance.
         b.   The efforts taken by the applicant to conserve water and extent
to which water use may be reduced by the applicant without extraordinary
hardship.
      4.   The city shall advise the applicant of its decision regarding the
application. An exemption or variance will be granted only to the extent
necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship. (Ord. 2002-09, 4-24-2002)

between the customer's in plant potable water system and nonpotable water
system, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping system.
   C.   Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection
control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water systems. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the following
meanings unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
APPROVED BACKFLOW ASSEMBLY: That assembly which is accepted by the Utah
department of health as meeting an applicable specification or as suitable for
the proposed use.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises other
than Washington City public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include
water from another public potable water supply or any natural sources such as a
well, spring, river, stream, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids".
These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which Washington City does not
have authority for sanitary control.
BACK PRESSURE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances
under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system
from any source other than the intended source.
BACK SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances
into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source
other than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the
potable water supply system.
BACKFLOW: The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphonage.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow. Specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained
within the international residential code, part VII, plumbing chapter 29, and
replacements thereof, and the cross connection control program for Utah. All
backflow prevention assemblies shall be approved by the Utah department of
health prior to installation. A listing of these approved backflow prevention
assemblies is available from the Utah department of health.
CONTAMINATION: An impairment of the quality of the potable water supply by
sewage, industrial fluids, water liquids, compounds or other materials to a
degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through
poisoning or through the spread of disease.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures
between two (2) otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur
into the potable water system. This shall include any temporary connections,
such as swing connections, removable sections, four (4) way plug valves,
spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding
multiport tubes.
CROSS CONNECTION, CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow
assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or
control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water
system. It shall also include isolation by the installation of an approved
backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a
portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross
connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point
of the cross connection.
CROSS CONNECTION, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system and a
nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly
installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection
commensurate with the degree of hazard. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-3: CONTAMINATION AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person having control in any degree over
any premises, or for any user of potable water supplied by the city, to permit
the existence or occurrence of: 1) back pressure or back siphonage causing
contamination; 2) backflow; or 3) contamination of the city potable water by an
auxiliary water supply. It shall be unlawful for any person having control in
any degree over any premises, or for any user of potable water supplied by the
city, to allow cross connection of the city potable water system with any
auxiliary water supply or other plumbing system which contains fluids not
originating within the city potable water system, unless such cross connection
is made with an approved backflow prevention assembly in compliance with this
chapter.
   B.   Each city water system customer shall be responsible for the protection
of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution
due to the backflow of contamination or pollutants through its water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the city council an approved backflow
prevention assembly is required (at the customer's water service connection or
within the customer's private water system) for the safety of the water system,
the water superintendent shall give notice in writing to said customer to
install such an approved backflow prevention assembly at a specific location on
his premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly at
the customer's own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of
the customer to install, have tested and maintain said assembly shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
requirements have been satisfactorily met. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-4: WATER SERVICE CONNECTION:
No water service connection to any premises, including an auxiliary water
supply connection, shall be installed or maintained by the water superintendent
unless the water supply is protected as required by state and local laws,
regulations, codes and this chapter. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-5: CROSS CONNECTION PREVENTION:

plumbing as it is installed, shall prevent cross connections from being
designed and built. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the
potential for a cross connection being made an integral part of the plumbing
system, the building inspector shall require such cross connections be either
eliminated or provided with an approved backflow prevention assembly in
accordance with the applicable codes.
   B.   The building inspector's authority to review and specify shall begin at
the point of service (the downstream side of the meter) and carry throughout
the entire length of the customer's water system. The building inspector shall
inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that
a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the
plans. When such a cross connection is discovered, it shall be mandatory that a
suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly be required by the plans and be
properly installed, in accordance with the applicable codes. (Ord. 90-17, 12-
13-1990)

      1.   Only certified backflow assembly technicians shall do the testing,
maintenance and/or repair of backflow prevention assemblies. The certified
technician shall tag each double check valve, pressure vacuum breaker, reduced
pressure backflow assembly and air gap, showing the serial number of the
assembly, date tested and by whom. The technician's license number shall also
be on this tag. Tests are made according to the regulations set forth by the
state department of health, bureau of drinking water/sanitation.
      2.   A technician making any test shall report the results of that test
to the customer, the water superintendent and the bureau of drinking water/
sanitation. If such a commercially tested assembly is in need of repair, a
licensed plumber shall make the actual repair.
      3.   Backflow prevention assemblies shall be inspected and tested at
least once per year at the expense of the owner, lessee or user of the
premises. In those instances where the water superintendent deems the hazard to
be great, he may require certified inspections and tests at a more frequent
interval. These inspections and tests shall be performed by a certified
backflow assembly technician.
      4.   All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10)
working days of initial installation.
      5.   No backflow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a
safety hazard or in violation of any plumbing, building or other codes.
   E.   Nonconforming Backflow Prevention Assemblies: All presently installed
backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this
chapter but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the
time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for
the inspection and maintenance requirements under this chapter, be excluded
from the requirements of these rules if the water superintendent determines
they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. The unit shall be
replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements
of this chapter whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present
location or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the water
superintendent finds that the maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard
to health. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-7: WATER SYSTEM INSPECTION:
The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to
the water superintendent to determine whether cross connections or other
structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this chapter, exist.
When such a condition becomes known, the water superintendent shall deny or
immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break
in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in
conformance with state and city statutes relating to plumbing, water supplies
and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-8: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water
superintendent if any violation of this chapter is suspected, or if a backflow
prevention assembly required by this chapter for control of backflow and cross
connections is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a
backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected
cross connection exists on the premises. Service shall not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected. (Ord. 90-17, 12-13-1990)
7-2-9: ENFORCEMENT:
The water superintendent is vested with the authority and responsibility for
the implementation of an effective cross connection control or cross connection
containment program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

7-5-1-1: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for Users of the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works for the St. George Regional Water Reclamation Facility and
enables Washington City (as well as the City of St. George) to comply with all
applicable State and Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United
States Code [U.S.C.] section 1251 et seq.), and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 403), and
the Utah Administrative Code R317-8-8. This chapter shall apply to all Users of
the Publicly Owned Treatment Works. This chapter authorizes the issuance of
individual wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires
User reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works that will interfere with its operation or contaminate the
resulting sludge;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works that will pass through the Publicly Owned Treatment Works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, the atmosphere, or otherwise be
incompatible with the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
   C.   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations found in 40 CFR Part 503;
   D.   To protect both Publicly Owned Treatment Works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment, and the
general public;
   E.   To promote reuse and recycling of wastewater and sludge from the
Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
   F.   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
and
   G.   To enable SGRWRF to comply with its Utah Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works is
subject. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)

7-5-5-5: INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER:
Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner and/or operator
only if the permittee gives at least 30 days advanced notice to the Manager,
and the Manager approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. Failure to
provide advance notice of such transfer to, and approval from, the Manager,
renders the wastewater discharge permit void on the date of facility transfer.
The notice to the Manager must include a written certification by the new owner
and/or operator which:
   A.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility’s operations and processes;
   B.    Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur;
   C.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit; and
   D.   Acknowledges the conditions of the permit will not change. (Ord. 2018-
27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-5-6: INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION
   A.   The Manager may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit for
good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      1.   Failure to notify the Manager of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      2.   Failure to provide prior notification to the Manager of changed
conditions pursuant to Section
7-5-6-5 of this chapter;
      3.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application;

access to the facility premises and/or records;
      8.   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      9.   Failure to pay fines;
      10.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      11.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      12.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey, or the wastewater
discharge permit application or reapplication;
      13.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility;
      14.   Violation of any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or any terms
of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter; or
      15.   Upon request by the permittee due to a change in ownership, or the
business is moving, or going out of business.
   B.   Individual wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All individual
wastewater discharge permits issued to a User are void upon the issuance of a
new individual wastewater discharge permit to that User.
   C.   Non-compliant Industrial Users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit, and will be offered the opportunity to
show cause under these standards why the proposed action should not be taken.
However, notwithstanding this or any other provision of this Chapter, the
Manager may in his or her sole discretion, immediately revoke any discharge
permit where the discharge reasonably appears to present an imminent danger to
the health or welfare of persons. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-5-7: INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REISSUANCE:

final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the User to return to the established schedule; and
   C.   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Pretreatment Coordinator. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-3: REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE:
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a New Source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any User subject
to such Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the
Pretreatment Coordinator a report containing the information described in
Section
7-5-4-5.A.6. and 7. and
7-5-6-1.B.2. of this chapter. For Users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User’s long-
term production rate. For all other Users subject to categorical Pretreatment
Standards, expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
User’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section
7-5-6-14 of this chapter. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with Section
7-5-6-10 and
7-5-6-11. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-4: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS:
   A.   All Significant Industrial Users, at a frequency determined by the
Pretreatment Coordinator, must submit reports, no less than twice per year
(June and December), indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards, and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP), or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit
documentation required by the Pretreatment Coordinator or the Pretreatment
Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User.
   B.   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section
7-5-6-14.A of this chapter.
   C.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   D.   If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently
than required by the Pretreatment Coordinator, using the procedures prescribed
in Section
7-5-6-11 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-5: REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS:
   A.   Each User must notify the Pretreatment Coordinator of any significant
changes to the User’s operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the
change, including changes that may affect slug discharges to the POTW.
Significant changes shall be considered to be changes beyond the typical
operating range of the User, or changes that would have significant impact on
POTW operations.
      1.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require the User to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
Section
7-5-4-5 of this chapter.
      2.   The Manager may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
under Section
7-5-5-7 of this chapter, or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under Section
7-5-5-4 of this chapter, in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   B.   The Manager may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the change
based on the effect the change may have on the POTW and/or the Pretreatment
Program. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-6: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge, a Slug Discharge, or Slug Load, that might cause potential problems
for the POTW, the User shall immediately notify either in person or via a phone
conversation with the Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident. A phone message
does not satisfy this notification requirement. This notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the User.
   B.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall, unless
waived by the Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge, and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any fines, penalties,
or other liability, which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees of the notification procedures in the
event of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   D.   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a Slug Discharge. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-7: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All Users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
(Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-8: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User shall notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the
Industrial User is not required if: 1) SGRWRF performs scheduled sampling at
the facility at least once a month; 2) if SGRWRF performs sampling at the
facility, between the time when the initial sampling was conducted, and the
time when the User receives the results of the initial sampling; or, 3) if
SGRWRF has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User,
then SGRWRF will perform the repeat sampling and analysis, unless it notifies
the User of the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat sampling
and analysis. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-9: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the User discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information: 1) an identification
of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 2) an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month; and 3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in
the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section
7-5-6-5 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this Section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections
7-5-6-1,
7-5-6-3, and
7-5-6-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the User
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA,
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User shall notify the Manager,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated.
   E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, by a permit issued
thereunder, or by any applicable Federal, State, or local law. (Ord. 2018-27,
11-14-2018)
7-5-6-10: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other
requirement by this chapter, shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods,
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
   B.   All laboratory samples collected for this chapter shall be analyzed by
a laboratory that is either certified by the Utah Bureau of Laboratory
Improvements or approved by the Manager. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-11: SAMPLE COLLECTION:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   A.   Except as indicated in Section B and C below, the User must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by SGRWRF, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: 1) for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; and 2) for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters, unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies, may be
authorized by SGRWRF, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required
to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.
   B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds, must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
   C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in Section
7-5-6-1 and
7-5-6-3, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Section
7-5-6-4, the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment
Standards and Requirements. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-12: DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS:
Written reports are deemed submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which
are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United
States Postal Service, the date the report is received shall govern. (Ord.
2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-6-13: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional
records obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs
established under Section
7-5-2-4.C. Records shall include: 1) the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; 2) the dates
analyses were performed; 3) who performed the analyses; 4) the analytical
techniques or methods used; and 5) the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the User or SGRWRF, or where the User has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Pretreatment Coordinator. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-
2018)
7-5-6-14: CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS:

imprisonment for knowing violations. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-7: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
7-5-7-1: RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The Manager or his or her designee shall have the right to enter the premises
of any User to determine whether the User is complying with all requirements of
this chapter, and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the Manager or his or her designee ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and/or the performance of any additional duties.
Inspections and monitoring shall be conducted as frequently as determined by
the SGRWRF and may be announced or unannounced.
   A.   Where a User has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards, so, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the Manager shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purpose of performing his or her duties.
   B.   The Manager shall have the right to set up on the User’s property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the User’s operations.
   C.   The Manager may require the User to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated at least annually, or as required per the manufacturer’s
recommendations and specifications to ensure their accuracy.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be removed promptly by the User
at the verbal or written request of the Manager and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such obstruction and providing safe and easy access shall be
borne by the User.
   E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Manager or his or her designee
access to the User’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   F.   The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or
near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and analysis. Whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facility should be provided in accordance with the SGRWRF’s
requirements, and all applicable local construction standard and
specifications. Such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a manner
that enables the Manager to perform independent monitoring activities.
   G.   All Significant Industrial Users will be inspected at least annually
including review of facilities and reports.
   H.   SGRWRF may use a camera to photograph areas of the facility as
necessary for carrying out the duties of the Industrial Pretreatment Program
including, but not limited to, documentation of the User’s compliance status
and for reinforcement of written reports. The User shall be allowed to review
copies of the photographs for confidentiality claims. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-
2018)
7-5-7-2: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the Manager or his or her designee has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of SGRWRF designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the Manager may seek issuance of a
search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-
2018)
7-5-8: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Manager inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Manager, that the release of specific information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
User furnishing a report that specific information should be held confidential,
the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall be redacted and not made available for inspection by the public.
Regardless of any such assertion of confidentiality, all information,
unredacted, shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the UPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person or entity furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics, and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information
and shall be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-
2018)
7-5-9: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The Manager shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by POTW, a
list of the Users, which at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all
Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User that violates
paragraphs (C), (D) or (H) of this Section) and shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
7-5-2;
   B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
7-5-2 multiplied by the applicable TRC criteria (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oils and grease, and TRC=1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section
7-5-2 (Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that the Manager determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including endangering the
health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Manager exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.    Failure to meet within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which the Manager determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local Pretreatment Program. (Ord. 2018-27,
11-14-2018)
7-5-10: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
7-5-10-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the
Manager may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation, personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). Within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, including specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the User to the Manager. Submission of such a
plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section
shall limit the authority of the Manager to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, before or without issuing a
Notice of Violation. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-10-2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The Manager may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
7-5-10-4 and
7-5-10-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2018-27,
11-14-2018)
7-5-10-3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The Manager may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear
before the Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place
for the show cause hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section
7-5-1-4.C. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-10-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the
Manager may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing
that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-10-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that
the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may issue an order
to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the User to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-10-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the Manager may fine such User an amount not to exceed $5,000.
Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one point five
percent (1.5%) per month. A lien against the User’s real and/or personal
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Manager to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount,
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the User’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereon, shall be
returned to the User. The Manager may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-
14-2018)
7-5-10-7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The Manager may immediately suspend a User’s discharge whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause, an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. The Manager may also immediately suspend a User’s
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension of a permit and/or
discharge to the POTW.
   A.   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to persons or the environment. The Manager may allow the User to
recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of
the Manager, that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in Section
7-5-10-8 of this chapter are initiated against the User.
   B.   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution, and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence. The written statement shall be submitted to the
Manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
Sections
7-5-10-3 or
7-5-10-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-10-8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
   A.   Violations Subject to Discharge Termination. In addition to the
provisions in Section
7-5-5-6 of this chapter, any User who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      1.   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of access to the User’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
7-5-2 of this chapter.
   B.   Notice of Discharge Termination. User will be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
Section
7-5-10-3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-11: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
7-5-11-1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the
Manager may petition the Washington County Fifth District Court through the
City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement, imposed by
this chapter on activities of the User. The Manager may also seek such other
and further relief in law or equity, including a requirement for the User to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-11-2: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, shall be liable to the City

monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The SGRWRF may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs,
interest, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any other actual damages
incurred by the City.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained by the User from the User’s violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-
14-2018)
7-5-11-3: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
The SGRWRF will refer to the State of Utah criminal violations of any
Pretreatment Standards or permit conditions. The Attorney General’s office for
Utah will offer Washington City, wherein the violation occurred, the option to
prosecute the violator. Should the local entity decline, the State or EPA, at
their discretion, may initiate appropriate criminal action. The SGRWRF will
assist the Attorney General’s office or EPA any way it can with appropriate
support for the action. The penalties set forth herein are in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under
State or Federal law.
   A.   A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this

filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Ordinance, individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall guilty of a third degree
felony, and be subject to a penalty of not more than $50,000, per violation,
per day, or imprisonment for not more than five (5) years, or both.
   D.   In the event of a second or subsequent conviction a User shall be
punished by a fine of not more than $50,000 per violation per day, or
imprisonment for not more than five (5) years, or both. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-
2018)
7-5-11-4: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The SGRWRF may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions, against a noncompliant
User, simultaneously or otherwise. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
generally will be in accordance with the SGRWRF’s enforcement response plan.
However, SGRWRF may take other action against a User when the circumstances
warrant. Further, SGRWRF is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against a noncompliant User. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-12: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
7-5-12-1: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The Manager may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless such User first files
a satisfactory bond, payable to Washington City, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the Manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-12-2: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The Manager may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless the User first
submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore
or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge, including, but not
limited to, liability insurance. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-12-3: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, water service to the User
may be severed. Service will recommence, at the User’s expense, only after the
User has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-
14-2018)
7-5-12-4: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
Whenever a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, it hereby is declared a
public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Manager.
Any person or entity creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of Washington City Ordinance (Title 4 Chapter 2) governing such
nuisances, including, but not limited to, reimbursing the City for any costs
incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-
14-2018)
7-5-13: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
7-5-13-1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
User. Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards, if the requirements
of paragraph (C), below, are met.
   C.   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility at the time was being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner, and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
      3.   The User has submitted the following information to the Manager
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, and, if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, and until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other situations, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-
14-2018)
7-5-13-2: BYPASS:
   A.   For the purposes of this Section:
      1.   Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a User’s treatment facility.
      2.   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this Section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass.
      2.   A User shall submit oral notice to the Manager of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain: a) a description of the bypass;
b) its cause; c) the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times;
d) if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and e) steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Manager, in his or her sole discretion, may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty-four (24) hours, and the facts merit the waiver.
   D.   Bypass:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Manager may take an enforcement action
against a User, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable in order to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of
this Section.
      2.   The Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Manager determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in paragraph D.1. of this Section.
      3.   Bypass shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards, if the requirements
of this paragraph D. are met. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-14: FATS, OILS, GREASE, AND SOIL (FOGS) CONTROL:
7-5-14-1: GENERAL:
The following Section is applicable to Commercial and Industrial Users that
have the potential to discharge deleterious wastewaters containing elevated
levels of fat, oils, grease and/or soil to the POTW. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-14-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following definitions are supplemental to the Washington City Pretreatment
Ordinance (this chapter) and applicable to this Section:
   A.   Commercial User - Any business or public or private entity, except for
Significant Industrial Users (SIU), who causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into the POTW; and who may be regulated, where
necessary, to comply with the Washington City Ordinance (this chapter).
   B.   Common Interceptor - One or more interceptors receiving deleterious
wastewater from more than one establishment.
   C.   FOG - Fats, oil and grease of vegetable and animal origin.
   D.   FOGS - Fats, oil, grease (of vegetable and animal origin), petroleum
oils (or crude oil origin), and soil (sand, dirt, etc.).
   E.   Food Service Establishment (FSE) - means any building, vehicle, place,
or structure, or any room or division in a building, vehicle, place, or
structure, where: 1) food is prepared, served, or sold for immediate
consumption on or in the vicinity of the premises; 2) called for or taken out
by customers; or 3) prepared prior to being delivered to another location for
consumption.
   F.   Grease Interceptor - A structure or device designed for the purpose of
removing and preventing fats, oils, and grease from entering the sanitary sewer
collection system. These devices are below-ground units in outside areas with a
minimum capacity of 1000 gallons.
   G.   Grease Trap - A device designed for the purpose of removing and
preventing fats, oils, and grease from entering the sanitary sewer collection
system. These devices are typically compact, under-the-sink units located near
food preparation areas. (Ord. 2018-27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-14-3: INTERCEPTOR AND TRAP INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS:
   A.   Grease and Sand/Oil Interceptors, as described by the International
Plumbing Code (IPC), shall be required of any Commercial User when the SGRWRF
determines they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
FOGS in excessive amounts, except such interceptors shall not be required for
residential dwelling units.
   B.   Any Commercial User utilizing a three compartment sink shall be
required to have either a grease interceptor or grease trap installed at its
own expense and shall be required to comply with maintaining the device as
outlined in the St. George City Pretreatment Operating Plan.
   C.   All construction plans for interceptors shall be submitted to SGRWRF
for review and approval prior to installation. All interceptors shall be of a
type, construction, and capacity approved by SGRWRF.
   D.   All interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable
of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of
substantial construction, water tight, and equipped with easily removable
covers, which are gas and water tight.
   E.   All newly constructed commercial structures, strip malls, multi-tenant
planned-occupied buildings, or planned-un-occupied buildings, shall install
independent six-inch (6") wastewater discharge lines stubbed out within each
designated future food establishment unit. If a new source commercial
structure, strip mall, or multi-tenant building has planned occupancy by one or
more businesses that do not generate FOG, and therefore do not need a grease
interceptor, and the owner of the structure does not facilitate the
installation of independent six inch wastewater discharge line and install a
common interceptor, then no future food establishments shall be permitted,
unless facilities are retrofitted for independent lines.
   F.   All newly constructed “stand alone” commercial structures, strip malls,
multi-tenant planned-occupied buildings, where a three compartment sink will be
utilized, will be required to install a grease interceptor.
   G.   All existing commercial or industrial businesses shall have one (1)
year to install an interceptor upon notification by SGRWRF, where required by
SGRWRF standards.
   H.   Interceptors for businesses that have closed shall be dewatered and
cleaned by the owner of said establishment. A representative of SGRWRF may
inspect and verify this process has been completed to the satisfaction of
SGRWRF.
   I.   Grease Traps are only allowed in place of grease interceptors when in
the opinion of the Manager it is physically impossible to install a grease
interceptor outside of the building or business. As such, a variance request
from the owner or lessee of the property must be made to SGRWRF with a
certification letter from a duly licensed Utah plumber or engineer. (Ord. 2018-
27, 11-14-2018)
7-5-14-4: GENERAL FOGS WASTE DISCHARGE LIMITS AND REQUIREMENTS:
It shall be unlawful to discharge within SGRWRF jurisdiction, any sanitary
wastewater, commercial and industrial waste, or other polluted waters, except

(Ord. 99-5, 3-10-1999)
7-5A-5: RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT FORMULAS:
For purposes of this article, the discharge characteristics of an equivalent
dwelling unit shall be composed of conventional strength wastewater flow of six
thousand (6,000) gallons per month and constituent levels of three hundred
eighty five (385) parts per million suspended solids and two hundred fifty
(250) parts per million biochemical oxygen demand. The number of residential
equivalent units shall be determined for flow, total suspended solids and
biochemical oxygen demand in establishing monthly user charges for industrial,
commercial and institutional users having constituent levels greater than those
specified for standard user classes established by the city council, such rates
shall be set under the following formula:
    C=S+(R Q)(Q)+[RB(B-250)+RT(T-385)].00834Q
 
Where:
 C  = Monthly charge for sewer service.
 S  = Monthly service charge, currently $0.50.
 RQ = Flow rate, currently $1.57 per thousand gallons.
 Q  = Average monthly sewer flow in thousand gallons, measured by average
       culinary water meter reading during the winter quarter.
 RB = BOD surcharge, currently $0.225 per pound of BOD.
 B  = Estimated or measured BOD concentration expressed in milligrams per
       liter.
 RT = TSS surcharge, currently $0.122 per pound of total suspended solids.
 T  = Estimated or measured TSS concentration expressed in milligrams per
       liter.
 
(Ord. 99-5, 3-10-1999)
7-5A-6: OIL AND GREASE STANDARD:
In addition to other standards, an oil and grease standard shall be in effect
for users. It is as follows:
   A.   No person shall discharge wastewater containing more than fifty
milligrams per liter (50 mg/l) of total oil and grease, unless a conditional
approval has been specified in the user's discharge permit issued by the
regional wastewater manager. Such conditional approval can only be authorized
if the regional wastewater manager determines that the user is not required to
comply with the federal categorical standard for oil and grease, or the user's
discharge does not injure or interfere with any wastewater collection/treatment
process, constitute a public hazard or nuisance, or cause the city to violate
its UPDES permit.
   B.   If conditional approval to exceed the fifty milligrams per liter (50
mg/l) oil and grease standard is authorized, the procedure and conditions shall
be as follows:
      1.   The wastewater shall be analyzed by the city to determine BOD5 and
the composition of polar and nonpolar oil and grease. The cost of the sampling
and analysis shall be paid for by the discharger.
      2.   The polar portion of the oil and grease concentration is assumed to

in excess of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) shall be
surcharged at the rate set forth in the surcharge formula (nomenclature as set
forth above):
C=RB(B-250)0.00834Q
      3.   The nonpolar (mineral or petroleum origin) portion of the oil and
grease concentration is assumed to be nonbiodegradable. When gasoline, machine
oil and diesel fuel are the primary wastes of concern, the established limit of
one part per million of BTEX 1  or naphthalene shall be enforced.
      4.   The total toxic organic limit, which is derived from the categorical
standard for the metal finishing industry, shall be two (2) parts per million.

7-6-4: AUTHORITY OF CITY COUNCIL:
The city council, for the efficient and economical operations of the
department, may enter into contract to: a) sell its products and services to
the public and private corporations and to other consumers; b) construct power
generating plants, transmission lines and other facilities; c) purchase real
estate and franchises; d) purchase power; and e) lease property which may be
necessary for the proper operation of the electrical system. (1989 Code § 14-
511.2)
7-6-5: SERVICE AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Form And Execution: Each applicant for service shall make a written
application therefor on the department's standard form, or execute a formal
contract. The department's standard application form, when signed by the
department's authorized representative as well as the customer, becomes a
binding service agreement. Receipt of electric service shall constitute an
agreement to abide by all provisions of the standard application form and these
electric service regulations.
   B.   Implied Service Agreement: In the absence of a signed service
agreement, the delivery of electric service by the department and acceptance
thereof by customer shall be deemed to constitute an agreement by and between
the department and the customer for delivery and acceptance of electric service
under the terms and conditions in these electric service regulations and the
applicable rate schedule.
   C.   Term Of Service Agreement: Unless otherwise provided, service
agreements are to continue in effect for an initial period of one month where a
new service is provided.
   D.   Expiration Or Renewal: Unless otherwise provided, each service
agreement will automatically extend from its expiration date for additional
successive periods of one month each, unless and until either party has
notified the other in writing, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end
of any such period, of its desire to terminate such agreement.
   E.   Department Right To Cancel Or Suspend Service: For any default or
breach of the service agreement by the customer, including failure to pay bills
within the specified period, the department, in addition to all other legal
remedies, may terminate the service agreement or suspend service at the
location where such default has occurred. No such termination or suspension,
however, will be made by the department without ten (10) days' notice to the
customer, stating in what particular manner the service agreement has been
violated, except that no notice need be given in cases of theft or unauthorized
use or disposition of service by the customer, or where in the department's
judgment, the customer is violating or threatening to violate the electric
service regulations or other ordinances, laws or codes, or the provisions of
these electric service regulations. Also, no notice need be given in case of
short circuit, or other dangerous condition on the customer's side of the point
of delivery, or in case of utilization by the customer of service in such
manner as to cause danger to persons or property, or to jeopardize service to
the customer or to others. Failure of the department at any time after any such
default or breach either to suspend supply of service, or terminate the service
agreement, or to resort to any other legal remedy, or its failure to exercise
on any one or more of such remedies, shall not affect the department's right to
resort thereafter to any one or more of such remedies for the same or any
future default or breach by the customer.
   F.   Cancellation: Unless otherwise provided in the service agreement, where
the customer entirely suspends operations with the intention to permanently
abandon them, the service agreement may be canceled by written notice to the
department not less than thirty (30) days before the date upon which service is
to be terminated. No such cancellation shall release the customer from his
prior obligation.
   G.   Change Of Customer Address:
      1.   When the customer changes his address, he shall give notice thereof
to the department at least three (3) days prior to the date of change. The
customer will be held responsible for all service supplied to the vacated
premises until such notice has been received and the department has had a
reasonable time, but not less than three (3) days, to discontinue service.
      2.   If the customer moves to an address at which he requires electric
service for any purposes specified in his service agreement, and at which
address the department has such service available under the same rate schedule,
the notice shall be considered as the customer's request that the department
transfer such service to the new address; but if the department does not have
such service available at the new address, the old service agreement shall, at
the option of the department, either be considered canceled or the customer
remain liable thereunder. If the department has service available at the new
address to which a different rate schedule applies, a new service agreement,
including the applicable rate schedule, will be offered to the customer. The
department will make transfers of service as promptly as reasonably possible
after receipt of notice.
   H.   Successor And Assigns: Service agreements shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the respective heirs, legal representatives or successors
by operation of law, of the parties thereto. The customer may assign his
service agreement to a third party only with the written consent of the
department. The department may, without the customer's consent, assign any
service agreement to any person or corporation, in any lawful way acquiring or
operating all or any part of the department's property used in supplying
service under such agreement. (1989 Code § 14-612)
7-6-6: USE OF RIGHT OF WAY:
The department may use the property over, under or along any public street,
sidewalk or other right of way in the operations of the department; but said

the city and cause the surface of the public way to be restored to its usual
condition. (1989 Code § 14-511.4)
7-6-7: ADVERTISING:
The city council may authorize reasonable expenditures to advertise and promote
the use of services of the department and to acquaint the public with the
operations, programs and planned expansion of the department and city
electrical power system. (1989 Code § 14-511.6)
7-6-8: BUDGET AND RECORDS:
   A.   Budget Preparation: The department shall furnish a proposed budget for
the department to the city manager for each fiscal year so that it may be
incorporated in the general budget of the city. Said proposed budget shall be
subject to a review process as outlined in Utah Code Annotated section 10-6-
111.
   B.   Maintenance Of Accounts And Records: The accounts and records of the
department shall be maintained by city offices, but shall be kept separately
from the general accounts and funds of the city, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by state law or other city ordinances.
   C.   Transfer Of Surplus Funds: The city council shall have the power to
transfer to the city treasury all surplus funds which in their best judgment

other municipality or individual for the joint use of poles and other property
belonging to the city or to the other party. The city council may also contract
with any other party for the joint acquisition of real property and franchises,
and the joint financing, construction, operation and maintenance of power
generating facilities, transmission lines and other property. (1989 Code § 14-
511.8)
7-6-10: OCCUPANCY PERMIT REQUIRED:

electric service is provided. The permit shall be signed by the chief building
inspector. (1989 Code § 14-511.23; amd. 2007 Code)
7-6-11: RATES, FEES AND DEPOSITS; DELINQUENCY:
   A.   Service Rates:
      1.   The city council shall fix rates to be charged for electricity sold
and services rendered by the department. Rates shall be fair, reasonable and
compensatory and shall be uniform for all consumers within the same class; but
different rate schedules may be applied to different classes of consumers as
determined by the city council. Rates within the city limits may be less but
shall be no greater than for the same class of consumers outside the city
limits. Rates shall be sufficient to pay all operating and maintenance expenses
of the department and all bond interest and redemption costs of the electrical
power system. The city council may require reasonable deposits as security for
the payment of charges for services and may provide for the return of said
deposits when satisfactory consumer credit has been established.
      2.   The city offices shall administer the collection of any and all
funds generated by the department.
      3.   The rates charged for electric services shall be established by
resolution of the city council. (1989 Code § 14-511.5; amd. 2007 Code)
   B.   Selection And Application Of Rate Schedules:
      1.   Selection Of Rate Schedule:
         a.   When a prospective customer makes application for service, the
department will, upon request, assist in the selection of the rate schedule
appropriate to the customer for the service requested. The selection will be
based on the prospective customer's statement as to the class of service
desired, the amount and manner of use, and any other pertinent information.
This statement will be recorded and filed with the application. The department
shall not be liable for any errors in designating the applicable schedule.
         b.   If through error a service agreement is entered into specifying a
rate schedule which is not applicable to the class of service taken, on
discovery of the error, all bills rendered during the preceding twelve (12)
months shall be recalculated in accordance with the lowest properly applicable
rate schedule, and any excess paid shall be applied on any outstanding balance
owing by the customer or, if no balance is owing, shall be refunded by the
department, or any balance due shall be paid by the customer, as the case may
be. No adjustments may be made for service provided more than twelve (12)
months prior to the date on which adjustment is first requested in writing.
      2.   Distinction Between Residential And Commercial Service: Service
rendered through one meter to apartment houses and to recognized rooming and/or
boarding houses will be considered commercial service.
      3.   Lighting On Power Schedules: Lighting service will not be supplied
under any power rate schedules unless it is so specified in such power rate
schedule, and when so supplied, the customer will provide and maintain all
auxiliary apparatus (transformers, regulators, etc.) that may be necessary.
Service supplied to motor generators, any portion of the output of which is
used for lighting purposes, shall be considered lighting service.
      4.   Temporary And Standby Service:
         a.   Temporary and standby service shall not be rendered, except under
a special agreement between the department and the customer, unless the
temporary service is provided during construction where a permanent service
will be established.
         b.   In no event will the department supply power and energy for the
purpose of starting or furnishing excitation or other auxiliary service
necessary to the operation of any of the customer's generating plant or for
parallel operation of the customer's generating equipment with the department's
system, except under a special agreement between the department and the
customer. (1989 Code § 14-618)

   D.   Connection Fees:
      1.   Residential: The city power department requires an application for
service from all new residential customers and prior to the commencement of
construction on new residences. Application for service shall be made a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the time that service is required. For
temporary service and new construction, refer to section
7-6-13 of this chapter, the temporary service policy. Each time a customer is
connected to the electrical system for electric service at a point of delivery,
or each time a customer changes his point of delivery, the customer shall be
charged a connection fee. If service to a customer is disconnected for
nonpayment of service charges, the customer shall pay all delinquent service
charges, and in addition shall pay a fifty dollar ($50.00) reconnection fee
before service will be continued. The connection fees shall be established by
resolution by the city council. (1989 Code § 14-511.20; amd. 2007 Code)
      2.   Commercial:
         a.   General: This service connection fee is for alternating current
electric service, single phase or 3-phase, supplied at the city's available
voltage at a single point of delivery for all service required on the premises
for nonresidential services. Service will be provided at any point on the city
electric system where there are existing facilities with adequate capacity.
Refer to section
7-6-17 of this chapter, the line extension policy, for areas where no
electrical facilities exist.
         b.   Application: The city power department requires an application
for service from all new commercial customers and prior to the commencement of
construction of new commercial buildings. Application shall be made a
reasonable time in advance of the time that service is required. For temporary
service and new construction, refer to section
7-6-13 of this chapter, the temporary service policy. Connection fees are due
and payable at the time of application. Each time a customer is connected to
the electrical system for electric service at a point of delivery not
previously used, or each time a customer changes his point of delivery, or each
time a customer is reconnected after an involuntary disconnection to his same
point of delivery, the customer shall be charged a connection fee. The
connection fees shall be established by resolution by the city council. (1989
Code § 14.511.21; amd. 2007 Code)
   E.   Reconnection Fee: Any person desiring reconnection of service to the
city electrical power system after said service has been turned off, shall be
required to pay, in advance, the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00). (1989 Code §
14-511.9; amd. 2007 Code)
   F.   Deposits And Refunds:
      1.   Renter Deposit:
         a.   All renters or tenants of commercial, residential or other
property shall pay a deposit, in advance, of commencement of electrical
service. Said deposit shall be in addition to the regular monthly or other
periodic payments for electricity.
         b.   Such deposits shall be received by the city treasurer and
deposited in the general account of the city and shall be retained by the city
so long as any services have not been paid for in full. The city shall use such
amount of said deposit as is needed to pay any delinquent charges for such
services not paid for by the tenant or renter.
         c.   The city council may by resolution require the landlord or owner
of rental property to be responsible for the payment of electrical power
services furnished to the property, whether or not the landlord or owner
resides upon the property. In addition, the landlord or owner may be required
to post such deposits with the city as the governing body may deem appropriate
to ensure the payment for electrical services. (1989 Code § 14-511.10; amd.
2007 Code)
      2.   Generally:
         a.   When Required: The department, at the time application for
electric service is made or at any time thereafter, may require a cash deposit
or guarantee satisfactory to the department to secure the payment of bills as
they become due. Such deposit or guarantee may be held in its entirety by the
department until final settlement of the customer's account. The amount of such
deposit may be equivalent of the estimated cost of service for ninety (90)
days, as estimated by the department.
         b.   Refunds: Deposits shall be refunded upon the customer's request
after a satisfactory payment history of twenty four (24) months. Deposits shall
be credited to the customer's bills for electric service. If the customer is
terminating service and that customer's deposit balance remains greater than
the customer's last bill, the remaining balance, after crediting the bill, may
be refunded directly to the customer. (1989 Code § 14-619)
   G.   Delinquency: All charges for electrical service shall be paid for
monthly by the customer. Any customer failing, neglecting or refusing to pay
such charges by the twentieth day of the month shall be assessed a five percent
(5%) penalty on the unpaid balance. Customers whose accounts are delinquent in
excess of thirty (30) days shall also be subject to having their electric
current shut off by the department. (1989 Code § 14-511.11)
7-6-12: SUPPLYING AND TAKING SERVICE:
   A.   Power Supply: The department supplies alternating current at
approximately sixty (60) cycles. Secondary distribution voltages are available
at 120/240 volts, 120/208 volts and 277/480 volts. The department may, at its
option, provide other voltages. All voltages are nominal and subject to
standard variation. The standard amperage shall be two hundred (200) amps.
   B.   Supply Of Service: Service will be supplied only under and pursuant to
these electric service regulations, and any modifications or additions thereto,
and such applicable rate or rates as may from time to time be adopted. Service
will be supplied under a given rate schedule only at such points of delivery as
are adjacent to facilities of the department and are adequate and suitable as
to capacity and voltage for the service desired. Otherwise, special agreements
between the customer and the department may be required.
   C.   Continuity Of Service: The department will use reasonable diligence to
supply steady and continuous service, but does not guarantee the service
against irregularities or interruptions. The department shall not be liable to
the customer for any injury, loss or damages occasioned by or related to
irregularities or interruptions from whatever cause, nor shall such
interruption or irregularity constitute a default in the service agreement or
on the part of the department.
   D.   Compliance With Regulations:
      1.   If compliance with orders or formal requests of any governmental
agency, curtailing or diverting the department's available electric power
resources, makes it impossible for the department to supply the full electric
power requirements of all its customers, the department shall not be liable for
any injury or loss caused by the resultant curtailment, in whole or in part, of
its supply to any customer. If any such curtailment reduces the amount of power
available to a customer below the minimum amount contracted for, such a
customer shall be relieved of the obligation to pay more than the amount of
power from time to time made available by the department. Such other
adjustments in amounts payable by the customer will be made as may be
equitable, taking into consideration the time and extent of curtailment.
      2.   Inability on the part of the department to meets its contractual
obligations to any customer, when such inability is due to the department's
compliance with an order or formal request of a governmental agency, shall not
constitute default on the part of the department as to any contract or
agreement, and any contract or agreement affected by such compliance shall
remain in full force and effect except as necessarily modified during the
effective period of such order or formal request.
   E.   Suspension Of Service For Repairs And Changes: When necessary to make
repairs or changes in the department electric facilities or other property, the
department may, without incurring any liability therefor, suspend service for
such periods as may be reasonably necessary and in such manner as not to
inconvenience the customer unnecessarily.
   F.   Use Of Service: Service shall be supplied directly to the customer
through the department's own meter, and shall be used by the customer only for
the purposes specified in and in accordance with the provisions of the service
agreement. Service shall be for the customer's use only, and under no
circumstances may the customer or the customer's agent, or any other individual
association or corporation install meters or other apparatus or facilities for
the purpose of remetering or reselling or otherwise disposing of service
supplied the customer to lessees, tenants or others, except in accordance with
a service agreement of the department which specifically authorizes such use of
the service. In no case shall the customer, except with the consent of the
department, extend or connect his installation to lines across or under a
street, alley, lane, court or avenue or other public or private space in order
to obtain service for an adjacent property through one meter, even though such
adjacent property be owned by the customer. In case such unauthorized
remetering, sale, extension or other disposition of service, the department may
immediately discontinue the supplying of service to the customer until such
unauthorized remetering, sale or act is discontinued and full payment is made
for all service supplied or used, billed on proper classification rate
schedules and reimbursement in full is made to the department for all extra
expenses incurred, including attorney fees, expenses for clerical work, testing
and inspections.
   G.   Right Of Way: Without reimbursement, the customer shall make or procure
conveyance to the department of right of way satisfactory to the department

(ESUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ESU is the most
accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes
to, benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility.
   B.   Calculation: The city council finds that each single-family residential
parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff;
therefore, each developed single-family residential parcel shall pay a base
rate of one ESU. All nonsingle-family residential parcels shall pay a multiple
of this base rate, expressed in ESUs, calculated by dividing total square feet
of impervious surface by three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet,
rounded to the nearest whole number.
   C.   Charge Per ESU: The amount charged for each ESU may be established by
resolution of the city council.
   D.   Exemptions And Credits: The city council may establish exemptions and
credits to the storm water utility fee by resolution.
   E.   Policies: The public works department may adopt policies, consistent
with this chapter and any resolution passed by the city council, to assist in
the application, administration and interpretation of this chapter and any
resolutions related to the storm water utility.
   F.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter, or any
storm water utility rate resolution, was interpreted or applied erroneously to
their property, may appeal to the public works director ("director") designee.
The appeals shall be in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal,
and shall be made within ten (10) days of when the appeal was filed. (Ord.
2004-14, 6-9-2004)
7-7-4: BILLING:
The city council finds that the city storm water and sewer system, sanitary
sewer water, culinary sewer water and solid waste collection systems are
interrelated services that are a part of a unified city plan for the health,
safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally
responsible manner. Therefore, the storm water utility fee shall be included on
the city's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. Failure to pay
any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water/electrical
services. (Ord. 2004-14, 6-9-2004)

land use approval that is filed on or after the date of adoption for any New
Development or Redevelopment within the Municipality that Discharges Stormwater
to the Municipality’s MS4 and to associated Stormwater Management Facilities.
   B.   Exception. This chapter does not apply to New Development or
Redevelopment on a lot, tract or parcel where that lot, tract or parcel is part
of a subdivision that is approved under this chapter; said lot, tract or parcel
shall not require separate review under this chapter, but shall comply with the
Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan requirements for that approved
subdivision. (Ord. 2020-16, 9-9-2020)
8-7-6: POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL:
   A.   General Requirement. Except as provided in Section 5.B. above, no
Applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, site plan approval or
other land use approval for New Development or Redevelopment to which this
chapter is applicable shall receive such permit or approval for that New
Development or Redevelopment unless the Municipal Permitting Authority for that
New Development or Redevelopment also determines that the Applicant’s Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan for that New Development or
Redevelopment meets the requirements of this chapter and the Maintenance
Agreement has been recorded in the office of the Washington County Recorder.
   B.   Performance Standards
      1.   Stormwater Treatment Required. The Applicant shall make adequate
provision for the management of the quantity and quality of all stormwater
generated by the New Development or Redevelopment through a Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Plan. This Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan
shall be designed by a Professional Engineer to meet the standards contained in
the Grading Manual and must include evaluation of Low Impact Development as
well as fully comply with all practices described in the Storm Water General
Permit.
      2.    Location of Facilities. The Applicant may meet the quantity and
quality standards above either on-site or off-site, but where off-site
facilities are used, the Applicant must submit to the Municipality
documentation, approved as to legal sufficiency by the Municipality’s attorney,
that the Applicant has a sufficient property interest in the property where the
off-site facilities are located -- by easement, covenant or other appropriate
legal instrument -- to ensure that the facilities will be able to provide post-
construction stormwater management for the New Development or Redevelopment and
that the property will not be altered in a way that interferes with the off-
site facilities.
      3.   Maintenance Agreement Required. Where the Applicant proposes to
retain ownership of the Stormwater Management Facilities shown in its Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan, the Applicant shall submit to the
Municipality documentation, approved as to legal sufficiency by the
Municipality’s attorney that the Applicant, its successors, heirs and assigns
shall have the legal obligation and the resources available to operate, repair,
maintain and replace the stormwater management facilities. Applications for New
Development or Redevelopment requiring Stormwater Management Facilities shall
enter into a Maintenance Agreement with the Municipality. A sample of this
Maintenance Agreement is on file with the city.
      4.   Easements and Dedications. Whenever elements of the Stormwater
Management Facilities are not within the right-of-way of a public street and
the facilities will not be offered to the Municipality for acceptance as public
facilities, the Municipal Permitting Authority may require that perpetual
easements conforming substantially with the lines of existing natural drainage,
and in a form acceptable to the Municipality’s attorney, shall be provided to
the Municipality allowing access for maintenance, repair, replacement and
improvement of the Stormwater Management Facilities. When an offer of
dedication is required by the Municipal Permitting Authority, the Applicant
shall be responsible for the maintenance of these Stormwater Management
Facilities under this chapter until such time (if ever) as they are accepted by
the Municipality.
      5.   Conflict with State Laws or Rules. In addition to any other
applicable requirements of this chapter and the Municipality’s land use
ordinances, any New Development or Redevelopment which also requires a
stormwater management permit from the State of Utah Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ) shall comply with the rules adopted by DEQ, as the same may be
amended from time to time, and the Applicant shall document such compliance to
the Municipal Permitting Authority. Where the standards or other provisions of
such stormwater rules conflict with municipal ordinances, the stricter (more
protective) standard shall apply.
      6.   Engineering and administrative fees. At the time of application, the
Applicant shall pay to the Municipality a fee as reflected on the Washington
City Master Fee Schedule for the review of the proposal unless it is determined
by the Public Works Department that a third party review of the proposal is
necessary. If it is determined that a third party review is necessary an
estimate will be provided to the owner for payment prior to review by third
party.
      In addition, any persons required to file an annual certification under
Section
8-7-7  of this chapter shall pay, prior to the issuance of any temporary or
permanent certificate of compliance for the New Development or Redevelopment, a
fee as reflected on the Washington City Master Fee Schedule for review of the
annual certification.
      7.   Notice of BMP Discharge to Municipality’s MS4. At the time of
application, the Applicant shall notify the Municipal Permitting Authority if
its Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan includes any BMP(s) that will
discharge to the Municipality’s MS4 and shall include in this notification a
listing of which BMP(s) will so discharge.
      8.   As-Built Certification. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Compliance for a project requiring a Post-Construction Stormwater Management
Plan under this chapter, the Applicant shall submit evidence in the form of a
letter or plan prepared and stamped by a Professional Engineer who either
prepared the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan and its associated
Facilities or supervised the Plan and Facilities construction and
implementation. The letter or plan shall certify that the Stormwater Management
Facilities have been installed in accordance with the approved Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Plan and that they will function as intended
by said Plan. This certification must specifically include any LID measures
incorporated into the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan and the as
constructed volume of each toward the 80th percentile retention requirement.
Any LID features to be constructed at a later date (such as facilities on
individual building lots) shall be specifically approved by the City Council at
the time of preliminary plat. If the LID proposal is approved, the requirements
of such facility shall record as a deed restriction against the property and
have notes placed upon the final plat describing the specific requirements for
said features. (Ord. 2020-16, 9-9-2020)
8-7-7: POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN COMPLIANCE:
   A.   General Requirements. Any Person owning, operating, leasing or having
control over Stormwater Management Facilities required by a Post-Construction

9-8A-7: BONUS DENSITY PROGRAM:
   A.   Program Outline: Specific areas in the Washington Fields area and some
of the area north of I-15 have been designated as bonus density areas on the
general plan land use map to provide incentives that will help preserve open
space. These areas are allowed a base density of one dwelling unit per acre,
which corresponds to the RA-1 zone. However, bonus density credits may be given
as multiples of the base density for specific open space amenities (outlined
below) that are incorporated into developments and are beneficial to the
public. If higher density zoning is present at the time of subdivision or
rezoning, credits are reduced proportionally. If all of the credits were to be
granted, a property could theoretically achieve a density of three and five-
tenths plus (3.5+) units per acre (2.5 plus units per acre in bonus density,
plus the original 1 unit per acre in base density). However, it is unlikely
that all of the density bonus categories could or would be earned on a given
parcel (e.g., it is not desirable to have a public park on every parcel), plus
there must be a density cap to meet the intent of the general plan. Therefore,
the actual density increases resulting will average close to the two and five-
tenths (2.5) units per acre identified as a goal in the general plan.
   B.   Program Participation: If the property is already zoned RA-1, then an
applicant may simply propose a subdivision that meets the RA-1 zone development
standards. If the applicant wants to participate in the bonus density program,
a development agreement may be proposed that incorporates the open space
amenities for the bonus density credits, along with a proposed subdivision. If
the property has a zoning designation that is less dense than the RA-1 zone,
then a zone change request to RA-1 must first be approved by the city council
after a recommendation by the planning commission. If the applicant wants to
participate in the bonus density program, a development agreement may be
proposed along with the zone change request, or the applicant may wait until
the RA-1 zone is approved and then propose a development agreement along with a
proposed subdivision. If the applicant does not want to participate in the
bonus density program, then a proposed subdivision must meet the RA-1 zone
development standards. If the property has a zoning designation that is more
dense than the RA-1 zone and an applicant wants to participate in the bonus
density program, density credits will be proportionally reduced and identified
in a development agreement.
   C.   Modified Area, Width And Yard Regulations: Since the purpose of the
bonus density program is to help preserve open space, lots in a subdivision may
be clustered and the areas of the lots may be reduced. As lots are reduced in
size, their widths and minimum yard setbacks must also be proportionally
reduced in size. Lot setbacks must be noted on the final plat of each
subdivision. The following table outlines the modified area, width and yard
regulations for lots when an applicant participates in the bonus density
program:
                             Yards In Feet
Area In Square Feet1 Width2  Front Side Rear
(Closest Size Range) In Feet
                                    Yards In Feet
Area In Square Feet1        Width2  Front Side            Rear

(absolute minimum lot size)
         8,000        7020          8 an1010
         10,000       8020          10 a20 10
         12,000       9020          10 a20 10
         15,000       1020          10 a20 10
         21,780       1020          10 a20 10
    (1/2 acre)
         30,000       1020          15 a20 15
         40,000       2030          15 a30 15
         43,560       2030          15 a30 15
    (1 acre)
 
Notes:
      1.   The absolute minimum lot size is 6,000 square feet. The smallest
lots of a subdivision are to be internal to the project, and the lot sizes
along the subdivision boundaries are to be within a single density transition
category of adjacent properties.
      2.   Unlike the minimum yard setbacks, the lot widths are more of a
general guideline than a minimum standard. The intent is for the lot widths to
be proportional to the corresponding lot size range. It is undesirable to have
lots extremely narrow compared to their depths. Each proposed subdivision will
be evaluated to see if this intent is being met. Flag lots may also be
considered for properties that have irregular shapes and/or topography.
   D.   Open Space Amenities And Bonus Density Credits:
      1.   Interconnectivity Of Internal Streets: Streets connect to each other
within the project to create an informal grid that provides multiple routes for
emergency vehicles and distributes traffic evenly through a neighborhood. To
qualify for this density bonus, no more than twenty percent (20%) of the lots
shall be located on cul-de- sacs.
Credit:    Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density.
      2.   Interconnectivity Of External Streets: Streets connect to adjoining
parcels/subdivisions to create an informal grid that provides multiple routes
for emergency vehicles and distributes traffic evenly through a subarea. To
qualify for this density bonus, access streets in addition to what is already
required (the basic minimum number of access streets for each subdivision is 2,
but larger subdivisions or subdivisions that have specific access and/or
circulation issues may require more than 2 access streets), shall be provided,
and the additional connecting streets provided shall be stubbed internal to
adjacent properties and not perpendicular to streets external to the
development.
Credit:    Fifteen percent (15%) increase in density for one additional street.
Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density for more than one additional
street.
      3.   Houses Facing Onto Arterial And Major Collector Streets: It is
acknowledged that major and minor arterial streets (106 foot and 80 foot rights
of way) and major collector streets (66 foot rights of way) are designed to
optimize for traffic capacity and speed. Residential lots may be allowed to
back (double frontage lots) onto arterial and major collector streets as long
as there are adequate setbacks and landscape screening. Additionally,
residential streets (60 foot and 50 foot rights of way) are intended to
optimize for convenient travel, safe mixing of pedestrians and vehicles, and to
be attractive settings for homes. Accordingly, double frontage lots are not
allowed (except in cases of topographical constraints and factors relating to
safety) along residential streets. It is possible to front homes onto arterial
and major collector streets through the use of rear alleys or frontage roads.
To qualify for this density bonus, double frontage lots are not allowed on
streets classified as arterials (106 foot and 80 foot rights of way) and major
collectors (66 foot rights of way). Keep in mind that intersection spacing must
meet city standards for alleys and frontage roads as well as all other streets.
(Note: Except in cases of topographical constraints and factors relating to
safety, and if it makes no difference to traffic impacts, double frontage lots
are prohibited along rights of way less than 66 feet.)
Credit:    Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density.
      4.   Mix Of Lot Sizes: Consistent with the general plan, the objective of
this incentive is to encourage developments that have a mix of lot sizes so as
to create a varied appearance (avoiding "cookie cutter" character). To qualify
for this density bonus, credit is given for distinct variations in lot sizes.
Credit:    Five percent (5%) increase in density for each variation of lot size
that pertains to at least ten percent (10%) of the lots (a variation is a
change of at least 25 percent in lot size), up to a maximum of twenty five
percent (25%). To qualify for this density bonus, no more than fifty percent
(50%) of the area may be within one size range (±12.5 percent constitutes a
size range).
      5.   Neighborhood Park Land Dedication: Through the general plan, the
city has adopted a neighborhood park level of service (LOS) standard of six (6)
acres of park for every one thousand (1,000) population. In circumstances where
a development does not actually generate a need for at least a four (4) acre
park (minimum size for efficient city maintenance), this density bonus provides
an incentive to dedicate additional park land without losing development units.
To qualify for this density bonus, land in excess of the LOS standard for the
proposed development shall be conveyed to the city, the park must be
constructed, it must be four (4) acres or more, and its design must be accepted
by the city.
Credit:    Five percent (5%) increase in density for each one percent (1%) of
the site dedicated to park land that is in excess of the city neighborhood park
level of service standard (6 acres per 1,000 population), up to a maximum of
twenty five percent (25%).
      6.   Provisions For Affordable Housing: "Moderate income housing" (or
affordable housing) is defined as housing occupied or reserved for occupancy by
households with a gross household income equal to or less than eighty percent
(80%) of the median gross income for households of the same size in the county
in which the city is located. Although providing for affordable housing is not
a method for preserving open space, it is a public amenity listed in the bonus
density program of the general plan, and may be included as a means to receive
an increase in density as long as other open space amenities are incorporated
into the development. Some of the techniques used to provide for affordable
housing include the utilization of state or federal funds or tax incentives to
promote the construction of moderate income housing, the utilization of
programs offered by the Utah housing corporation, and the utilization of
affordable housing programs administered by the Utah department of community
and economic development. To qualify for this density bonus, a minimum of four
(4) additional categories of the bonus density program must be implemented in
the development and include the "public trails through and along the
development" category, the design and quality of the moderate income housing
shall be similar to the design and quality of all other housing in the
development, and a minimum of five percent (5%) of the total housing must be
dedicated to moderate income housing.
Credit:    Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density for five percent (5%)
of the total housing dedicated to moderate income housing.
Fifty percent (50%) increase in density for ten percent (10%) or more of the
total housing dedicated to moderate income housing.
      7.   Landscaped Open Space: The objective of this density bonus is to
encourage provisions for open areas that, pursuant to the general plan,
preserve the open space character of the Washington Fields area and the area
north of I-15. To qualify for this density bonus, the development shall provide
for landscaped open space, with at least fifty percent (50%) of the landscaped
areas visible from public streets. Landscaping shall be reflective of the area
in which it is located and shall be developed as approved by the city.
Xeriscape landscaping (drought tolerant vegetation) is encouraged for the type
of vegetation, but the amount of vegetation must be dense enough to reflect the
greenery of the area (especially if irrigation rights are still available for
property in the Washington Fields area). Shade trees and shrubs shall be an
integral part of the landscaping and shall meet sight distance requirements.
All landscaping shall be installed by the developer and shall be maintained by
the homeowners' association. The responsibility for landscape maintenance shall
be cited on the plat, in the development agreement, and recorded against the
properties within the development.
Credit:    Three percent (3%) increase in density for each one percent (1%) of
the site preserved in open space (not including areas within rights of way or
areas that have received credit through other provisions of the bonus density
program), up to a maximum of twenty five percent (25%).
      8.   Open Space At Intersection Corners At Periphery Of Development:
Pursuant to the general plan, open areas created at intersection corners at the
periphery of a development will generally make a greater contribution to
preserving the open space character of the Washington Fields area and the area
north of I-15 than open space internal to a development. To qualify for this
density bonus, landscaping shall be reflective of the area in which it is
located and shall be developed as approved by the city. Xeriscape landscaping
(drought tolerant vegetation) is encouraged for the type of vegetation, but the
amount of vegetation must be dense enough to reflect the greenery of the area
(especially if irrigation rights are still available for property in the
Washington Fields area). Shade trees and shrubs shall be an integral part of
the landscaping and shall meet sight distance requirements. All landscaping
shall be installed by the developer and shall be maintained by the homeowners'
association. The responsibility for landscape maintenance shall be cited on the
plat, in the development agreement, and recorded against the properties within
the development.
Credit:    Five percent (5%) increase in density for each one percent (1%) of
the site preserved in open space that is located at intersection corners (not
including areas within rights of way or areas that have received credit through
other provisions of the bonus density program), up to a maximum of twenty five
percent (25%).
      9.   Landscaped Rights Of Way And Front Yard Setbacks Along Arterials And
Major Collectors: It is the city's desire, pursuant to the general plan, to
preserve the open space character of the Washington Fields area and the area
north of I-15 by having generous building setbacks with broad landscaped areas
defined by open fencing. Therefore, along these major corridors, the following
choices are available to qualify for a selection of density bonuses:
         a.   An additional landscape setback between the street ROW line and
fence/wall of the development, beyond the required landscape strip for double
frontage lots, shall be installed by the developer and shall be maintained by
the homeowners' association. The responsibility for landscape maintenance shall
be cited on the plat, in the development agreement, and recorded against the
properties within the development. An average width of fifty feet (50') is
desirable, with the width varying between thirty feet (30') and seventy feet
(70'). A landscape setback of at least thirty feet (30') is required to get a
density bonus.
         b.   Landscaping shall be reflective of the area in which it is
located and shall be developed as approved by the city. Xeriscape landscaping
(drought tolerant vegetation) is encouraged for the type of vegetation, but the
amount of vegetation must be dense enough to reflect the greenery of the area
(especially if irrigation rights are still available for property in the
Washington Fields area). Shade trees and shrubs shall be an integral part of
the landscaping and shall meet sight distance requirements.
         c.   The desired fencing along the major roadway corridors is open
three (3) rail or four (4) rail fencing. Wrought iron fencing and/or solid
fence/wall panels may be as approved by the city if they match or are
compatible with fences of adjoining developments. Overall transparency of at
least fifty percent (50%) is required to get a density bonus. (Note: Thin wire
mesh fencing, as approved by the city, may be used to confine animals and/or
children.)
Credit:    If a landscape setback varying between thirty feet (30') and seventy
feet (70'), with an average of at least fifty feet (50') is created, with no
section less than thirty feet (30') wide, the bonus density will be five
percent (5%) for each one percent (1%) of the total land area of the parcel
that is in the landscape setback, up to a maximum of twenty five percent (25%).
Where homes face arterials and major collectors, a five percent (5%) density
credit will be granted for each ten feet (10') of building setback beyond the
minimum front yard setback of the closest size range, up to a maximum of twenty
five percent (25%).
If fencing is less than seventy five percent (75%) transparent but at least
fifty percent (50%) transparent, a density increase may be transferred to the
rest of the property. The density credit will be derived by dividing the area
of the landscape setback by the average lot size of the development.
(Hypothetical example: 30 foot landscape setback x 1,000 foot property length =
30,000 square feet/15,000 square foot average lot size = total of 2 additional
lots.)
If fencing is seventy five percent (75%) or more transparent, a density
increase may be transferred to the rest of the property. The density credit
will be derived by dividing the area of the landscape setback by the average
lot size of the development, plus fifty percent (50%). (Hypothetical example:
30 foot landscape setback x 1,000 foot property length = 30,000 square feet/
15,000 square foot average lot size = 2 units + 50 percent = total of 3
additional lots.)
      10.   Public Trails Through And Along Development: Where indicated in the
general plan and/or city trails plan, the proposed development shall provide
public trails that generally follow trail alignments shown in said plans.
Unless otherwise approved by the city, trail alignments must traverse through
the property or around its periphery, according to the plans. To qualify for
this density bonus, trails shall be open to the general public, and shall
connect to adjacent trails, parks, open space and public streets, in a manner
as approved by the city. The trails shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide,
meet AASHTO standards, and shall be installed by the developer. Trail
maintenance responsibility will be as agreed upon in the development agreement.
If trails are proposed that are not indicated in the general plan and/or city
trails plan, a density bonus may be granted for these trails as well. To
qualify for a density bonus for these trails, the same criteria as outlined for
trails indicated in the general plan and/or city trails plan shall be met.
Again, trail maintenance responsibility will be as agreed upon in the
development agreement.
Credit:    Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density.
      11.   Tree Lined Streets: Tree lined street sections for all streets
(internal and periphery) are desirable to provide shade for sidewalks
(encourage walking) and to reduce solar heat gain on streets and buildings. To
qualify for this density bonus, all streets within the development, on both
sides of the streets, shall have a landscape strip between the curb and
sidewalk, planted with shade trees at forty foot (40') spacing or less. The
shade trees shall be from twenty four inch (24") box containers with a minimum
caliper of one and one-half inch (11/2") (1 inch above grade). Smaller trees
may be interplanted where overhead obstructions (power lines, etc.) may result
in problems that could be caused by the taller varieties. However, the sizes of
the trees at planting are to remain the same. A list of approved tree species
and landscaping guidelines are available in the community development
department. As approved by the city, trees may be grouped and/or staggered as
long as the average spacing of forty feet (40') is maintained.
Credit:    Twenty five percent (25%) increase in density.
      12.   Miscellaneous Public Benefits: Other types of open space benefits,
such as school sites, recreation centers, libraries, fire stations, the pooling
of adjoining properties for regional detention basins, regional parks or other
public benefits, etc., may also be explored for inclusion into bonus density
credits. These facilities will have to incorporate a degree of open space in
their design, and the design will have to be approved by the city, with the
density bonus credit determined during the project's evaluation. (Ord. 2005-40,
11-14-2005)
9-8A-8: DETACHED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (DADU):
   A.   Purpose and Intent:
      1.   The purpose and intent of detached accessory dwelling units (DADU)
is to provide additional housing for the owners of qualifying single family

single-family residence; the property owner shall record against the deed to
the subject property, a deed restriction, in a form provided by the city, and
will contain the following language:
“A permit for an accessory dwelling was issued to ________________, the current
owner of this property located at ______________________. The Owner shall
strictly adhere to the prohibition of the use of the accessory dwelling as a
nightly, short-term or vacation rental.”
      2.   Proof that such a deed restriction has been recorded shall be
provided to the Community Development Director prior to the issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy for the accessory dwelling unit.
   D.   Penalty: Any person, firm or corporation, whether as principal, agent,
employee or otherwise, violating or causing or permitting the violation of the
provision of this section, shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor, subject to
penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. Any such person, firm or corporation shall be deemed to be
guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during which any portion of
any violation of this ordinance is committed, continues or is permitted by such
person, firm or corporation. (Ord. 2019-25, 12-11-2019; amd. Ord. 2022-42, 7-
27-2022; Ord. 2023-21, 5-24-2023; Ord. 2024-25, 11-13-2024)
9-8A-9: INTERNAL ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (IADU):
   A.   Purpose and Intent:
      1.   The purpose and intent of the internal accessory dwelling unit
(IADU) is to provide for additional and affordable housing units located in
residential zoning districts within the city.
      2.   An internal accessory dwelling unit is defined as a separate
dwelling unit located entirely within a primary dwelling or within the
footprint of a primary dwelling at the time the IADU is created in association
with an owner-occupied single family detached dwelling on residentially zoned
property, that is clearly incidental and accessory to the primary dwelling on
the property. In addition to the standards described in this section, internal
accessory dwelling units must adhere to the standards described in state code.
      3.   A primary dwelling is defined as a single-family detached dwelling
that is occupied as the primary residence of the owner of record.
   B.   Permitted Zones: An internal accessory dwelling unit is a permitted use
in all residential zones, subject to the standards set forth in this section.
   C.   General Standards: The following standards shall be adhered to for all
internal accessory dwelling units:
      1.   Only one (1) internal accessory dwelling unit may exist on any
qualifying residentially zoned lot.
      2.   The proposed property location for an internal accessory dwelling
unit shall be a residential zoned lot that is a minimum of six thousand (6,000)
square feet (or greater) in size.
      3.   The lot where the internal accessory dwelling unit is located must
maintain the single-family appearance and character of the neighborhood.
Internal accessory dwelling units shall be compatible in design and appearance
with the primary dwelling on the property and shall not be located in detached
structures connected only by a roofed passage connecting two separate
buildings, such as a breezeway. Exterior doors to the internal accessory
dwelling units shall be located on the primary dwelling so as to avoid the
street-appearance of multiple unit entry doors on the primary dwelling’s
street-frontage.
      4.   The owner of the property must occupy the primary dwelling on the
property.
      5.   Internal accessory dwelling units shall meet all applicable Health,
Fire and Building Codes.
      6.   The internal accessory dwelling unit must contain complete cooking
and bathroom facilities that are separate from the facilities located in the
primary dwelling.
         a.   The cooking facility must contain:
            (1)   A sink and water faucet;
            (2)   Capacity for food refrigeration; and
            (3)   A commercially-manufactured appliance, such as a stove-top,

dwelling unit, the property owner must provide the required off-street parking
spaces somewhere on the property in a manner that complies with all standards
found within this Title.
      10.   Internal accessory dwelling units are not permitted within a
“mobile home” as said definition is adopted by Utah Code 57-16-3, and as
amended.
      11.   If rented, an internal accessory dwelling unit must be rented for a
minimum of thirty-one (31) days or longer.
      12.   Under no circumstances, shall internal accessory dwelling units be
used for nightly, short-term or vacation rental purposes. Rental periods of
thirty (30) days or less are prohibited in an IADU.
      13.   A city license for the renting of the internal accessory dwelling
unit is required.
   C.   Required Deed Restriction:

The purpose of the downtown mixed use zone is to provide appropriate locations
for the development and operation of a variety of uses in the downtown area
that will be pedestrian oriented by fronting buildings adjacent to the
sidewalks and providing parking at the rear of buildings. The design for new
development and the remodeling of existing development is to be of a
traditional nature by utilizing the ground level of buildings for predominantly
retail, restaurant and service businesses and utilizing the upper levels of
buildings for predominantly professional offices and residential units with
medium high densities. (Ord. 2009-14, 10-14-2009)

9-10D-3: SITE DESIGN REGULATIONS:
   A.   Downtown Mixed Use Design Guidelines: The design of all new development
and the external expansion of existing development, not including the internal
expansion of existing uses, including nonconforming uses but only if allowed
under chapter 15 of this title, are subject to the Washington City downtown
mixed use design guidelines. To get a basic idea of what the design guidelines
entail, a very small sample of them are described below to help in the
development planning process:
      1.   Two-Story Appearance For Single-Story Building: Where a single-story
building is to be developed it shall be designed to have a two-story appearance
from all views. This will prevent three-story buildings from overpowering the
single-story buildings and will provide no more than one-story transition
between buildings.
      2.   Uses Assigned To Levels In A Building: Retail, restaurant and
service businesses are to be placed on the ground level of buildings that front
Telegraph Street, and professional offices and residential units are to be
placed on the upper levels of buildings that front Telegraph Street. For
buildings that front the streets perpendicular to Telegraph Street, retail,
restaurant and service businesses, as well as professional offices, may occupy
any level of a building. Residential units are restricted to the upper levels
of buildings that front the streets perpendicular to Telegraph Street.
      3.   Sidewalk In Front Yard Setback: In addition to the public right of
way sidewalk, a minimum five foot (5') wide sidewalk shall be installed within
the front yard setback adjacent to the public right of way.
      4.   Parking: All on site parking shall be at the rear of the building(s)
as viewed from the street upon which the building fronts, but in any event,
always as viewed from Telegraph Street. Parking areas shall be provided for
motorcycles and bicycles. Except for parking spaces reserved for the disabled,
parking spaces shall not be reserved nor be advertised as parking for a
particular building, business, tenant or use.
      5.   Reciprocal Access Drives: Reciprocal access drives are required to
link adjacent properties from the side streets perpendicular to Telegraph
Street. This will provide access to all properties within a block while
avoiding the need for driveways on Telegraph Street.
      6.   Prohibition Of Exterior Vending Machines And Newspaper Racks:
Exterior vending machines and newspaper racks are prohibited in the DM zone.
(Ord. 2009-14, 10-14-2009)

development of land within our community by providing greater flexibility in
the placement of buildings and structures on the land, the consolidation and
preservation of community-valued view corridors, and the clustering of
commercial units. Proposed developments should be designed to maximize the
integration of improvements into the natural and proposed landscape, thereby
minimizing the visual impact on both view corridors/viewsheds as well as from
property to property within the community. These PUD provisions are intended to
create more attractive and desirable environments within the commercial areas
of the City. (Ord. 2018-03, 1-10-2018)

9-11-3: SITE DESIGN REGULATIONS:
All uses are subject to the following site design regulations and the chapters
of this code governing land use supplementary and qualifying regulations, off
street parking requirements, and any affected overlay zone:
   A.   Distance To Specific Zone Boundary: Notwithstanding the setback
requirements of section
9-11-5 of this chapter, no building or buildings which house processing or
assembly activities that are fully contained within said buildings shall be
located less than fifty feet (50') from any residential or agricultural zone
boundary.
   B.   Storage; Fencing: In the I-1 and I-2 zones, all storage, except
passenger vehicles in running order, shall be stored within an enclosed
building or within an enclosure surrounded by a solid decorative fence or wall
(chainlink fencing with slats is not considered a solid fence or wall for the
purposes set forth in this chapter) of not less than six feet (6') in height
when adjacent to an agricultural or residential zone boundary. The materials
and colors of the fence or wall shall be compatible with their associated
buildings. Under conditional use permit review, the city shall determine if a
solid fence or wall is required when adjacent to any other zone boundary. Also,
no material or merchandise shall be stored at a height to exceed eighteen feet
(18') unless approved by the city with a conditional use permit. All uses which
will maintain outdoor storage of any materials shall keep such materials in an
orderly manner and said products shall not project above the fence or wall
within twenty feet (20') from any residential or agricultural zone boundary. In
order to protect public safety, if there are any other codes, ordinances, laws
or other applicable regulations requiring greater separation of stored
materials or processes from adjoining uses, the greater distance of required
setback shall prevail. If products stored exceed six feet (6') in height, those
products shall be set back from an agricultural or residential zone boundary
according to the following chart:
   I-1 Zone And I-2 Zone Storage Setback Requirements
   When Adjacent To Agricultural Or Residential Zone Boundaries
   C.   Outdoor Activities: In the I-1 and I-2 zones, notwithstanding the
setback requirements of section
9-11-5 of this chapter, no outdoor assembly, construction, repair or
manufacturing activities shall be located less than fifty feet (50') from any
agricultural or residential zone boundary.
   D.   Storage And Activities In BP Zone: In the BP zone, storage, assembly,
construction, repair or manufacturing activities must take place within an
enclosed building. Outdoor storage and activities of this nature are
prohibited.
   E.   Fence Required When: Where any I-1, I-2 or BP zone adjoins any
agricultural or residential zone boundary, there shall be provided and
maintained along such property line a solid decorative fence or wall of not
less than six feet (6') in height. The materials and colors of the fence or
wall shall be compatible with their associated buildings.
   F.   Parking Area Lighting: All outside parking areas shall be lighted
during evening business hours. All lights shall be designed to direct light
away from adjacent properties.
   G.   Screening: Except for the I-2 zone, loading dock areas shall be
screened from public view with a solid decorative fence or wall of sufficient
height to provide the required screening. In the I-1, I-2 and BP zones, refuse
collection areas shall be screened from public view with a solid decorative
fence or wall of sufficient height to provide the required screening. The
materials and colors of the fence or wall shall be compatible with their
associated buildings. (Ord. 2007-05, 2-28-2007)
9-11-4: HEIGHT REGULATIONS:
No building or structure shall be erected to a height greater than forty-five
feet (45'), unless otherwise approved by the city council. (Ord. 2007-05, 2-28-

if approved by the city with a conditional use permit, the interior side yard
and rear yard setbacks may be reduced or eliminated.
(Ord. 2007-05, 2-28-2007)
9-11-6: LANDSCAPING AND BUILDING ELEVATION REGULATIONS:
   A.   Plans shall include provisions for the installation and maintenance of
landscaping as cited in this section and in the chapters of this code governing
land use supplementary and qualifying regulations, off street parking
requirements, and any affected overlay zone. In the I-1 and I-2 zones, a
minimum ten foot (10') wide landscape strip shall be installed along all street
frontages. Where a wall is installed along a street frontage, the landscape
strip shall be increased to a minimum of thirty feet (30'). In the BP zone, a
minimum thirty foot (30') wide landscape strip shall be installed along all

itself), columns and beams to help visually segment the walls. A variation in
materials, colors, textures and rooflines that convey a sense of order is
encouraged. Narrow parapet sections that extend beyond the main roofline and
the adjoining parapet sections for the purpose of focusing on an entrance or
other portion of a building shall be topped with a roof section that extends
back over the main roof of the building. (Ord. 2007-05, 2-28-2007)
CHAPTER 12
OVERLAY ZONES
ARTICLE A. HILLSIDE PROTECTION OVERLAY (HP) ZONE
SECTION:
9-12A-1: Purpose And Intent
9-12A-2: Applicability
9-12A-3: Application Procedure
9-12A-4: Development Standards
9-12A-5: Hillside Review Board
9-12A-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the hillside protection overlay (HP) zone is to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents while
protecting and preserving significant scenic resources for the long term
benefit of Washington City as a whole. This is facilitated by establishing a
hillside review board (HRB) as a recommending body to staff, the planning
commission and the city council. The HRB will review proposed projects in the
HP zone based on this article. Additionally, the purpose of this HP zone is to
further the goals and policies of the general plan in relation to land use,
densities, open space and community image.
   B.   Intent: The standards set forth herein are intended to achieve the
following objectives:
      1.   Minimize adverse soil and slope instability; decrease the potential
for erosion; and prohibit activities and uses which would result in the
degradation of fragile soils and steep slopes.
      2.   Protect and preserve the visual resources which are of significant
value to the community. Such resources include, but are not limited to, major
hillsides, hilltops, ridges and ridgelines, knolls, mesas, cuestas and
escarpments, boulder outcroppings and large boulders, canyons and natural
drainage areas, and other areas of historical or visual significance. Retain
the integrity of significant on site and off site views to or from these
resources.
      3.   Minimize the adverse effects of grading and cut and fill operations;
avoid highly visible scarring of hillsides; and protect natural vegetation,
sensitive hydrologic features, and visually prominent landforms.
      4.   Discourage mass grading and terracing of large pads but permit
flexibility for reasonable development practices as appropriate.
      5.   Establish a hillside development process that requires applicants to
select suitable development sites on their property through the use of slope
calculations, maximum land holding capacity, or development agreements to
determine the appropriate density, intensity, design and location of structures
and improvements.
      6.   Provide hillside development standards that maximize the positive
impacts of site sensitive design, grading, landscape architecture and building
architecture that will protect the inherent scenic value in the proposed
projects subject to this article.
      7.   Permit the flexibility to modify or remove relatively small
topographic features which have slopes distinctly different from surrounding
property in order to facilitate reasonably efficient development in a
particular area. The exclusion of such features or areas shall not be contrary
to the overall purpose of this article.
      8.   Encourage the appropriate location, design and development of
proposed projects which provide enhanced human enjoyment, while protecting
people and property from hazardous conditions, including rockfalls, rolling
boulders, unstable slopes, landslides, mudslides, and erosion.
      9.   Minimize the impacts of development to the surrounding natural
environment by controlling the location, intensity, pattern, design,
construction techniques, and materials of development. (Ord. 2008-23, 6-11-
2008)
9-12A-2: APPLICABILITY:
The standards and procedures established by this article shall apply to all
lands lying within the HP zone as delineated in exhibit A attached to the
ordinance codified herein. In addition, all properties seeking annexation or
preapproval of projects pending annexation to the city will be evaluated
according to the standards and procedures outlined in this article.
   A.   Hillside Protection Overlay (HP) Zone: The HP zone is delineated in the
hillside protection overlay (HP) zone exhibit A attached to the ordinance
codified herein. The HP zone established by this article shall overlay the
existing zoning classifications listed in this title. Except for the clustering
provisions that are a part of this article, in cases of conflict between the
provisions of this article and other established regulations, the most
restrictive provisions shall apply. The exact location of the HP zone boundary
may be refined jointly by the city and the applicant as detailed topographical
information is closely examined at the time of application review and
processing. The precise location of the HP zone boundary shall remain
consistent with the intent of this article, especially in regard to the
protection of key natural features and edge conditions.
   B.   Exemptions From HP Zone Requirements: The following actions and
activities are exempt from the application procedure of this article. However,
while these actions are exempt from specific requirements, the development
standards necessary to accomplish the purpose and intent of this article shall
be met (e.g., the mitigation of disturbed areas that are not planned for
development in the foreseeable future).
      1.   Construction or minor excavation that does not require a grading
permit or a building permit. However, development plans shall be submitted to
the community development department for city review to determine possible
mitigation requirements prior to any actions or activities taking place.
      2.   The construction and installation (trenching, utility construction
and backfilling) of underground utility systems.
      3.   The regrading of existing lots for landscape installation provided
such regraded area is within the buildable area of the development.
      4.   Pool/spa construction that does not involve the construction of any
retaining walls over four feet (4') in height, whether or not such retaining
walls are part of the pool structure.
      5.   Additions to existing structures and/or construction of accessory
structures within the buildable area of a lot unless a grading permit for
establishment of same is required.
      6.   Any project that has received final city approval prior to the
effective date of this article, provided that such permit or approval has not
expired, is not otherwise revoked, and is in compliance with the HP zone
requirements that this article supersedes.
      7.   The construction of a public street identified in the Washington
City general plan and/or transportation master plan that is not part of any
overall development project (e.g., a street proposed primarily for improved
circulation within the city and not to provide access to any particular parcel
or development).
   C.   Hillside Classification Standards: Each slope category range delineates
the relative suitability of land for development.
      1.   Categories: The slope categories are described as follows:
         a.   0 percent to 20 percent; flat to gently rolling land: Development
with grading is permitted in this slope category. Padded building sites are
permitted; however, on slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), techniques
such as contour grading, split level architectural prototypes where feasible,
or grading for the structure pad only, shall be used to reduce cut and fill.
         b.   20.01 percent to 25 percent; moderate hillside: Special hillside
architectural and design techniques that minimize grading and harmonize with
the built and natural environments are required in this slope category.
Architectural prototypes and infrastructure elements are expected to complement
the natural landform by using techniques required herein. Impact of streets and
trails is to be minimized by following natural contours where practicable.
         c.   25.01 percent to 30 percent; hillside: Development within this
slope category shall be limited to slopes where it can be demonstrated that
safety, environmental, and aesthetic impacts can be minimized. The use of
planning and design techniques such as larger lots, variable setbacks, and
appropriate building structural techniques (e.g., stepped slabs, pole
foundations, etc.) are expected. Structures shall blend with the natural
environment through their shape, materials, and colors. Impact of streets and
trails are to be minimized by following natural contours where practicable.
         d.   30.01 percent to 40 percent; steep hillside: This is a sensitive
slope condition and development is prohibited unless a specific exception is
allowed by the city as outlined in this article.
         e.   Greater than 40 percent; mountainous: This is a severe slope
condition and development is prohibited unless a specific exception is allowed
by the city as outlined in this article.
      2.   Restrictions And Incentives: Both restrictions on and incentives for
potential development apply to the HP zone in order to preserve the character
of the natural terrain as much as possible. The following provisions shall be
applied to development within the HP zone:
   SLOPE, MAXIMUM DENSITY, AND REQUIRED OPEN SPACE

Notes:
1.   While the maximum number of dwelling units allowed may be less than
allowed by the underlying zoning designation, the number of dwelling units
allowed in each slope category shall not exceed the maximum number of dwelling
units allowed by the underlying zone. (See notes 3 and 4 of this table for
exceptions.)
2.   Allowed dwelling units transferred to a lower slope category are entitled
to a steep slope protection bonus (see subsection D of this section).
3.   Density credits are equivalent to dwelling units and are valid only when
transferred to an area within a slope category of 30 percent or less.
Transferred density credits may also be entitled to a steep slope protection
bonus (see subsection D of this section). Transferred density credits are
permitted in addition to the maximum number of allowed dwelling units in the
receiving slope category.
4.   A percentage of the total land area in some slope categories as indicated
shall be dedicated as permanent undisturbed open space, and the allowed
development and dwelling units (if any) shall be clustered on the remaining
land area (unless a specific exception is allowed by the city as outlined in
this article). The percentage of open space area required is based on the
overall development area rather than per lot. Any previously disturbed areas
that are to be classified as permanent open space shall be reclaimed to blend
with the surrounding terrain and native vegetation.
5.   Except for the reclamation of previously disturbed hillsides, hillside
slopes calculated to be greater than 30 percent shall not be disturbed (unless
a specific exception is allowed by the city as outlined in this article) and
shall be designated on site plans and subdivision plats as permanent
undisturbed open space. Areas with slopes greater than 40 percent shall not be
included in the calculations for determining open space for a zoning district
that has an open space requirement; however, dedicated open space areas with
slopes of 40 percent or less may be counted toward the open space requirement.
      3.   Exceptions To Slope Category Limitations: Large contiguous land
areas of 30.01 percent plus slopes that comprise prominent landforms and
ridgeline features that express the significant or unique character of a
property shall not be disturbed. However, other land areas of 30.01 percent
plus slopes may be disturbed or significantly altered if the applicant
demonstrates to the city general compliance with the purpose and intent of this
article regarding the preservation of prominent hillside and ridgeline
features. This compliance shall be demonstrated in a slope analysis exhibit and
through other supporting images or data provided by the applicant (see
subsection 9-12A-3D of this article). Examples of such landforms may include,
but are not limited to, existing manmade slopes, singular or isolated
topographic features, the side slopes of small washes, and minor rock
outcroppings that are not a part of prominent hilltops or ridgelines.
   D.   Clustering And Steep Slope Protection Bonus For Residential Zones: Each
allowed dwelling unit that is transferred from a higher slope category to a
location within a lower slope category land area (based on the slope analysis
exhibit outlined in this article) is entitled to a steep slope protection
dwelling unit bonus. This encourages the clustering of dwelling units, the
preservation of open space and the protection of steep slopes and prominent
ridgelines. The density transfer shall be indicated on a preliminary plat.
Transferred density credits are also entitled to any steep slope protection
bonus as outlined below. The steep slope protection bonus is as follows:
   STEEP SLOPE PROTECTION BONUS DWELLING UNITS
Slope Category To Slope Bonus Dwelling Unit Per   Total Dwelling Unit Including
Category Transfer       Dwelling Unit Transferred Each Dwelling Unit
                                                  Transferred

      1.   Density transfers may occur without a zone change to the receiving
parcel even though the resulting lot sizes or density may exceed the limits of
the underlying zone, provided that the use in the receiving parcel is
consistent with the receiving parcel's zoning.
      2.   Development standards such as minimum lot size, lot width and
setbacks for structures in the receiving parcel's underlying zone may allow
flexibility for the clustering of units in the HP zone. The guiding principle
for allowing such development standards to be less than the minimum
requirements in the receiving parcel's underlying zone is that the overall
development is designed to leave as much of the natural terrain in its
undisturbed condition as possible. However, in some cases and certain locations
development standards for structures may need to be greater than the minimum
standards in order to uphold safety and general welfare standards or to
preserve a prominent or unique feature of the natural terrain. The use of unit
clustering and the flexibility of these standards are to be shown on the
conceptual plan, and setbacks and maximum disturbance areas shall be listed and
shown on the approved site plans and subdivision plats.
      3.   For developments that use the steep slope protection bonus and
clustering provisions outlined herein, a development agreement between the city
and the developer shall be executed outlining the provisions upon which the
development was approved, including the responsibility for maintaining
permanent open space. (Ord. 2008-23, 6-11-2008)

works departments shall have the right to order a halt to construction of any
improvements within an HP zone where, in the officer's discretion, there exists
a condition which violates, or threatens to violate, any provisions of this
article. Such suspension of construction activities shall continue until the
city officer is satisfied that measures have been implemented for substantial
compliance with this article. The developer may appeal to the board of
adjustment. The city may enter legal proceedings to require any person who
violates this article to fund and return a site to the condition found prior to
any disturbance, with a city official to determine when this natural state has
been achieved, or to set specific requirements necessary to achieve the natural
and restored state. Legal proceedings may also seek to impose and collect a
fine in order to recover staff costs incurred through addressing any violation
of this section. (Ord. 2008-23, 6-11-2008)
9-12A-4: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All proposed development and improvements within the HP zone are subject to the
following required development standards. These standards are intended to
provide a framework for development that is sensitive to the unique
characteristics of hillside properties. Their purpose is not to discourage
proposals for innovative or alternative methods of design in a hillside area;
innovation is encouraged as long as the end result is one which respects
significant landform features and is consistent with the purposes expressed in
this article and in the goals and objectives of the Washington City general
plan.
   A.   Disturbance Limitations: The following criteria shall be applied in
establishing the limits of disturbance for a site:
      1.   Adverse visual impacts shall be minimized as much as possible. The
screening of cuts and fills, and the visual protection of prominent ridgelines,
rock outcroppings, scenic views, and as much of the natural terrain as
practicable is required.
      2.   Disturbed slopes shall be treated to minimize erosion, and natural
drainageways shall be protected as much as possible.
      3.   The clearing of trees, shrubs and other native vegetation shall be
limited to: the approved locations for streets, driveways and easements; the
approved locations for building pads for structures, main buildings and
accessory structures; and the minimum distance between structures and
surrounding vegetation for established fire prevention and safety standards or
recommendations.
      4.   Significant trees, shrubs and other native vegetation shall be
preserved in the design of the development. Significant vegetation is to be
identified on a map with the application submittals and city staff will review
the submittals and visit the site to determine the significance of existing
vegetation.
      5.   The limits of disturbance may be noncontiguous as long as the
significant features of the natural terrain are being preserved.
      6.   All topsoil from any disturbed portion of the site shall be
preserved and utilized in revegetation areas. The soil in the upper portion of
fill areas shall be of a sufficient quality to support native plant growth.
      7.   The surface coverage of all main and accessory structures shall not
exceed sixty percent (60%) of the gross lot or parcel area for detached
dwellings and seventy percent (70%) of the gross lot or parcel area for
attached dwellings.
      8.   The maximum limits of disturbance shall be identified on each lot or
parcel of the approved site plans and subdivision plats and shall include all
graded, excavated, and filled areas, the areas occupied by main and accessory
structures, hard surface areas that include driveways, walkways, patios and
parking areas, and all other areas of disturbance or nonnative vegetation.
   B.   Grading Design: Grading for all developments shall be designed to blend
with the contours of the adjacent natural terrain.
      1.   Limits Of Grading: No grading, cutting, filling, excavating,
benching or terracing of any proposed lot or parcel shall go beyond the maximum
limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel as provided herein.
      2.   Cuts And Fills: All cuts and fills shall be minimized as much as
practicable and shall be included within the maximum limits of disturbance for
each lot or parcel. All cut and fill areas shall be recontoured to the natural,
varied contours of the surrounding terrain with a maximum slope transition back
to the natural grade no greater than two to one (2:1). Slope ratios greater
than two to one (2:1) are prohibited except for approved cuts into solid rock
only. Any such proposed cut into rock shall be reviewed by the HRB for
appropriateness, suitability, and visual impact in order to grant approval if
warranted. For approved cuts into solid rock, the slope may be as steep as one-
half to one (1/2:1) if recommended by a Utah licensed professional engineer who
is trained and experienced in the practice of geotechnical engineering and if
the visual impact of the cut can be adequately mitigated. All areas of cut and
fill shall be protected from erosion during the period of construction and
shall be permanently planted or otherwise protected from erosion within twenty
(20) days of the completion of grading and excavation as identified by the
approved landscape plan.
Where cut or fill conditions are created, slopes shall be varied where feasible
rather than left at a constant angle which may be unstable or create an
unnatural, rigid, engineered appearance.
      3.   Cuts And Fills Visual Mitigation: The visual impact of cuts and
fills shall be mitigated by methods approved by the city. This mitigation may
include, but is not limited to, the placement of buildings in front of the cuts
and/or the placement of retaining walls designed to blend with the surrounding
terrain to stabilize the cut. Mitigation shall predominantly be contour grading
along with plantings as identified on the approved landscape plan that will
stabilize the cut or fill slope and blend with the surrounding vegetation. The
use of retaining walls is to be as limited in scope and height as feasible to
ensure the visual predominance of vegetation. Contour grading techniques shall
be used to provide a natural appearing variety of slope transitions, slope
percentage and slope direction in a three-dimensional, undulating pattern
similar to existing, adjacent terrain.
         a.   Hard edges left by cut and fill operations shall be given a
rounded appearance that closely resembles the natural contours of the land.
         b.   Manmade slopes adjacent to roadways shall be softened where
feasible by sufficient berms, contour grading, and/or landscaping to create
visually interesting and pleasing streetscapes.
      4.   Street And Driveway Alignment: Street alignments shall run generally
parallel along the contours of the natural terrain as much as practicable.
Short sections of streets that run perpendicular to natural contours and serve
the purpose of connecting main parallel sections of streets are permitted and
shall follow the natural curves of drainageways where practicable. Streets
shall not greatly alter the physical and visual character of a hillside by
creating large notches in ridgelines or by defining wide straight alignments.
Contour grading techniques shall be employed on all streets and associated cut
and fill areas to minimize any adverse impacts. Reduced width road sections,
split road sections, and split parking bays are potential design techniques to
employ in the layout of hillside streets to reduce grading.
The portions of driveways that run perpendicular to natural contours and serve
the purpose of accessing building lots and parcels shall be as short as
practicable. Driveways that serve more than one parcel are permitted as a
method of reducing unnecessary grading, paving and site disturbance. If lots
and parcels will be sharing driveways, cross use easements shall be recorded
with the subdivision.
      5.   Open Space Trails: Where permitted, trails through open space shall
be located such that cuts and fills are minimized and visual character is
preserved. Where cuts and fills are required, cut conditions uphill from the
trail typically have less of an overall visual impact than an exposed downhill
fill area.
      6.   Structure Location: Design of building sites shall be sensitive to
the natural terrain. Structures shall be located in such a way as to minimize
grading and to preserve natural features. Careful consideration shall be given
to the general orientation of the slope when locating structures.
      7.   Building Sites: On each building site, careful consideration shall
be given to the cut and fill conditions such that a balance is achieved where
feasible and consistent with the intent of this article to minimize the visual
impact of grading. Different slope conditions call for corresponding typical
cut and fill solutions such that the structure fits well into the topography as
illustrated below. Impacts to natural drainageways shall be avoided where
possible.
   C.   Viewshed Protection: To minimize the adverse visual impacts that
development may potentially have on prominent ridgelines, mesas, and other site
features, the following setbacks shall apply:
      1.   Prominent Ridgeline And Natural Feature Edge Condition: The minimum
setback from the edge or top of slope of a prominent ridgeline, plateau or mesa
is fifty feet (50') for one story structures and sight obscuring privacy fences
and walls unless a greater setback is recommended in the geotechnical report.
The minimum setback from the edge or top of slope of a prominent ridgeline,
plateau or mesa is one hundred feet (100') for structures or parts of
structures with one and one-half (11/2) or more stories unless a greater
setback is recommended in the geotechnical report. A greater setback may also
be required by the underlying zoning district.
      2.   Cuestas: The minimum setback from a prominent ridgeline of a cuesta
is the distance necessary to prevent the elevation of the extreme tops of all
structures on the cuesta from exceeding the elevation of the ridgeline or crest
of the cuesta, unless a greater setback is recommended in the geotechnical
report. A greater setback may also be required by the underlying zoning
district.
      3.   Manmade Slopes: The minimum setback from the edge or top of slope of
a manmade slope (which may include a retaining wall) twenty feet (20') or more
in height is fifteen feet (15') for one story structures and sight obscuring
privacy fences and walls unless a greater setback is recommended in the
geotechnical report. The minimum setback from the edge or top of slope of a
manmade slope (which may include a retaining wall) twenty feet (20') or more in
height is twenty five feet (25') for structures or parts of structures with one
and one-half (11/2) or more stories unless a greater setback is recommended in
the geotechnical report. A greater setback may also be required by the
underlying zoning district.
   D.   Architectural Standards: The purpose of establishing architectural
design standards in the HP zone is to ensure quality development that blends
with the hillside environment and to create neighborhoods that display
harmonious and complementary architectural styles. To achieve hillside
compatible development, the city recognizes the importance of having
architectural design that incorporates rooflines and other building elements
that reflect the naturally occurring ridgeline silhouettes and topographical
variations.
      1.   Building Orientation: A variety of building and lot orientations
shall be provided in order to encourage development suitable with the hillside
character of the site.
         a.   Structures shall be designed so the slope angle of the roof pitch
is generally less than or equal to the angle of the natural hillside or manmade
slope.
         b.   Site planning shall emphasize the preservation of views to
prominent visual features such as ridgelines. This includes building
orientation to allow view opportunities and lot development on the least
sensitive portions of the site to preserve landforms, vegetation and
topographical features.
         c.   Hillside adaptive architecture shall be terraced to follow the
contours of the slope. Exterior structural supports and undersides of floors
and decks not enclosed by walls are discouraged but may be permitted with fire
safety and architectural considerations adequately addressed to the
satisfaction of the city individual or body designated to grant approval.
      2.   Building Style: The use of hillside adaptive architecture as needed
shall be incorporated into the design of individual lots in areas within the HP
zone. Step building foundations may be required to minimize grading.
         a.   Architectural styles shall be compatible with the hillside
character, topography, and theme of the community.
         b.   A variety of roof orientations and types which emphasize roof
pitches reflecting the overall slope of the hillside shall be incorporated into
the design of the development.
         c.   Enhanced architectural elevations where the front, rear or side
of units face public view is required. The architecture of hilltop units will
be restricted to avoid massive walls and monotonous patterns of building
silhouettes.
         d.   The dimensions of a building, measured in the direction of the
slope, shall be minimized in order to limit the amount of cut and fill and to
better incorporate the structure to the natural terrain.
         e.   Terraced decks shall not be built on slopes which are a part of a
project's common area controlled by a homeowners' or property owners'
association or landscape maintenance district.
         f.   Buildings may be clustered to respect and adapt to the existing
topography. Flexible site techniques including varying the position of the
structures and varying the sizes of lots shall be used as necessary to preserve
the character of the hillside setting.
      3.   Architectural Treatments: Architectural treatments on all exterior
walls of any building shall be designed to avoid monotonous or continuous
facades. One continuous vertical or horizontal plane on the front and rear
facade of any building is not permitted. Architectural features and details
shall be incorporated in all exterior walls of the building, including the rear
and sides of the building. Buildings shall utilize wall articulation (i.e.,
insets, pop outs, etc.) and roof orientation as a means to break up the
massing.
         a.   The form, mass and profile of the individual buildings and
architectural features shall be designed to blend with the natural terrain and
preserve the character of the natural slope. The use of large gable ends on
downhill elevations shall be avoided. The predominant roof slope shall be
oriented in the same general direction as the natural slope.
         b.   Large roof overhangs and cantilevers on downhill elevations shall
be avoided to reduce the massive appearance from below.
      4.   Finish Materials, Color, And Reflectivity: Building materials and
colors shall be compatible with the natural setting. The color, material and
texture palette shall be reinforced with compatible landscaping. The light
reflective value (LRV) of materials used on all exterior walls and roof areas
shall be similar to the LRV of the surrounding terrain. This typically shall be
between 7 (darkest value of shaded vegetation) and 38 (approximate value of the
red sandstone in the area). Generally, the more visible the structure, the
lower its LRV shall typically be. The building material colors and their LRVs
shall be submitted with the final application.
      5.   Fencing And Privacy Walls: All fences and privacy walls adjacent to
or clearly visible from public roads or parks shall be constructed of
decorative masonry or other approved materials which have a natural appearance
and shall be a color that blends with the surrounding environment and is
complementary to the landscape. The applicant shall present illustrations and
descriptions of fencing and wall materials as required by this section.
All walls and fences which are adjacent to or visible from public roads shall
be set back from the right of way a minimum of six feet (6') (or greater where
cited elsewhere in this code) and landscaped on the street side of the wall or
fence. Additionally, walls and fences not exceeding six feet (6') in height are
permitted adjacent to structures in order to provide a private outdoor area. A
minimum flat area from top or toe of slope of three feet (3') or more as
required by the adopted building codes of the city shall be maintained to face
of wall on common area maintenance slopes with slope heights of thirty feet
(30') or greater.
   E.   Landscape Design Standards:
      1.   Landscape materials and stabilization of graded slopes shall be
designed to be compatible with surrounding natural vegetation.
         a.   Plant Material: Plant material shall be selected according to
compatible climatic, soil and ecological characteristics of the region.
         b.   Slope And Landscape Maintenance: Homeowners' or property owners'
associations and assessment districts or other acceptable legal entities are
required to maintain common open space. All landscaped slopes not included
within a landscape maintenance district (LMD) shall be maintained by a
homeowners' association (HOA) or a property owners' association (POA) for the
permanent maintenance of landscaped slopes and other areas. An HOA/POA shall be
required to establish a maintenance district with responsibility for slope and
landscape maintenance should the HOA/POA disband.
      2.   All cut and fill slopes shall be planted and irrigated with an
automatic irrigation system as appropriate for selected plant material to blend
with the natural environment. The HOA/POA shall be responsible for monitoring
the irrigation to ensure the absence of irrigation caused erosion or areas of
overspray. All cut or fill slopes exceeding five feet (5') vertical height
shall be planted with adequate plant material to protect the slope against
erosion. Plants shall be planted in a quantity and distribution pattern
sufficient to replicate a healthy and vigorous desert landscape. All plants
shall be drought resistant or low water use in natural areas and shrubs shall
be a minimum one gallon size. All trees shall be a minimum five (5) gallon size
except street trees within rights of way where larger trees are required per
this code.
   F.   Retaining Walls: The purpose and intent of establishing development
standards for retaining walls is to ensure that the application of retaining
walls are aesthetically pleasing elements within the subject property and
limited in quantity throughout a development. The location of all retaining
walls, privacy walls and fences shall be identified along with their proposed
heights, materials and colors, and shown on the grading plan and concept plan.
All retaining walls, privacy walls and fences shall be located within the
maximum limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel.
      1.   General Standards:
         a.   The maximum length of any continuous retaining wall shall not be
more than two hundred (200) linear feet.
         b.   Retaining walls shall be used for the purpose of containing fill
material or for minimizing cut or fill slopes. The retaining wall may only
extend six inches (6") above the material it is retaining.
         c.   A retaining wall shall not be constructed in such a manner so as
to block or restrict vehicular access to a dedicated or implied dedicated
alley, accessway, pedestrian access, trail, sidewalk, easement, or right of
way.
         d.   All retaining walls and all privacy walls and fences surrounding
a development's perimeter shall be faced with stone or earth colored materials
complementary to the surrounding natural landscape.
         e.   Retaining walls shall follow the natural contours of the slope
where feasible. Curved walls that follow the natural contours are recommended
but not required.
         f.   All retaining walls as well as all freestanding walls and fences
shall comply with the adopted building codes of the city.
      2.   Height Standards:
         a.   No retaining wall for a cut or fill area shall exceed ten feet
(10') in height as measured from the immediately adjacent lowest natural or
finished grade to the top of wall unless it can be demonstrated in the overall
mitigation plan for cuts and fills that taller walls will not detract from the
surrounding terrain and there is a predominance of vegetation in the fill areas
as outlined above. Retaining walls shall not be stacked or terraced in any
manner that increases their combined height beyond ten feet (10'). If desired,
two (2) subwalls may be stacked or terraced to a maximum combined height of ten
feet (10'). A minimum separation of six feet (6') is required between subwalls
as measured from face of wall. The separation area between the sets of subwalls
shall be planted with low water use/low maintenance shrubs or other vegetation
as approved in the landscape plan. Trees are not to be planted in the zone
between subwalls unless separation is at least twenty feet (20'). This
vegetation will help reduce the apparent visual height of the wall or walls.
         b.   For purposes of this subsection, retaining walls are not
considered stacked or terraced if there is a minimum horizontal separation of
ten feet (10') between sets of retaining walls. With the minimum ten foot (10')
separation, each retaining wall set may be constructed to the maximum allowed
height; either the ten foot (10') height or the taller height demonstrated that
would not detract from the surrounding terrain. The separation area between the
sets of retaining walls shall be planted with low water use/low maintenance
shrubs or other vegetation as approved in the landscape plan. Trees are not to
be planted in the zone between terraced walls unless the distance between walls
is a minimum of twenty feet (20'). This vegetation will help reduce the
apparent visual height of the wall or walls.
         c.   Retaining walls may be constructed to varying heights throughout
a development.
            (1)   Retaining walls constructed in the side yard area of a lot
shall maintain a maximum retaining wall height of four feet (4'); provided that
such wall does not extend into a required front yard adjacent to a street.
            (2)   Retaining walls constructed in the rear yard area of a lot
shall maintain a maximum retaining wall height of eight feet (8').
            (3)   All planting areas between and adjacent to retaining walls
shall be provided with an automatic irrigation system suitable for low water
use vegetation. Such irrigation system shall be approved and inspected prior to
the construction of any wall.
            (4)   Where a retaining wall contains fill above the natural grade
and is located within a required setback yard, the height of the retaining wall
shall be considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence or
wall at that location. A nonview obscuring fence up to three and one-half feet
(3.5') in height may be erected at the top of the retaining wall for safety.
         d.   Retaining walls not exceeding six feet (6') in height are
permitted adjacent to structures in order to provide a private outdoor area.
   G.   Corrective Work: Nothing in this section shall prohibit the individual
or body designated to grant approval from authorizing grading deemed necessary
to correct previously disturbed natural areas or existing hazardous conditions
that are on site but not a part of the proposed development area and that are
brought to the city's attention. In such case, the applicant will investigate
possible alternatives with subsequent review by the individual or body
designated to grant approval. (Ord. 2008-23, 6-11-2008)

   B.   Advertising Signs: All advertising signs shall comply with the
provisions of chapter 18 of this title.
   C.   Landscaping Requirements:
      1.   A ten foot (10') landscape setback buffer is required along all
freeway frontages. The buffer shall contain, as a minimum, one 24-inch box
tree, with a minimum caliper of two inches (2") for every thirty feet (30') of
adjacent lot line. The trees may be clustered. The trees shall be a mix of both
deciduous and evergreen (evergreen to be 50 percent of total). Minimum tree
height shall be five feet (5') for conifers and seven feet (7') for deciduous.
      2.   Landscaping shall be used to help focus on entrances to buildings,
soften parking lots and loading areas, define edges of various land uses,
provide transitions between neighboring properties (buffering), and provide
screening for outdoor storage, loading and equipment areas.
      3.   Landscaping around the entire base of buildings is required to
soften the edge between parking lots and structures. This shall be accented at
entrances to provide focus.
      4.   Trees shall be located throughout parking lots and not simply at the
ends of parking aisles. In order to be considered within parking lots, trees
shall be located in planters that are bounded on at least three (3) sides by
parking area paving. Parking areas shall include one tree for every five (5)
parking spaces and shall be uniformly dispersed to provide shade. Trees shall
be a minimum size of fifteen (15) gallons (at least 1 inch in diameter) at
planting, and shall be of a species which shall reach a thirty foot (30') to
fifty foot (50') crown within fifteen (15) years.
      5.   Landscaping shall be protected from vehicular and pedestrian
encroachment by raised planting surfaces, depressed walls or the use of curbs.
      6.   Buildings shall not be located where their office portions directly
abut paved parking areas. A minimum five foot (5') landscape strip shall be
provided between parking areas and the office portions of buildings.
   D.   Building Setback: The minimum building setback from the freeway right
of way line shall not be less than the setback required by the underlying zone,
and in no case be less than ten feet (10').
   E.   Service Areas: Service areas, including storage, special equipment,
maintenance and loading areas, shall be screened with landscaping and
architectural elements. The purpose is to hide those areas from the freeway.
Loading docks and service areas shall be located on interior side yards and
concealed from public "freeway" view (side yard opposite the direction of
traffic). Utility equipment and communication devices located on the ground
shall be screened so that the site will appear free of such devices. Utility
lines for water, gas, sewage, electrical and communication shall be installed
underground.
   F.   Refuse Collection Areas: Refuse collection areas shall be visibly
screened with a solid perimeter wall using materials and colors compatible with
those of the adjacent structures. Refuse collection areas are to be located on
an interior building side yard and shall be roofed if the contents of the area
are visible from the freeway.
   G.   Facades:
      1.   Facades shall be designed to convey a sense of order through the
interplay of lights, shadow and texture. Facade articulation shall reinforce a
sense of quality and integrity.
      2.   Facades shall reflect the quality and the sense of order of the
underlying structure in a clear and consistent manner. Window panels shall be
differentiated and the percentage of window glass that is visible from the
freeway shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of a wall surface. Highly
reflective glass which could possibly impede a driver's visibility from the
freeway shall be prohibited unless properly screened.
   H.   Building Walls: The site development plan shall be prepared so that the
building walls viewed from I-15 are similar in design to the front of the
building. The front of the building, regardless of orientation toward I-15,
shall meet the design regulations cited elsewhere in this section.
   I.   Building Proportion And Elevation: A refinement of the building
proportions and building elevation details shall be carefully conceived to
achieve desired goals.
   J.   Recessed Wall Surfaces: Recessed or articulated wall surfaces, columns
and beams shall be used to help visually segment an otherwise massive exterior
wall surface.
   K.   Roof Mounted Mechanical Equipment: Roof mounted mechanical equipment
shall be screened on all sides. Any devices located on the structure shall be
properly screened to minimize visual impact. The color of these devices shall
be the same as the building color. (Ord. 2004-10, 5-12-2004)

9-12C-4: RECLAMATION PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
All applications for extractive use sites must submit a reclamation plan to the
planning commission, indicating how the site will be reclaimed upon completion
of mining activities to allow for the productive and compatible reuse of the
site, as well as the time frame in which reclamation activities will occur. The
plan will be designed to eliminate waste heaps, prevent shallow stagnant small
bodies of water, small unusable remnants of land, eroding and barren slopes
normally associated with open pit operations. This may be modified by the
planning commission when remaining pits are to be used to provide storm water
detention facilities, in accordance with approved storm water retention plans.
   A.   Concurrent Reclamation: The reclamation or rehabilitation of excavation
sites with a projected life of more than one year shall be carried out
simultaneously with the excavation of the mineral resource. Excavation shall be
planned so as to progressively develop the proposed final land forms by grading
and stockpiling overburden materials in areas designated for future land forms
within the approved reclamation plan. Such areas are to be seeded and planted
immediately after grading is completed or within appropriate planting seasons,
but in any case, the grading and planting shall be completed within one year.
   B.   Topographic Map: Topographic map of the proposed site reflecting the
phases of reclamation and the final site reclamation, including the final
finished grade of the site and all slopes. The map will be prepared on a scale
of one inch equals fifty feet (1" = 50'), with a maximum contour interval of
two feet (2'). This map should represent the site and all property within five
hundred feet (500') of the project boundary.
   C.   Grading Plan: Shall be drawn and stamped by a licensed professional
engineer indicating the areas to be reclaimed and the proposed finished grades.
The method by which the rehabilitation is to be accomplished.
   D.   Revegetation Plan: Landscape specifications, including the plant type,
size, quantities, locations, installation of topsoil, specifications for plant
applications, mulching and type of irrigation to be used.
   E.   Drainage/Hydrology Plan: Indicating the hydrological characteristics of
the site after reclamation, including the creation or modification of
floodplains, erosion characteristics, drainage patterns and wetlands.
   F.   Proposed Use: A site plan shall be developed representing the proposed
use or uses for the site following reclamation, including the proposed zoning
for the site, building locations, roads, streets, topography, parking and
landscaping.
   G.   Cross Sections: Cross sections of the excavation site in areas of
greatest material displacement. The number of required cross sections shall be
dependent upon the size and topography of the excavation site.
   H.   Restoration Material: All material used in the final grading of the
site shall be free from refuse or toxic contaminants and shall be compacted as
much as is practicable. The original topsoil removed from the site shall be
stockpiled and used in the final grading of the site. Final soil depths and
types shall be appropriate for the future use.
   I.   Building And Equipment Removal: Following the completion of excavation
and processing activities, all buildings, equipment and utilities used in the
administration and management of the operations shall be removed. This removal
shall be completed within the first thirty (30) days following the completion
of mining operations.
   J.   Financial Analysis: A financial analysis shall be prepared detailing
all the costs of the reclamation plan. The applicant shall provide to the city
a form of financial security (acceptable to the city), that will assure the
implementation of the reclamation plan.
   K.   Plan Modification: Plan modifications may be submitted any time during
the reclamation process. The modifications must be submitted to the planning
commission with adequate documentation supporting the request. If the planning
commission approves the modification, then the amended reclamation plan will
govern the final process. (Ord. 97-13, 3-12-1997)
9-12C-5: RECLAMATION FINANCIAL GUARANTEE:
   A.   Included Requirements: Before issuing or renewing a permit for
excavation, the city shall receive from the permittee a bond in a form
acceptable to the city. The bond shall guarantee that the requirements of the
permittee's reclamation plan shall be met. The bond shall be forfeited to the
city if the permittee does not carry out the requirements of the reclamation
plan. The bond agreement shall include, as a minimum, the following items:
      1.   Incorporate by reference the reclamation plan, approved by the
planning commission and used by the city to compute the cost of the
improvements. The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to cover the cost of
the reclamation as estimated for the phase or area in which reclamation is
anticipated. The amount of the bond may be adjusted annually prior to the
renewal of the operator's business license and excavation permit, to reflect
any change in the estimated cost of reclamation.
      2.   Completion of the improvements within the period of time specified
in the reclamation plan, following the conclusion of excavation activities in
any given section of the project.
      3.   The city shall have exclusive control over the bond proceeds, and
the proceeds may be released only upon the written approval of the city manager
with written notification to the city council.
      4.   The permittee may apply, in writing, for the release of the bond
pertaining to an area that has been excavated and reclaimed, pursuant to the
approved reclamation plan. The permittee may also request the release of the
bond for areas in which excavation is no longer anticipated. The permittee must
first submit and receive approval of a revised excavation plan with maps
reflecting the amendments. No modifications to the bond agreement will be
authorized until the city has inspected the improvements and found them to be
in compliance with city standards and the provisions of the approved
reclamation plan. No modifications to or reductions in the bond agreement will
be made without the written authorization of the city manager. Modifications or
reductions granted will not alter the permittee's responsibility and liability
for the final reclamation of the site in accordance with the approved
reclamation plan.
      5.   Since the permittee retains the ultimate responsibility for the
reclamation of the site, if the bond proceeds are inadequate to pay the cost of
the reclamation improvements, the permittee shall be responsible for any and
all deficiencies.
      6.   A full bond release will be permitted following the completion of
all requirements specified in the approved reclamation plan and upon the city's
acceptance of the project as complete. The city's acceptance shall be
conditioned upon a final inspection of the site improvements, to ensure their
compliance with the approved reclamation plan. Bond release will require the
written authorization of the city manager.
      7.   Bond proceeds shall be transferred to the city within thirty (30)
days of the city manager's written demand. If the funds are not transferred as
required, all costs incurred by the city in obtaining the funds shall be the
responsibility of the permittee. The city may deduct an amount equal to its
costs from the bond proceeds.
      8.   Following the receipt of the bond proceeds, the project costs shall
include the reimbursement of costs incurred by the city for the administration
and inspection of project improvements.
      9.   The permittee shall agree to hold the city harmless from any and all
liability which may arise as a result of the improvements made in accordance
with the approved reclamation plan.
   B.   Instruments Acceptable: The bond agreement shall reflect one of the
following financial security instruments, as approved by the city:
      1.   Bond with a surety company licensed to do business in the state;
      2.   Cashier's check or a money market certificate made payable only to
the city;
      3.   Trust or escrow account with a financial institution federally or
state insured. (Ord. 97-13, 3-12-1997)
9-12C-6: PROGRESS REPORT:
The permittee conducting excavation operations shall file an operations and
progress report with the city at the end of each calendar year. This report
shall summarize the activities taken in fulfillment of the requirement of
simultaneous excavation and reclamation in compliance with the approved
reclamation plan. This progress report shall include a site plan indicating the
current extent of operations, reclamation completed and updates on significant
issues raised either by the permittee or the city. The progress report shall
include calculations by a licensed land surveyor indicating the volume of
material excavated during the calendar year. (Ord. 97-13, 3-12-1997)

SECTION:
9-12F-1: Purpose
9-12F-2: Airport Overlay Zone Boundaries And Avigation Easement
9-12F-3: Height Limitations
9-12F-4: Use Restrictions
9-12F-1: PURPOSE:
The Airport Overlay Zone is established to notify property owners within the
Airport Influence Area of the St. George City Regional Airport regarding the
impacts associated with aircraft operation and to institute general safety
requirements. The St. George City Regional Airport provides a regional
transportation link that is vital to the economic welfare of the region.
Therefore, it has been determined that an Airport Overlay Zone should be
established, which recognizes the impacts present outside of the Airport
boundaries. Obstructions that affect the landing, take off, and maneuvering of
aircraft impair the utility of airports and the public use thereof. Therefore,
it is necessary in the interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of
the public that an Airport Overlay Zone be established to prevent hazards, to
the extent possible. (Ord. 2024-26, 11-13-2024)
9-12F-2: AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONE BOUNDARIES AND AVIGATION EASEMENT:
There is defined in Utah Code 72-10-401(3) an "Airport Influence Area", which
in the case for Washington City regards the St. George City Regional Airport
traffic that traverses through a portion of Washington City. This Airport
Influence Area, as defined by the Utah Code, shall constitute the same boundary
and area description as the Airport Overlay Zone established by this Article F,
and shall be specifically defined as lands within the Washington City corporate
boundaries that are located within a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet
from the St. George City Regional Airport runway.
Prior to obtaining a building permit, any new construction (except remodeling)
shall grant or sell, at appraised fair market value, an avigation easement to
the St. George City Regional Airport that notifies current and subsequent
property owners that their property is located within the Airport Influence
Area and may be subject to impacts generated by aircraft. The terms of the
avigation easement granted or sold to the St. George City Regional Airport may
grant perpetual rights to the St. George City Regional Airport for the airspace
above the land, for the free and unrestricted passage of aircraft, to the
extent that aircraft using the St. George City Regional Airport facilities do
not exceed current federal guidelines, including any amendments, for Airport
noise. (Ord. 2024-26, 11-13-2024)
9-12F-3: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
No Structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained within the Airport
Overlay Zone to a height in excess of the height limitations specified in
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 77, "Objects Affecting Navigable
Airspace." Those structures exceeding three hundred fifty (350) feet in height
may be affected. (Ord. 2024-26, 11-13-2024)
9-12F-4: USE RESTRICTIONS:
Within the Airport Overlay Zone, no land use activity shall create any
electrical interference with navigational signals for radio communications
between the Airport and the aircraft, making it difficult for pilots to
distinguish Airport lights and signals, causing glare in the eyes of pilots
using the Airport, impairing visibility in the vicinity of the Airport, or
otherwise in any way creating a hazard or endangering the landing, take off, or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the Airport. (Ord. 2024-26, 11-13-

9-13A-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of this article, and any rules, regulations, specifications
and procedures hereafter adopted, is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare through provisions designed to establish a planned community
development zoning district which will:
      1.   Provide for the harmonious and coordinated development of the city
by allowing for the systematic implementation of large residential or mixed use
development proposals;
      2.   Facilitate large scale, mixed use developments incorporating various
types of residential, commercial and industrial uses and zoning concepts which
may create significant impacts on the city, while maximizing the public benefit
from such developments, and minimizing any adverse impacts of such
developments;
      3.   Provide a streamlined review procedure for such development
proposals designed to accommodate a multiple phased approach to design and
construction of large residential or mixed use developments;
      4.   Prevent the waste of public and private resources and the escalation
in the cost of development associated with duplicative land development, review
and approval procedures, regulations and amendments thereto;
      5.   Encourage continuity in design and planning of large residential or
mixed use projects;
      6.   Ensure adequate open space for traffic, recreation, light and air;
and
      7.   Facilitate the conservation and production of integrated municipal
streets, transportation, water, sanitation and other related utility systems.
   B.   This article is designed to inform applicants and the public of the
requirements and conditions necessary to obtain approval of planned community
developments (PCD), as defined in section
9-13A-3 of this article. To this end, all requirements, where possible, are
expressly delineated in this article or other applicable ordinances. However,
since it is impossible to cover every contingency and there are some aspects
which do not lend themselves to be easily articulated, this article allows the
planning commission to recommend and city council to impose reasonable
conditions upon an applicant in addition to those expressly required, so long
as such conditions do not conflict with any requirements set forth in this
article or other applicable ordinances.
   C.   This article shall provide a consolidated framework for the processing
of preliminary and final PCD project plans and development agreements, as
defined under this article, and other applicable provisions of city ordinances.
   D.   The application of the PCD concepts created under this article is
intended to ensure substantial compliance with the intent of the zoning
district regulations and other provisions of this title, and at the same time
provide flexibility in order to secure the advantages of large scale site
planning and development for residential, commercial and industrial
developments, or combinations thereof under the PCD zone designation. (Ord. 93-
14, 5-26-1993)
9-13A-2: INTERPRETATION:
The express provisions contained in this article are intended to provide
procedures for large residential or mixed use development applications and to
outline necessary review procedures. Upon final adoption by the city council of
the "PCD project plan" and/or "development agreement", as defined under this
article, the adopted project plan and/or development agreement will be
considered the legal basis for the physical development of the land identified
in the project plan and/or development agreement. (Ord. 93-14, 5-26-1993)

city council or deferred by the mayor. Such curb, gutter and sidewalk shall be
required as a condition of building or use approval.
   A.   Waiver Procedure: Any landowner who wishes to request a waiver of the
installation of curb, gutter and/or sidewalk must submit a written request for
waiver of curb, gutter and/or sidewalk to the public works department. Such
request may be in the form of a letter which describes the unique circumstances
which justify such a waiver. The request will be placed on the next regular
city council agenda. The city council shall use the following standards in
determining whether or not to grant the waiver:
      1.   The density and pedestrian circulation pattern of the immediate area
do not require curb, gutter and/or sidewalks to facilitate orderly drainage and
safe pedestrian access;
      2.   The proposed drainage plan for the subject parcel has been reviewed
by the public works department, and the public works department provides a
written statement concurring with the finding that curb, gutter and/or sidewalk
are not necessary to provide orderly drainage; (Ord. 93-18, 10-27-1993; amd.
2007 Code)
      3.   No city developed drainage and/or circulation plans are available
for the public streets in the immediate vicinity; and
      4.   The landowner agrees to file a written statement with the city
recorder in which the landowner and any successors or assigns agree not to
oppose any special improvement district which may be proposed to install curb,
gutter and/or sidewalk in the future.
   B.   Deferral Procedure: Such curb, gutter and/or sidewalk improvements may
be deferred when deemed appropriate by the mayor. Deferral may be allowed when
the mayor finds that:
      1.   The construction is impractical due to physical constraints which do
not allow installation of such improvements as a feasible element of the new
use;
      2.   The neighborhood is absent similar improvements, and the city has no
plans for the installation of such improvements within two (2) years of the
establishment of the new use; and
      3.   The public works director has reviewed the request and has submitted
a recommendation.
   C.   Deferral Agreement: When deferred, the owner of land requesting the
deferral shall enter into an agreement with the city for the installation of
curb, gutter and/or sidewalk at a future date; as determined by the mayor, upon
the advice of the public works director and city attorney. This agreement shall
provide for the following:
      1.   The agreement shall be acceptable to the public works director and
city attorney;
      2.   Construction of required improvements shall begin within ninety (90)
days of any future receipt of notice to proceed from the city;
      3.   In the event of default by the owner or successors, the city is
authorized to cause the construction to be done and charge the entire expense
to the owners or successors, including interest from the date of notice of the
cost until paid;
      4.   The agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder
at the expense of the owner and shall constitute notice to all successors of
title to the real property of the obligation set forth, and also a lien in the
amount to fully reimburse the city, including interest;
      5.   In the event of litigation caused by any default of the owner or
successors, the owner or successors agree to pay all costs involved, including
reasonable attorney fees, which shall become a part of the lien against the
real property;
      6.   The term "owner" shall include not only the present owner, but also
heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators, with the intent that
the obligations undertaken shall run with the real property and constitute a
lien against it;
      7.   The landowner agrees to file a written statement with the city
recorder in which the landowner and any successors or assigns agree not to
oppose any special improvement district which may be proposed to install curb,
gutter and/or sidewalk in the future; and
      8.   Any other provisions deemed necessary by the mayor or city attorney.
(Ord. 93-18, 10-27-1993)
   D.   Appeals Procedure: Any landowner who does not agree with the
determination of the city council or mayor, or contents of the proposed
agreement to install curb, gutter and/or sidewalks, may appeal such
determination by filing a request for review in writing to the board of
adjustment. Such request shall identify the specific portions of the proposed
agreement which the landowner wishes to amend or delete. The board of
adjustment may utilize the same standards of review for such appeals as are
listed in the waiver section above, as well as other applicable information
provided by the city manager or city attorney. (Ord. 93-18, 10-27-1993; amd.

and terminates if the structure is devoted to a use other than as a residential
facility for elderly persons, or if the structure fails to comply with city
ordinances.
   B.   Conditional Use Single-Family Zones:
      1.   Subject to the granting of a conditional use permit, a residential

requirements shall not include parking on public (or private) streets.
   D.   Automatic Termination: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
chapter 17, "Conditional Uses", of this title, a conditional use permit
granted, pursuant to this section shall automatically terminate (or in the
alternative shall be terminable by the city), if any of the following occur:
      1.   The residence or structure is devoted to a use other than as a short
term residential rental (excluding the occupancy of the residence by the
applicant); or
      2.   There is change of ownership of the property; or
      3.   The residence or structure fails to comply with applicable health,
safety, or building codes; or
      4.   There has been a violation of this section, or a violation of
chapter 17, "Conditionals Uses", of this title; or
      5.   Other activity has occurred at, or related to the short term
residential property, which the City reasonably determines is clearly contrary
to the purpose and intent of this section.
   E.   License Required: The owner or property manager of each short term
residential rental property shall obtain a short term residential rental
property business license as required by this Code prior to commencing the use.
   F.   Rules And Regulations Posted: Each approved property shall permanently
post, in a conspicuous place, the rules and regulations as it relates to the
approved conditions of that particular conditional use permit, for that
specific location.
   G.   Penalties And Enforcement: Any person, firm or corporation, whether as
principal agent, employee, or otherwise, violating or causing or permitting the
violation of the provisions of this section (or chapter 17, "Conditional Uses",
of this title) shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor, subject to penalty as
provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code (Washington City Criminal Code). Any such person, firm or
corporation shall be deemed to be guilty of a separate offense for each and
every day during which any portion of any violation of this section is
committed, continues or is permitted by such person, firm or corporation. The
provisions of this section may be enforced by either civil or criminal actions
in courts of appropriate and competent jurisdiction. The City's choice to
pursue a civil judicial case shall not interfere with the City's right to
prosecute violations of this section as criminal offenses. The City may bring
actions for civil and equitable relief, including enjoining specific land uses
and affirmative injunctions. (Ord. 2015-03, 2-11-2015)

   NONSTEALTH DESIGN: Any antenna or equipment facility not camouflaged in a
manner to blend with surrounding land uses, features or architecture. The
design does not conceal the intended use of the telecommunications facility. A
monopole with equipment facilities above ground and unscreened would be
considered non-stealth.
   PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES: "Personal wireless services" has the same
meaning as provided in section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47
USC section 332(c)(7)(c)), which includes what is commonly known as cellular
and Personal Communication System (PCS) services.
   PRIVATE PROPERTY: Any real property not owned by the City or another public

   C.   Findings: The Planning Commission and City Council shall make the
following findings:
      1.   Personal wireless services are of increasing importance and value to
the citizens of Washington City. The growing industry and evolving technology
continue to increase the quality of life for City residents and contribute to
the public safety, health, and welfare of the City. Accommodating the
expansions of networks and transmission facilities is important to creating a
well-connected, functioning City.
      2.   The City needs to balance the interests and desire of the
telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and
effective telecommunications systems in the City, against the sometimes
differing interests and desires of others concerning safety, welfare,
aesthetics, and orderly planning of the community.
      3.   The unnecessary proliferation of telecommunications facilities
throughout the City creates a negative visual impact on the community.
      4.   The visual effects of telecommunications facilities can be mitigated
by fair standards regulating their siting, construction, maintenance and use.
      5.   Locating antennas on existing buildings and structures, or
constructing an antenna as a stealth facility, creates less of a negative
visual impact on the community than the erection of towers.
      6.   The public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of
telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated
by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive antennas and permitting the
locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and
antenna support structures that are located on property owned, leased, or used
by the City.
      7.   The City owns parcels of property evenly spread throughout the City,
where telecommunications facilities could be located so as to be as inoffensive
as possible to the residents and businesses of the City.
      8.   Transmission facilities are subject to State and Federal laws that
include possible requirements for wireless providers to make room on
transmission facilities for collocation of other carriers as well as local
government authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of
telecommunication towers. This authority allows a city to promote the location
of telecommunication towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics
and environment of the area.
   D.   Applicability: This section applies to both commercial and private low
power radio services and facilities, such as "cellular" or PCS (personal
communication system) communications and paging systems. All cellular
facilities shall comply with the regulations set forth in this section and any
pertinent regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal
Aviation Administration. Neither the term "telecommunication facility" nor the
requirements of this section shall apply to the following types of
communications devices, although they may be regulated by other City ordinances
and policies:
      1.   Amateur Radio: Any tower or antenna owned and operated by an amateur
radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.
      2.   Satellite: Any device designed for over-the-air reception of
television broadcast signals, multi-channel multipoint distribution service or
direct satellite service.
      3.   Cable: Any cable television headend or hub towers and antennas used
solely for cable.
      4.   Wireless Internet: Wireless internet broadcasting.
   E.   Expert Review:
      1.   The City will seek third party review of the following:
         a.   All applications requesting facility height in excess of the
building height for the zone in which the request is being sought.
         b.   All applications requesting a lower preference facility type over
a higher preference facility type.
         c.   All applications for facilities located in a lower preference
zone compared to a higher preference zone.
         d.   Any application the Planning Commission determines the need to
require an expert review due to the complexity of the application or the
proposed facility's potential impact on adjacent properties or important
community viewsheds.
      2.   The expert review must address the following:
         a.   The accuracy of the applicant's submittal and supporting
documents.
         b.   The applicability of the applicant's analysis techniques and
methodologies.
         c.   The validity of conclusions.
         d.   Whether the proposed wireless communication facility meets the
applicable standards of this chapter, as well as any applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      3.   The applicant will provide the technical material required to
conduct the expert review as per the City's application form, including, but
not limited to, the geographic search ring used to identify the proposed
location of the desired wireless communications facility, the handoff candidate
of the proposed facility, and radio frequency propagation analysis. The
applicant will pay all costs associated with the third party review. Prior to
initiating the review the applicant will be required to pay a two thousand
dollar ($2,000.00) deposit. The applicant will reimburse the City the remainder
of the costs associated with the expert review within fifteen (15) business
days of the receipt of an invoice. An application must be denied if all costs
associated with the expert review have not been paid.
      4.   If the City has a qualified employee to do the expert review, it
shall be done by the qualified City employee. If there is no such person
employed by the City, the City shall select the person or entity to perform the
third party expert review. The third party reviewer shall not be an employee or
agent of the applicant.
      5.   If the City determines, based on its consideration of the third
party review, that any technical evidence or justification provided by the
applicant is substantially open to question, the application submitted under
this section may be denied.
   F.   Approval Process: All applications for telecommunications facilities
require review and approval by the Planning Commission. Applications shall be
processed in accordance with the City's permitted or conditional use permit
approval process, whichever is applicable according to the requirements of this
section. An exception to this is when a wireless carrier applies for a facility
to be collocated on a monopole or other structure that was specifically
designed and approved with room for one or more collocated transmission
facilities. In this case, the submission requirements will be the same, but the
site plan may be approved administratively by the Community Development
Director or his assignee.
   G.   Application Requirements: Any person desiring to develop, construct or
establish a telecommunication facility in the City shall submit an application
for site plan approval to the Community Development Department.
Telecommunication facilities that require conditional use permit approval shall
also file an application for conditional use and will be subject to the
conditional use requirements of this section and chapter 17 of this title
regarding conditional uses.
   H.   Building Permit(s) Required: Prior to the construction of any
telecommunication facility, the applicant shall obtain the proper building
permits, road cut permits, and other permits as required by the City. No
building permit shall be issued until the facility has been approved by the
appropriate authority based on the requirements of this section.
   I.   Location And Type Priority:
      1.   Priority Of Antenna Site Location: Telecommunication facilities
shall be located as unobtrusively as is reasonably possible. To accomplish this
goal, the provider shall make a good faith effort to site antennas in the
following order of priority:
         a.   Existing Structures Or Stealth Facilities: First priority shall
be granted to antennas located on existing structures or antennas qualifying as
stealth facilities, as follows:
            (1)   Existing Structures: Antennas located on lawfully existing
buildings, structures or support structures are: a) located on a
telecommunication facility designed and approved for collocation, b) located in
a Non-Residential Zoning District, or c) located in a Residential Zoning
District on property that is being used for non-residential uses (e.g.,
government, school or church); or
            (2)   Stealth Facilities: Antennas certified as stealth facilities
as set forth in this section.
         b.   Monopoles On City-Owned Property: Monopoles constructed on City-
owned property.

         e.   Other: Any combination of antenna type and location other than
those listed above.
      2.   Burden Of Proof: If the applicant desires to locate antennas on a
site other than the highest priority site, the applicant shall have the burden
of demonstrating to the Planning Commission why it could not locate antennas on
sites with a higher priority than the site chosen by the applicant. To do so,
the applicant shall provide the following information to the approving
authority:
         a.   Higher Priority Sites: The identity and location of any higher
priority sites located within the desired service area.
         b.   Reason For Rejection Of Higher Priority Sites: The reason(s) why
the higher priority sites are not technologically, legally or economically
feasible. The applicant must make a good faith effort to locate antennas on a
higher priority site. The City may request information from outside sources to
justify or rebut the applicant's reasons for rejecting a higher priority site.
         c.   Justification For Proposed Site: Why the proposed site is
essential to meet the service demands of the geographic service area and the
Citywide network. If the applicant desires to construct a monopole, the
applicant shall also submit a detailed written description of why the applicant
cannot obtain coverage using existing building or structures or stealth
facilities.
   J.   Permitted Uses: The following combinations of antenna types and
locations are permitted uses, provided that the applicant complies with this
section and any other applicable laws and regulations.

listed as permitted uses above or as not permitted uses below.
   L.   Not Permitted Uses:
      1.   The following antenna types and antenna locations are not permitted,
except upon a showing of necessity (inability to achieve coverage or capacity
in the service area) by the applicant, in which case they shall be considered
as conditional uses:
         a.   Lattice Towers And Guyed Towers: Lattice towers, guyed towers,
and other non-stealth towers, with the exception of monopoles, are not
permitted in any zoning district.
         b.   Monopoles On Private Property In A Residential Zoning District:
Monopoles located on Residentially zoned private property, if the Residentially
zoned property has a residential use (as opposed to a school, church, or other
non- residential use).
         c.   Whip Antennas: Whip antennas on wall mounted support structures.
   M.   Specific Regulations By Type: Wireless facilities are characterized by
the type or location of the antenna structure. There are four (4) general types
of antenna structures contemplated by this section: wall mounted antennas; roof
mounted antennas; stealth facilities; and monopoles. If a particular type of
antenna structure is allowed by this section as a permitted or conditional use,
the minimum standards for that type of antenna are as follows, unless otherwise
provided in a conditional use permit:
      1.   Wall Mounted Antennas:
         a.   Maximum Height: Wall mounted antennas shall not exceed above the
roof line of the building or structure or extend more than four feet (4')
horizontally from the face of the building.
         b.   Setback: Wall mounted antennas shall not be located within twenty
feet (20') of a Residential Zoning District unless it is located on a non-
residential structure as approved by this section.
         c.   Mounting Options: Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet
walls, penthouses, or mechanical equipment rooms are considered to be wall
mounted antennas if no portion of the antenna extends above the roof line of
the parapet wall, penthouse, or mechanical equipment room.
         d.   Color: Wall mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures
shall be painted to match the color of the building or structure or the
background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and the
supporting structure on the building shall be architecturally compatible with
the building. Whip antennas are not allowed on a wall mounted antenna
structure, but may be camouflaged in a stealth facility as per stealth
requirements of this section.
         e.   Maximum Area: The total area for all wall mounted antennas and
supporting structures on any one building shall not exceed five percent (5%) of
any exterior wall of the building.
      2.   Roof Mounted Antennas:
         a.   Maximum Height: The maximum height of a roof mounted antenna
shall be eighteen feet (18') above the roof line of the building.
         b.   Setback: Roof mounted antennas shall be set back from the
exterior wall of the building or structure a distance at least equal to the
height of the antenna above the roof.
         c.   Mounting Options: A roof-mounted antenna shall be mounted only on
structures with flat roofs. Roof mounted antennas may be mounted directly on a
roof, or on top of the existing penthouse or mechanical equipment rooms if the
total height of the antennas does not exceed eighteen feet (18') above the roof
line of the building.
         d.   Color: Roof mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures
shall be painted to match the color of the building or structure or the
background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and the
supporting structure on the building shall be architecturally compatible with
the building.
         e.   Combination Of Wall And Roof Mounted Antennas: Any building may
have a combination of wall and roof mounted antennas meeting the requirements
of this section.
      3.   Stealth Facilities:
         a.   Determination: Not every disguised or screened telecommunication
facility qualifies as a stealth facility. Whether or not a particular facility
qualifies as a stealth facility shall be decided by the Planning Commission as
part of the approval process. In making the decision, the Planning Commission
shall consider the definition of stealth facilities set forth in this section
and shall consider whether the facility is disguised, blended or screened in a
manner that eliminates any negative impact of the telecommunication facility.
Each stealth facility certification applies to one location only. Because of
differing circumstances specific to each site, an antenna that qualifies as a
stealth facility in one location may not qualify as a stealth facility in a
different location.
         b.   Maximum Height: The overall height of any structure proposed to
be used for a stealth fixture antenna shall be consistent with any similar
structure being used as a model for the stealth structure. A stealth fixture
shall be no more than ten feet (10') higher than the structure to which it is
attached; provided the fixture and the structure to which it is attached is
consistent with the character of similar structures located in the same area,
as determined by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall make
specific findings to support its determination.
         c.   Disguise: A stealth fixture antenna shall be disguised as part of
the structure to which it is attached or otherwise concealed from public view
as much as reasonably possible. A stealth fixture antenna may be attached to or
disguised as a flag pole, light pole, power pole, man-made tree, clock tower,
steeple or a structure used primarily for another use so long as any antenna
located on the structure does not detract visually from the primary use.
Stealth fixture antennas and all associated equipment visible to public view
shall be painted to match the color of the structure to which it is attached.
Equipment and/or equipment shelters used in connection with stealth fixture
antennas shall be camouflaged.
         d.   Engineered Structure: A structure to which a stealth fixture
antenna is attached shall be designed by a State certified engineer to verify
that the structure can support the stealth fixture antenna.
         e.   Antenna Size: A stealth fixture antenna, including the mounting
structure, shall not exceed thirty inches (30") in diameter; provided however,
that antennas exceeding thirty inches (30"), including the mounting structure,
may be permitted if the antenna is a stealth fixture antenna located on or
within a clock tower, steeple, man-made tree or other similar structure.
         f.   Conversion: Subject to Planning Commission approval, stealth
facilities may include the conversion of existing flagpoles, light standards,
athletic field lights or other similar structures to a stealth facility
provided the structure's height is not increased more than ten feet (10').
         g.   Utility Pole Antennas: Utility pole antennas may be allowed as a
stealth facility at the discretion of the Planning Commission and subject to
the following minimum requirements:
            (1)   Location: Utility pole antennas may only be located on
existing City owned utility poles except for decorative street lights.
            (2)   Method Of Mounting: Such antennas shall be designed and
installed by the applicant according to Washington City Power Department
specifications and requirements.
            (3)   Height: Antennas shall not extend more than ten feet (10')
above the top of the pole.
            (4)   Antenna Size: The antennas, including the mounting structure,
shall not exceed twenty four inches (24") in diameter.
            (5)   Electrical Equipment: Electrical equipment shall not be
located in the public right-of-way.
            (6)   Agreement: Each telecommunication provider is required to
enter into an agreement with the City prior to installing any telecommunication
facilities in a public right-of-way. The City shall review site plan conditions
prior to the execution of the agreement.
      4.   Monopoles:
         a.   Justification: If the applicant desires to construct a monopole,
the applicant shall first submit a detailed written description of why the
applicant cannot obtain coverage using existing buildings or structures or
stealth facilities. The description shall include a radio frequency engineering
review of the proposed monopole telecommunication facility in relation to the
requested height and possible alternative locations.
         b.   Visual Analysis: The applicant shall submit a visual analysis
which may include photo simulation, field mock up or other techniques, which
identifies the potential for visual impacts of the proposed monopole. The
analysis shall consider views from public areas (streets, parks, etc.) and from
private residences.
         c.   Maximum Height: The maximum height of the monopole or monopole
antenna shall be sixty feet (60'), although the Planning Commission may allow
an antenna or antenna support structure up to one hundred twenty feet (120') in
height, if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the approving body
that the additional height is necessary to obtain coverage or to allow
collocation, and that the applicant has taken steps to mitigate adverse effects
on the surrounding neighborhood. The antenna itself shall not exceed ten feet
(10') in height.
         d.   Setback: Monopoles shall be set back a minimum distance equal to
four (4) times the height of the proposed monopole structure from any
residential lot line, measured from the base of the monopole to the nearest
residential lot line unless the applicant can demonstrate that the lesser
distance is necessary as demonstrated in a certified radio frequency
engineering report.
         e.   Antenna Sizing: The maximum visible width of antennas and antenna
support structures on a monopole shall not exceed eight feet (8') in height or
three feet (3') in width as viewed looking directly at the monopole at same
elevation as the antennas and antenna support structure. "Top hat" design is
not permitted.
         f.   Color: A surface treatment may be required as part of the
conditional use permit so that monopoles, antennas, and related support
structures match the background against which they are most commonly seen.
         g.   Distance From Other Monopoles: Monopoles and towers shall be
located at least one-half (1/2) mile from each other, except upon a showing of
necessity by the applicant, or upon a finding by the Planning Commission that a
closer distance would adequately protect the health, safety and welfare of the
community. This distance requirement shall not apply to stealth facilities or
to antennas attached to lawful structures such as transmission towers, utility
poles, outdoor lighting structures, and water tanks.
         h.   Location On Parcel: Monopoles shall be located as unobtrusively
on a parcel as possible, given the location of existing structures, nearby
residential areas, and service needs of the applicant. Monopoles shall not be
located in a required landscape area, or buffer area.
         i.   Collocation Requirement: Unless otherwise authorized by the
Planning Commission for good cause shown, every new monopole shall be designed
and constructed to be sufficient size and capacity to accommodate at least one
additional wireless telecommunication provider on the structure in the future.
Any conditional use permit for the monopole may be conditioned upon the
agreement of the applicant to allow collocation of other personal wireless
providers on such terms as are common in the industry.
   N.   Additional Conditional Use Permit Considerations: In addition to the
conditional use permit considerations listed in chapter 17 of this title, the
Planning Commission shall also consider the following factors when deciding
whether to grant a conditional use permit for a telecommunication facility:
      1.   Compatibility: Compatibility of the facility with the height, mass
and design of buildings, structures and uses in the vicinity of the facility.
      2.   Screening: Whether the facility uses existing or proposed
vegetation, topography or structures in a manner that effectively screens the
facility.
      3.   Parcel Size: Whether the facility is located on a parcel of
sufficient size to adequately support the facility.
      4.   Location On Parcel: Whether the structure is situated on the parcel
in a manner that can best protect the interests of surrounding property owners,
but still accommodate other appropriate uses on the parcel.
      5.   Location In General: Whether location or co-location of the facility
on other structures in the same vicinity is practicable, without significantly
affecting the antenna transmission or reception capabilities.
      6.   Collocation: The willingness of the applicant to allow collocation
on its facility by other personal wireless services providers on such terms as
are common in the industry.
   O.   Lease Agreement: The City has no implied obligation to lease any
particular parcel of City-owned property to an applicant. The City shall enter
into a standard lease agreement with the applicant for any facility built on
City property. The City Manager or designee is hereby authorized to execute the
standard lease agreement on behalf of the City. The lease shall contain the
condition that the site plan and/or conditional use permit must first be
approved by the Planning Commission before the lease can take effect, and that
failure to obtain such approval renders the lease null and void.
   P.   Safety:
      1.   Regulation Compliance:
         a.   Compliance With FCC And FAA Regulations: All operators of
wireless facilities shall demonstrate compliance with applicable Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
regulations, including FCC radio frequency regulations, at the time of
application and periodically thereafter as requested by the City. Failure to
comply with the applicable regulations shall be grounds for revoking a site
plan or conditional use permit approval.
         b.   Other Licenses And Permits: The operator of every
telecommunications facility shall submit copies of all licenses and permits
required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the design,
construction, location and operation of the facility to the City, shall
maintain such licenses and permits in good standing, and shall provide evidence
of renewal or extension thereof upon request by the City.
      2.   Monopole Safety:
         a.   Protection Against Climbing: Monopoles shall be protected against
unauthorized climbing by removing the climbing pegs from the lower twenty feet
(20') of the monopole.
         b.   Fencing: Monopoles and towers shall be fully enclosed by a
minimum six foot (6') tall fence or wall, as directed by the City, unless the
Planning Commission determines that a wall or fence is not needed or
appropriate for a particular site due to conditions specific to the site.
         c.   Security Lighting Requirements: Monopoles and towers shall comply
with the FAA requirements for lighting. As part of the conditional use permit
consideration, the City may also require security lighting for the site. If
security lighting is used, the lighting impact on surrounding residential areas
shall be minimized by using indirect lighting, where appropriate.
      3.   Abandonment: The City may require the removal of all antennas and
monopoles if the facility has been inoperative or out of service for more than
twelve (12) consecutive months.
         a.   Notice: Notice to remove shall be given in writing by personal
service, or by certified mail addressed to the operator's last known address.
         b.   Violation: Failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after
receiving written notice to remove is a violation of the terms of this section.
The City may initiate criminal and/or civil legal proceedings against any
person, firm, entity or corporation, whether acting as principal, agent,
property owner, lessee, lessor, tenant, landlord, employee, employer or
otherwise, for failure to remove antennas and monopoles in accordance with this
section. The City may also remove such structures itself, and may bill its
costs in removing the structures to the operator. Any lease agreement with the
City may also stipulate failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after
receiving written notice to do so pursuant to this section automatically
transfers ownership of the antennas, monopoles, support buildings and all other
structures on the site to the City.
      4.   Emergency: The City shall have authority to move or alter a
telecommunication facility in case of emergency. Before taking any such action,
the City shall first notify the owner of the facility, if feasible.
   Q.   Additional Requirements:
      1.   Storage Areas And Solid Waste Receptacles: No outside storage or
solid waste receptacles shall be permitted on a telecommunications facility
site.
      2.   Equipment Enclosures: All electronic and other related equipment and
appurtenances necessary for the operation of any telecommunication facility
shall, whenever possible, be located within a lawfully pre-existing structure.
When a new structure is required to house such equipment, the structure shall
be harmonious with, and blend with, the natural features, buildings and
structures surrounding such structure.
      3.   Accessory Buildings: Freestanding accessory buildings used with a
telecommunication facility shall not exceed a combined total of four hundred
fifty (450) square feet and shall comply with the setback requirements for
structures in the zoning district in which the facility is located.
      4.   Parking: The City may require a minimum of one parking stall for
sites containing a monopole, tower, and/or accessory buildings, if there is
insufficient parking available on the site.
      5.   Maintenance Requirements: All wireless facilities shall be
maintained in a safe, neat and attractive manner.
      6.   Landscaping: All telecommunications facilities shall be adequately
landscaped in order to provide visual screening as deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission on a site specific, case by case basis. For monopoles where
there are no buildings immediately adjacent to the monopole and equipment
facilities, the site shall be surrounded by dense tree growth to screen views
of the facility in all directions. These trees may be existing on the subject
property or planted as part of the site improvements. The Planning Commission
may require additional landscaping as part of the site plan approval.
      7.   Fencing: A six foot (6') high solid decorative fence or wall shall
be installed and maintained along the entire boundary line of the proposed
project. Chainlink fencing with slats is not considered a solid fence or wall
for the purpose set forth in this subsection.
      8.   Power Lines: All power lines on the lot leading to the
telecommunication facility shall be underground.
   R.   Historic Districts: Any telecommunication facility proposed for a
location within a Historic District or on a historic landmark site as listed on
the National or State Register of Historic Places must be reviewed by the
Planning Commission as a conditional use. (Ord. 2018-04, 1-10-2018)

the location of the facility in relation to its proximity to the development
site, and the number of on site parking spaces that may be reduced shall be
approved by the city after discussing the option with the developer.
   B.   Providing On Street Parking Spaces: Providing on street parking spaces
on the side streets perpendicular to Telegraph Street and providing street
furniture on the streets fronting the development site, including the costs and
installation of improvements (which may also include piping the irrigation
gutters), qualifies as on site parking spaces. The parking spaces should be in
close proximity to the development site and shall, together with the on site
parking spaces, satisfy the number of parking spaces required for the
development. The design of the on street parking area and street furniture, the
location of the parking area in relation to its proximity to the development
site, and the locations and quantities of the street furniture on the streets
fronting the development site shall be approved by the city after discussing
the option with the developer.
   C.   Contributing To A Public Parking Lot Or Structure: Contributing to a
public parking lot or structure and providing street furniture on the streets
fronting the development site, including the costs and installation of
improvements (which may also include piping the irrigation gutters), qualifies
for a reduction in on site parking spaces. The amount of the contribution for a
public parking lot or structure, the design of the street furniture, and the
locations and quantities of the street furniture on the streets fronting the
development site shall be approved by the city after discussing the option with

commission that the cause for the revocation has been corrected and the
applicant or the use's current owner or operator has submitted evidence
indicating that the site development plan and building elevations approved by
the planning commission and/or city council will be completed in a time frame
accepted and approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 2008-29, 8-13-2008;

The zoning administrator or the designated representative may consider the
substantial effort toward completion in extending a permit, if the sign is not

9-18-13: LEGAL NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Any existing sign established in conformance with the adopted zoning
regulations at the time of construction or placement, shall not be modified or
repositioned on the property without first being brought into conformance with
the most current city regulations governing signage. The term "modify" shall
include the changing of a sign text or message to indicate a change in the
approved use of the property or change in ownership. The term "modify" shall
not include the changing of changeable text or copy on signs designed for such
text or copy.
   A.   Vacancy Or Abandonment: A legal nonconforming sign may not regain its
status after forty five (45) days of vacancy or abandonment, even if the
original business reoccupies the property.
   B.   Special Exceptions:
      1.   An appeal of section
9-18-11 of this chapter may be heard by the board of adjustment which is
authorized to grant a special exception to allow the retention, alteration,
movement or expansion of a nonconforming sign; provided, that the board finds
or is provided conclusive information indicating the following conditions are
met:
         a.   The nonconforming sign poses an alternative equivalent means of
meeting the intent of this chapter and the general plan.
         b.   The action will not impose a burden on other properties in the
city beyond that posed by a conforming sign.
         c.   Approval will provide a forum for free expression or other
articulable benefits to the public. The board of adjustment shall consider
whether approval of such a sign creates an unfair competitive advantage to that
business. A new business generally shall not qualify for a special exception
for reuse of a nonconforming sign left by a previous business. Purely economic
factors, such as the expense of removing or altering a nonconforming sign or of
purchasing a new conforming sign, are not to be considered as reasons for the
board to grant a special exception.
      2.   The board is empowered to attach reasonable requirements (including

9-18-19: COMMON SIGNAGE PLAN:
A common signage plan can improve the design aesthetics of shopping centers and
neighboring properties. If the following provisions are met, a twenty five
percent (25%) increase in total sign area for freestanding signs shall be
allowed as an incentive to incorporate a common signage plan:
   A.   Increase In Sign Area: If the owner of two (2) or more contiguous lots
or the owner of a single lot with more than one main building submit to the
zoning administrator or a designated representative a common signage plan that
conforms to the provisions contained herein, a twenty five percent (25%)
increase in the maximum total freestanding sign area shall be allowed for the
combined lots or buildings, to be allocated as the owner elects; provided, that
the maximum sign area for any one freestanding sign be limited to five hundred
(500) square feet. Additional freestanding sign area may be allowed for any one
sign with conditional use permit approval in order to allow for adequate
visibility for the traveling public.
   B.   Site Plan: The common signage plan shall include an accurate site plan
of the lots that will be included in the plan (shopping centers or neighboring
properties) showing the locations of buildings, parking lots, driveways and
landscaped areas; the computation of the maximum total freestanding sign area
allowed, the maximum number of freestanding signs allowed, and the maximum
height allowed for the freestanding signs; and the locations of all proposed
freestanding signs.
   C.   Consistency Standards: The common signage plan shall specify standards
for consistency among all signs on the lots affected by the plan with regard to
color scheme, lettering or graphic style, lighting, building sign locations,
sign material and sign proportions.
   D.   Number: The number of freestanding signs shall be limited to a total of
one for each street on which the lots included in the plan have frontage, and
shall provide for shared or common usage of such signs. For lots zoned C-2 or
C-3 within one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') of a freeway exit, one
additional freestanding sign may be allowed if it is limited to a monument type
of freestanding sign. All freestanding signs shall be separated by at least one
hundred feet (100').
   E.   Other Restrictions: The common signage plan may contain such other
restrictions as the owner of the lots may reasonably determine.
   F.   Signatures Required: The common signage plan shall be signed by all
owners or their authorized agents in such form as the zoning administrator or
the designated representative shall require.
   G.   Amendment To Plan: A common signage plan may be amended by submitting a
new plan that conforms to all requirements of the common signage plan
provisions then in effect.
   H.   Existing Nonconforming Signs: If any new or amended common signage plan
is submitted for a property on which existing signs are located, it shall
include a schedule for bringing into conformance, within three (3) years, all
signs not conforming to the proposed amended plan or the requirements of the
common signage plan provisions in effect on the date of submission.
   I.   Conformance With Plan Required: After the zoning administrator or the
designated representative approves a common signage plan, no sign shall be
erected, placed, painted or maintained, except in conformance with such plan,
and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this chapter.
In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other
provision of this chapter, this chapter shall control.
   J.   Plans Not Meeting Objective: The objective of a common signage plan is
to prevent sign clutter by reducing the number of freestanding signs and/or
having a common design theme for signs. If the zoning administrator or the
designated representative determines that a plan does not meet that objective,
the applicant shall either revise the plan or take the proposal to the planning
commission for their consideration. If the plan is taken to the planning
commission, they will be the approving body for the plan, but only after they
determine that it meets the stated objective.
   K.   Other Signs: The size and placement of entrance and exit signs, awning
signs, flat signs, wall signs, marquee signs, projecting signs, and roof signs
are regulated by the provisions contained elsewhere in this chapter. (Ord.

9-20-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent any deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse
secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses and to regulate the
signage to control the adverse effects of such signage and prevent
inappropriate exposure to the community. This chapter by its terms is designed
to prevent crime, protect the city retail trade, maintain property values and
generally protect and preserve the quality of the city neighborhoods,
commercial districts, and the quality of life. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material. This chapter is to be construed as a regulation of time,
place and manner of the operation of these businesses consistent with the
limitations provided by provisions of the United States and Utah constitutions.

11-1-2: Findings Of Fact
11-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
11-1-4: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
11-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state has in Utah Code Annotated section 10-3-701 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry. (1989 Code § 18-111)
11-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (1989 Code § 18-112)
11-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (1989 Code § 18-113)
11-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions
for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (1989 Code § 18-114)

11-6-7: Revisions To Erosion Hazard Zones
11-6-8: Development Within Erosion Hazard Zones
11-6-9: Penalties For Noncompliance
11-6-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The Legislature of the State of Utah has in Utah Code Annotated section 10-3-
701 et seq., delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. A significant portion of flood
losses are a result of bank erosion damage. Therefore, the City Council of
Washington City, Utah, does ordain as follows. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
11-6-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The erosion hazard areas of Washington City are subject to periodic
period of flooding which result in erosion damage, loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
and extraordinary public expenditures for erosion protection and relief, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These erosion hazard areas are created by the cumulative effect of
large flood events, the presence of erosive soils in the existing banks, the
intrusion of dense brushy vegetation (tamarisk) within the channel and a lack
of adequate bed grade control, thereby resulting in the frequent shifting of
the river active channel and bank erosion. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
11-6-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to bank erosion
in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly bank erosion protection
projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with bank
erosion and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
erosion hazard zones;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of property within erosion hazard zones in such a manner as to
minimize future blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
erosion hazard zone. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
11-6-4: METHODS OF REDUCING BANK EROSION LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Establishing erosion hazard zone delineations for floodplain management
and land use regulation purposes;
   B.   Permitting proposed development within erosion hazard zones only if it
is protected from erosion by structural measures and can be shown to have no
adverse impact on adjacent properties;
   C.   Adopting river management policies that support preservation of the
natural river systems, promote land uses that are compatible with a natural
river system, and limit construction of structural improvements inside the
erosion hazard zone, except to protect existing structures needed of public
safety such as bridges and existing buildings, or where the channel threatens
to move outside of the established erosion hazard zone;
   D.   Requiring a special use permit to regulate all development within the
erosion hazard zones. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
11-6-5: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this ordinance it’s most reasonable application.
 
                           Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
                           estate, including but not limited to, buildings or
DEVELOPMENT:               other structures, subdivisions, mining, dredging,
                           filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
                           operations or storage of equipment or materials.
                           An area where the hazard associated with the natural
                           process, either sudden or gradual, by which material
EROSION HAZARD ZONE (EHZ): from river banks are moved away causing a river
                           channel to move laterally as denoted by detailed
                           engineering analysis. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
 
11-6-6: ESTABLISHMENT OF EROSION HAZARD ZONES:
Erosion Hazard Zones (EHZ) are delineated on the adopted Washington City
Erosion Hazard Boundary Maps on file at the City Office. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-
2009)
11-6-7: REVISIONS TO EROSION HAZARD ZONES:
   A.   An adopted EHZ cannot be revised unless a detailed erosion hazard
analysis is prepared by a professional engineer with experience in river
mechanics, sediment transport, riverine erosion, hydraulics, hydrology and
geomorphology and submitted to the Floodplain Administrator including the
elements outlined below:
      1.   Historical Analyses:
         a.   Historical analysis of horizontal channel change:
            (1)   Quantify maximum long-term channel movement by comparing
channel position on rectified historical (oldest available) and modern (most
recent) aerial photographs and/or historical survey data.
            (2)   Quantify maximum single event channel movement by comparing
channel position on a sequence of rectified historical and modern aerial
photographs and/or historical survey data.
            (3)   Identify trends of channel movement (direction, scale, and
type) related to the current or historical channel pattern that may affect
future channel movement.
            (4)   Identify changes in channel pattern during the period of
historical record. Determine whether channel pattern changes are cyclical or
evolutionary, and relate pattern changes to the potential future channel
movement.
            (5)   For streams with limited historical data, expand the study
reach to adjacent stream reaches or adjacent watercourses (spatial data
substitutes for temporal data) to identify regional rates of historical channel
movement. Where regional rates of channel movement are significantly different
from historical channel movement in the project reach, the regional rates
should be used to estimate future erosion potential, or a physical reason for
the differences is required.
            (6)   Identify land use changes and human impacts to watercourse,
as well as the historical channel response to those changes. Relate the
potential for future land use changes and human impacts to future channel
changes.
            (7)   Catalogue the record of past floods by magnitude and relate
the observed historical channel changes to the flood series. Where no flood
records exist, examine rainfall records or flood series from adjacent
watercourses to identify periods of likely flooding or drought.
            (8)   Relate the observed historical scale of channel change to the
magnitude and frequency of historical floods, as well as to a potential future
flood series that might occur during the design life of the proposed
development.
         b.   Historical analysis of vertical channel change
            (1)   Quantify past bed elevation changes by comparing historical
and modern topographic mapping, field observations, and channel elevations
shown on structure as-built plans.
            (2)   Identify long-term degradation or aggradation trends in the
project reach indicated by the historical record.
            (3)   Relate observed changes in elevation to historical watershed
changes, natural riverine processes, and manmade changes to the river system.
            (4)   Predict future channel elevation changes and the anticipated
channel response given past trends and likely future watercourse and watershed
changes.
      2.   Geomorphic and Geologic Mapping and Analyses:
         a.   Delineate Holocene and Pleistocene surfaces and landforms.
Surficial geologic mapping for many parts of Utah is available from the Utah
Geological Survey (http://geology.utah.gov/). Detailed soils mapping may be
available in published soil surveys by the Soil Conservation Service or U.S.
Forest Service. References to publications describing procedures for mapping
geomorphic surfaces are provided elsewhere.
         b.   Subdivide Holocene surfaces by age, topography, and surficial
characteristics to constrain long-term rate of lateral movement in modern
geologic time. Map the extent and describe the physical characteristics of each
Holocene surface.
         c.   Conduct subsurface investigations using test pits or borings to
quantify physical differences between Holocene surfaces such as resistance to
erosion, clay content, degree of carbonate cementation, induration, sediment
size, bedding, degree of soil development, color, provenance, or other
characteristics.
         d.   Use geomorphic mapping to calibrate the minimum long-term rate of
lateral movement within the stream corridor, and maximum magnitude of channel
movement within different time periods represented by the Holocene surfaces.
         e.   Identify and map the extent and lithology of bedrock outcrops.
Identify physical barriers to lateral channel movement.
         f.   Describe modern geomorphic setting relative to local historical
geology and channel evolution to determine trends of expected future channel
change.
         g.   Examine a longitudinal profile of the stream to identify knick
points, convexities, or other slope irregularities relative to the position of
the proposed development. Predict changes in channel profile and discuss the
implications of profile changes on potential lateral and vertical erosion.
      3.   Field Investigation:
         a.   Describe and document channel and bank conditions in reach, at
minimum using appropriate field data collection methodologies.
         b.   Identify and document stream characteristics indicative of active
or recent lateral erosion. Provide photographs of diagnostic features.
         c.   Identify and document stream characteristics indicative of
resistance to lateral erosion. Provide photographs of diagnostic features.
         d.   Identify and document stream and floodplain characteristics
indicative of potential, historical, or active channel avulsions. Provide
photographs of diagnostic features.
         e.   Conduct stream classification analysis to identify the scale of
erosion potential by analogy to similar stream types.
         f.   Apply bank stability indexes based on field parameters. A variety
of bank stability indexes have been published.
         g.   Identify local bank failure mechanisms. Relate observed bank
failure mechanisms to flow hydraulics & sediment transport analysis results.
         h.   Identify evidence of long-term degradation or aggradation near
the proposed development site or in adjacent stream reaches.
         i.   Identify evidence of bed sediment movement, armoring,
imbrication, and scour for use in verifying the results of sediment transport
and scour analyses.
         j.   Identify archaeological evidence to help identify the age of
geomorphic surfaces.
      4.   Hydraulic Modeling:
         a.   Perform inundation mapping using HEC-RAS or other hydraulic
models to determine the relative magnitude and frequency (recurrence interval)
of floodplain inundation and inundation of Holocene geomorphic surfaces. Relate
the inundation frequency to avulsion potential and definition of channel bank
stations.
         b.   Determine channel and floodplain hydraulic data, such as
velocity, depth, and stream power, for a range of flood frequencies to
determine thresholds of channel and floodplain erosion, and for use in sediment
transport analyses. Plot changes in channel velocity and other hydraulic
variables versus stream distance to identify trends and discontinuities, and to
identify channel choke points and flow expansion areas that may impact the
lateral erosion potential.
         c.   Map overbank flow patterns at various flow frequencies, and
identify overbank flow concentration areas to identify possible avulsive flow
paths.
         d.   Determine bankfull discharge for use in applying regime and
hydraulic geometry equations.
      5.   Sediment Transport and Engineering Analysis:
         a.   Estimate sediment transport competence and size range of
transported material at various flow frequencies. Relate transport competence
to bed material gradations observed in the streambed and banks.
         b.   Estimate local scour at a range of flow frequencies and rates and
predict the impact of such scour on bank stability and lateral erosion.
         c.   Estimate armoring potential to whether vertical scour limit
exists in channel at a range of flow frequencies. If armoring is likely, revise
scour estimates accordingly and estimate the potential impacts of armoring on
the potential for lateral erosion.
         d.   Apply equilibrium and stable slope equations to estimate long-
term degradation or aggradation potential. Relate equilibrium slope predictions
to the observed longitudinal profile and potential armoring. Predict long-term
scour by comparing the estimated equilibrium slope and the existing channel
slope, considering natural or man-made grade control features that may serve as
hinge points for channel slope adjustments.
         e.   Apply bank resistance methodologies such as allowable velocity,
tractive force, and tractive shear to determine susceptibility of banks and
surfaces to lateral erosion or avulsion.
         f.   Apply regime and hydraulic geometry equations to determine
direction or potential for future channel adjustments in the main channel width
and depth.
         g.   Perform sediment continuity analysis to identify localize
sediment deficits or surplus and relate to areas of expected erosion and
deposition. Consider potential changes in predicted sediment deficit and
surplus due to channel pattern migration and lateral erosion.
         h.   Consolidate results of engineering and sediment transport
analyses to identify stable and unstable stream reaches and the expected
direction and magnitude of future channel changes.
      6.   Computer Modeling of Lateral Erosion:
         a.   Computer models have not advanced to the point of being able to
accurately predict single event or long-term lateral channel movement.
Therefore, computer modeling shall not be included in the scope of analysis for
a detailed erosion hazard analysis without prior approval by the Floodplain
Administrator. Sediment transport computer models have some utility for
identifying reaches of sediment deficit or sediment surplus, comparing relative
differences between management alternatives, or predicting the expected
direction of vertical channel changes.
      7.   Erosion Hazard Zone Map:
         a.   Based on the results of the methodologies and analyses outlined
above, the erosion hazard zone shall be delineated on a map.
      8.   Report:
         a.   An engineering report shall be prepared summarizing the
methodologies used to support the erosion hazard delineation, the assumptions
and limitations of those methodologies, the results of the analysis, and the
applicable time frame for the erosion hazard zone delineation. The report shall
include photographic and other documentation supporting the analyses and
conclusions. An engineer’s certification shall be provided with the erosion
hazard analysis report. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-9-2009)
11-6-8: DEVELOPMENT WITHIN EROSION HAZARD ZONES:
   A.   All new development proposals, including subdivisions, located within
an erosion hazard area shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
   B.   Development within the adopted EHZ may occur only if an engineering
analysis of the potential impacts of the development on adjacent properties and
the watercourse system sediment balance is completed. Note that, in general, it
is assumed that any channelization or other forms of structural erosion control
will impact adjacent parcels and will have negative cumulative impacts on the
watercourse that will require mitigation. It is the developer’s responsibility
to demonstrate that any such impacts are minimal, justified, and consistent
with the local jurisdiction’s regulatory objectives. The engineering analysis
should consist of the following elements:
      1.   Regulatory Floodplain/Floodway Impacts. Hydraulic modeling of the
pre- and post-project channel and floodplain conditions must be submitted and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator to document the following:
         a.   Floodplain:
            (1)   Changes in the 100-year water surface elevation must be less
than one foot within the property limits and:
            (2)   No changes in the 100-year water surface elevation may occur
on adjacent properties.
         b.   Floodway.
            (1)   No changes in the regulatory floodway elevation are
permitted, either within or adjacent to the proposed project limits.
      2.   Stream Stability and Sedimentation Impacts. Engineering analyses
must be submitted to document that no adverse impacts occur on adjacent
properties due to the proposed structural measures. It is recommended that the
applicant’s engineer meet with local floodplain management staff prior
beginning any analyses to discuss and review the engineering methodologies to
be used to evaluate sedimentation impacts.
      3.   Statement of Findings. An engineering report shall be prepared
summarizing the methodologies used to support the impact analysis, the
assumptions and limitations of those methodologies, and the results of the
analysis. The report shall include all computations and other documentation
supporting the analyses and conclusions. An engineer’s certification shall be
provided with the impact analysis report. The report shall include the
engineer’s professional opinion that when the erosion protection measures, if
any, are implemented, the proposed development will not be adversely affected
by erosion and that the erosion protection measures, if any, will not adversely
affect reaches or development upstream, downstream, and across river.
   C.    All development shall meet all applicable provisions of the
international building code with regard to wall and footing setbacks for
slopes, grading, drainage and compaction of fills.
   D.   All development shall provide for the perpetual inspection and
maintenance of the erosion protection, if any, at no cost to the City or other
public agency.
   E.   All development shall provide a maintenance and access easement to any
erosion protection. Access to erosion protection, if any, shall be located and
constructed so as to minimize flood damage.
   F.   New development shall obtain necessary Section (404) permit from the
United States Army Corps of Engineers, and Stream Alteration permits from the
office of the Utah State Engineer prior to any construction activity at no cost
to the City;
   G.   New development shall hold the City harmless from all claims resulting
from erosion or any other flood related damage to development within an Erosion
Hazard Zone by executing a “Flood and Erosion Hazard Disclaimer of Liability
and Agreement” and by placing a “Notice of Hazard” on the final plat if
applicable.
   H.   All development proposals including subdivisions shall have public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed so as to minimize flood damage.
   I.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided each lot or building pad
for all subdivision proposals and other development.
   J.   All development proposals including grading shall comply with the
recommendations of the Virgin River Master Plan prepared by Tom Moody, Natural
Channel Design, October, 2007. Copies are available from the public works
department.
   K.   All development including grading within the EHZ requires a Floodplain
Development Permit approved by the Floodplain Administrator. (Ord. 2009-24, 12-
9-2009)
