4-4-4: STANDARDS FOR MEASURING SOUND LEVELS:
The following standards shall apply to the measurement of sound levels pursuant
to this chapter:
A.   Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under
investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at
other conditions, including, but not limited to, design, maximum, and
fluctuating rates.
B.   When a noise source can be identified and measured in more than one type
of premises, the limits of the most restrictive use shall apply at the property
line between different premises types.
C.   All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
1.   Sound pressure level measurements must be made with a calibrated and
certified Type 2 sound level meter or better instrument as specified in the
American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI) publication S1.4-1983
(Reaffirmed 2001) entitled, “Specifications for Sound Level Meters”, or its
current successor; or the International Electrochemical Commission (IEC) class
or type 1 and 2 standard 61672.
2.   All sound level measurements required by this Regulation must be taken in
dBA, unless specifically measuring infrasound and ultrasound, which will be
taken in dBZ.
3.   Infrasound and Ultrasound. For any source of sound which emits infrasound
(below 16 Hz) or ultrasound (above 20 kHz) frequencies, the sound pressure
level must not exceed 100 dBZ when measured from the receiving property.
4.   Pure Tone and Repetitive Impulse Sound. For any stationary source of sound
that emits a pure tone or repetitive impulse sound, the limits set forth in
Table 1a must be reduced by 5 dBA when measured between the hours of 7:00 a.m.
to 10:00 p.m. and reduced by 10 dBA for Type A and Type B property use when
measured between the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
5.   Non-Sound Based Vibrations. The transmission of vibrations that are not
sound based and cannot be measured by a sound pressure meter are not restricted
by this Chapter.
6.   The enforcement official shall, to the extent practicable, identify all
sources contributing sound to the point of measurement.
7.   Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the
receiving property; provided that whenever it is impossible or impractical to
measure at the property line, a greater distance from the noise source shall be
used to determine compliance with this chapter.
8.   The SLM must be calibrated in accordance with manufacturer specifications.
9.   No outdoor measurements shall be taken:
a.   During periods when wind speeds (including gusts) exceed fifteen miles per
hour (15 mph);
b.   Without a windscreen, recommended by the SLM manufacturer, properly
attached to the SLM;
c.   Under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet (e.g., rain, snow,
or condensation); or
d.   When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the
SLM.
D.   The report for each measurement shall include:
1.   The date, day of the week, and times at which measurements are taken;
2.   The times of calibration;
3.   The weather conditions;
4.   The identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer, model
number, and serial number;
5.   The normal operating cycle of the sources in question with a description
of the sources;
6.   The ambient sound level, in dBA, with the sources in question operating;
7.   The background sound level, in dBA, without the sources in question
operating; and
8.   A sketch of the measurement site, including measurement locations and
relevant distances, containing sufficient information for another investigator
to repeat the measurements under similar conditions.
E.   Prior to taking measurements the enforcement official shall explore the
vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that
could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character
of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to
measure the sound from the source in question.
F.   When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than
one second at a time, the SLM shall be set for A-weighting, slow meter response
speed, and the range (if the SLM is designed to read levels over different
ranges of SPLs) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to
the maximum end of the scale. When the measured sound level is variable or
fluctuating over a range greater than +3 dBA, using the slow meter response
speed, the fast meter response speed shall be used. In either case, both the
minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of
monitored values.
G.   The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet (3') above the
ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be
held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the
SLM manufacturer.
H.   If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs,
that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the
measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of
such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest.
I.   The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to
ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.
4-4-5: PROHIBITED NOISE: 
It is unlawful for any person to intentionally or recklessly create the
following noise disturbances within the City:
A. Disruption Of Dwelling: To make, cause or permit any excessive or
unreasonable noise which annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,
health or safety of any neighborhood or person residing therein which, under
the circumstances, would disturb a person of average and reasonable

for Appeal Hearing Procedures. After the hearing and depending upon the
findings as to whether the person has complied with the provisions of this
Chapter, the Enforcement Official may continue the order in effect or modify or
revoke it. If circumstances warrant because of the seriousness of the hazard,

initial violation may constitute a class B misdemeanor.
2.   Civil AND Administrative Penalties.
a.   Penalties may be included in a Settlement Agreement or Stipulation &
Consent Order. Penalties may be assessed according to the following factors:
(1)   The violator’s history of compliance or non-compliance;
(2)   The violator’s economic benefit of non-compliance;
(3)   The documented costs associated with environmental or health damage;
(4)   The violator’s degree of willfulness or negligence; and

Permits shall not be transferable or assignable, and Work shall not be
performed under a permit in any place other than that specified in the permit.
The owner(s) and operator(s) listed on the Notice of Intent shall be the
permittee and responsible party. Nothing herein contained shall prevent a
permittee from subcontracting the work to be performed under a permit;
provided, however, that the holder of the permit shall be and remain
responsible for the performance of the work under the permit, and for all
bonding, insurance and other requirements of this chapter and under said
permit. Subcontractors shall also be appropriately licensed, insured and
bonded. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-15: WAIVER OF PERMIT REQUIREMENT: Low Erosivity Waiver
   A.   Request Filed: Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management
as required by this chapter unless a written request is filed to waive this
requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater pollution prevention plan
requirements shall be submitted to the city engineer for approval.
   B.   Conditions: The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant; provided,
that at least one of the following conditions applies:
      1.   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      2.   Alternative minimum requirements for on site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater pollution
prevention plan that has been approved by the public works department and the
implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance.
      3.   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off site facility.
The off site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on site practices, and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice.
      4.   The engineering department finds that meeting the minimum on site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      5.   Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
         a.   The generation of stormwater from the site;
         b.   The size and cost of stormwater storage; and
         c.   The pollutants generated at the site.
The amount of credit available for using such nonstructural practices shall be
determined by the public works department.
   C.   Prohibited Impacts To Downstream Waterways: In instances where one of
the conditions above applies, the city engineer may grant a waiver from strict
compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable
mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a waiver, the
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the
waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
      1.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other
structures;
      2.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      3.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
      4.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life or property.
   D.   Mitigation Measures: Furthermore, where compliance with minimum
requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy
the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by
the jurisdictional stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
      1.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
      2.   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter;
      3.   Monetary contributions (fee in lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities, such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices).
   E.   Fee In Lieu Of Stormwater Management Practices: Where the public works
department waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management
requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate
stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the
applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the
public works department. When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required
stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in
accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater
authority agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the public
works department, and based on the cubic feet of storage required for
stormwater management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program
project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any
building permit for the development.
   F.   Dedication Of Land: In lieu of a monetary contribution, partially or
totally, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management
by entering into an agreement with the city engineer for the granting of an
easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the
construction of an off site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall
be entered into by the applicant and the city engineer prior to the recording
of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the
building permit. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-16 12: REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PERMIT:
A.   To apply for a prevention plan approval, an applicant shall submit to the
city a prevention plan for review.
 
B.   The city has 14 business days after the day on which an applicant submits
a prevention plan to review the prevention plan for compliance with local
ordinances, state law, and federal law.
 
C.   The city may request more information, or modification to the prevention
plan, if the request:
1.   Is specific for more information, lists specifically why the prevention
plan is
noncompliant; and

(A)Includes citations to the permit requirements, local
ordinances, or state law,
or federal law that require the modification to the prevention plan; and
   (B)Is logged in an index of requested modification.
D. The city has five business days after the day on which the applicant submits
the
information or modification described in Subsection (12)(B) to complete the
review of
the prevention plan.
E. Once the review of the prevention plan is complete, the municipal system
authority
shall notify the applicant, in writing, whether the authorization to discharge
is granted.
   A.   Review; Determination: The engineering department will review each
application to determine its conformance with the provisions of this
regulation. Within thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the
engineering department shall, in writing:
      1.   Approve the permit application;
      2.   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions
as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this regulation,
and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
      3.   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the reasons and
procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission. (Ord. 2016-
12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-17: MANAGEMENT CONCEPT PLAN REQUIRED:
   A.   Information Required; Intent: A stormwater management concept plan
shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.), to evaluate the
environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all
proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for
managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this
conceptual planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management
measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for
management of stormwater runoff from future development. The stormwater
pollution prevention plan shall be prepared in accordance with the checklist
provided by the public works department.
   B.   Previously Developed Sites: For development or redevelopment occurring
on a previously developed site, an applicant shall be required to include
within the stormwater concept plan measures for controlling existing stormwater
runoff discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this
chapter to the maximum extent practicable. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-18 13: FIELD INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Field inspections during preconstruction and construction shall be
conducted by the public works department or other designated agent as outlined
in the inspection checklist provided by the public works department.
   B.   Final approval inspections will be conducted by both the public works
department (for SWPPP completion and notice of termination for the stormwater
permit) and the engineering department (for final acceptance of stormwater
facilities).
   C.   Access onto private property is authorized for the city engineer, the
public works director, or other designated qualified personnel to inspect
construction stormwater BMPs on private properties that discharge to the city
stormwater system.
   D.   Access onto private properties that discharge to the city stormwater
system is authorized for the public works director to inspect existing
stormwater facilities to ensure proper function and maintenance on an annual
basis. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)

to the construction site; and
2.   Be of sufficient resolution and clarity to assess compliance with general
best management practices.
 
C.   An applicant may opt out of the electronic site inspection and instead
elect an on-site inspection.
 
D.   The city may conduct an on-site inspection if the city:
1.   Has a documented reason for justifying an on-site oversight inspection.,
which may include:
a.   Alterations of electronic photographs;
b.   Failure to submit an electronic site inspection at the appropriate time;
or
c.   The construction site is within one-half mile of a river, a stream, or a
lake;
2.   Is inspecting a state transportation project; or
3.   Is inspecting a military project.
 
E.   The city may require post-construction maintenance agreements.
8-5-19 14: AS BUILT PLANS:
All applicants are required to submit actual as built plans for any stormwater
management practices located on site after final construction is completed. The
plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management
facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection
by the public works department is required before the release of any
performance securities can occur. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-20 15: POSTCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
Unless judged by the public works department to be exempt or granted a waiver,
the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management
at all sites:
A. All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control
the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design
storms and reduce the generation of stormwater runoff. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
B. Stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not be allowed to
discharge into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate
treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the
public works department. In no case shall the impact on functional values be
any less than allowed by the army corps of engineers (ACE) or the department of
environmental quality (DEQ) responsible for natural resources.
C. Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the postdevelopment site shall mimic the annual
recharge from predevelopment site conditions.
D. Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential
pollutant loadings, as determined by the city engineer, may require the use of
specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
E. Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the public works
department to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-21 16: BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA:
A. Site Design Feasibility: Stormwater management practices for a site shall be
chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that
should be considered are:
1. Topography;
2. Drainage area;
3. Depth to water table;
4. Soil types;
5. Slope of the site;
6. Location of the site in relation to environmentally sensitive areas.
B. Conveyance Issues: All stormwater best management practices shall be
designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
1. Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
2. Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
3. Elimination of erosive flow velocities;
4. Providing underdrain systems, where applicable.
C. Landscaping Plans Required: All stormwater best management practices must
have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and
how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be
prepared by a registered landscape architect or soil conservation district.
D. Low Impact Development (LID) Requirements: For new development or
redevelopment projects that disturb greater than or equal to one acre,
including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale, the evaluation of an LID approach is required to implement
BMPs that infiltrate, evapotranspire, or harvest and use stormwater from the
site to protect water quality (see section 10-20-3 of this code).
E. Maintenance Agreements: All stormwater treatment practices shall have an
enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions
as designed.
1. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to
access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine
maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater
treatment practice. The agreement shall include provisions allowing for access
and inspections on a reasonable basis. In addition, a legally binding covenant
specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land
disturbance activities.
2. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, the public works department, after reasonable notice, may
correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing
all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the
event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety
or public health, the public works department shall notify the party
responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing.
Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have seven (7) days
to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After
proper notice, the public works department may assess the owner of the facility
for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work may be
placed on the utility bill and collected as ordinary utility fees by the city.
Failure to pay any portion of the fee may result in termination of water
service, power service, or both. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-22 17: ENFORCEMENT; PENALTY:
   A.   Stop Work Order; Revocation Of Permit: In the event that any person
holding a building permit or site development permit pursuant to this chapter
violates the terms of the permit or implants site development in such a manner
as to materially adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of persons
residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be
materially detrimental to the public welfare, environment or injurious to
property or improvements in the neighborhood, the public works department may
suspend or revoke the site development permit and/or building permit.
   B.   Violation And Penalties: Whenever the public works department finds
that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of
this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice to the responsible person or property owner. Such notice may require,
without limitation:
      1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
 
A. The city:
1. Shall notify the applicant, in writing, of a specific violation;
2. Shall provide the applicant a reasonable time of at least one business day to
correct
the specific violation; and
3. May perform an inspection to verify that the applicant corrects the specific
violation.

1.   Shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the applicant has not corrected the
specific violation; and
         2.   May impose an administrative fine as set forth in Utah Code Section 19-
5-108.3(7)(c)(ii)(A-F), as amended, for each occurrence; and
3.   May impose the administrative fine:
a.    For each business day the specific violation continues beginning on the day
after the day on which the city issues the administrative fine; and
b. Within 30 days after the day on which the applicant corrects the violation.
D.   The city shall:
1. Impose each fine in writing and clearly document the specific violation in the
writing; and
2. Deposit collected fines into a restricted account for education and outreach under
a program.
E.   Except as provided in Subsection (17)(f), the city may not issue an order to
stop
construction activity for a violation if:

1-13-1: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
There is an underlying policy in the city, strongly favoring the careful
consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to
the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty
and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same
time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property
must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction
of property consistent with the constitution. Consistent with this policy, it
is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may
involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist
governments in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings.
It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as
guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is further intended and shall
be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a
specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet
preserve the ability of the city to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill
its other duties and functions. (Ord. 05-6, 6-14-2005)
1-13-2: CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING DEFINED:

States;
      2.   Article I, section 22, of the Utah constitution;
      3.   Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of
private real property by a government entity.
   B.   Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of
private real property is not a "constitutional taking" if the physical taking
or exaction:
      1.   Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
      2.   Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an
individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the
proposed development on the legitimate government interest. (Ord. 05-6, 6-14-
2005)
1-13-3: GUIDELINES ADVISORY:
The guidelines adopted and decisions rendered pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter are advisory, and shall not be construed to expand or limit the
scope of the city's liability for a constitutional taking. A court may not
impose liability upon the city for failure to comply with the guidelines
required by this chapter. (Ord. 05-6, 6-14-2005)

The prohibition under section
3-4-2 of this chapter shall not apply if the owner or occupant of the residence

welfare.
   B.   Simultaneous Excavation And Reclamation:
      1.   The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resource sites with a
projected life of more than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with
the excavation of the resource. A few objectives of simultaneous excavation and
reclamation are to:
         a.   Create a usable land resource and to eliminate waste heaps;
         b.   Prevent shallow, stagnant, small bodies of water, small usable
remnants of land, and eroding, barren slopes all normally associated with open
pit operations, except as providing stormwater detention facilities as
described in a hydrologic report.
      2.   Excavations shall be planned so as to progressively develop the
proposed final landforms by grading and by stockpiling overburden materials in
areas designated for future landforms or in excavations where the material will
be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated. Such
areas are to be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed or
within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and planting
shall be completed within one year. The reclamation plan shall contain a
description of the phased rehabilitation process throughout the anticipated
life of the excavation.
   C.   Rehabilitation Standards: Following the termination of mining
operations, the site shall be reclaimed in accordance with the following
standards:
      1.   The side walls of any pit or mound located on the site shall be
smoothed and evenly contoured, and the floor of the pit or top of a mound shall
be flattened and leveled;
      2.   Mounds of fill shall not remain after reclamation of an extraction
operation;
      3.   No slope shall be steeper than the critical angle of repose for the
material as required by applicable MSHA/OSHA standards (e.g., 33 degrees for
gravel deposits);
      4.   All areas designated for revegetation on the approved reclamation
plan shall be covered with a two inch (2") or thicker layer of topsoil and
reseeded with a hardy plant material having a sufficient concentration to
screen at least twenty five percent (25%) of the exposed surface from view.
   D.   Final Reclamation: Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any
site where operations authorized under a natural resources extraction permit
have been abandoned for a period of at least one year, or otherwise terminated.
The final reclamation shall conform to the plan approved (including approved
modifications) in the natural resources extraction permit. All reclamation
plans shall conform at least to the below listed minimum standards and
requirements listed elsewhere in this article; provided, however, that the
Planning Commission may require more stringent standards where special hazards
exist in order to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the public,
and to prevent injury to property or improvements.
      1.   Grading: Slopes, overburden stockpiles and abandoned soil piles
shall be graded and smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation
of potentially dangerous areas in accordance with the direction of the City
Engineer.
      2.   Water Filled Areas: All excavations which create standing water or
ponds shall be refilled with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply
however to any water filled excavations scheduled to become an integral part of
the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done in
such a manner that the groundwater is not polluted as determined through
consultation with the Davis County Health Department, and State and Federal
officials where necessary. Fill material shall be porous to allow for water
dispersion unless otherwise specified in the reclamation plan.
      3.   Landscaping: Unless inconsistent with the final proposed use of the
reclaimed land, the excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be
replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs, grasses or other vegetative ground
cover, preferably native to the area, or other vegetative ground cover,
preferably returning the land to a natural appearance, or to an appearance
previously approved by the Planning Commission and maintained by an automated
irrigation system.
      4.   Removal Of Buildings And Equipment: As soon as excavation or
manufacturing has been permanently terminated, all buildings and equipment
(including electrical conduits) used in the administration of the operations,
shall be removed unless deemed necessary to the approved final use of the
reclaimed site.
      5.   Final Year Of Excavation: In the final year of excavation, the
mining operation may, as part of the reclamation project, excavate closer than
forty feet (40') to any property lines, but only upon a showing of compelling
mutual good and the approval of the Planning Commission and City Council.
   E.   Forfeiture Of Surety: If the operator fails or refuses to carry out the
necessary land reclamation as outlined in the approved operation and
reclamation plans, the Planning Commission may, after notice and hearing,
declare any surety filed for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate
bond, file suit against the owner and its bonding company. The City shall also
have the right to file suit against the defaulting permittee for costs of
rehabilitation and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 2018-04, 4-17-2018)

provide surety to the City, in a form and amount to be determined by the
Planning Commission in consultation with the City Engineer and City Council.
   B.   Amount Of Surety: In determining the amount of surety to be provided,
the Planning Commission shall consider factual information as to the magnitude,
type and costs of approved reclamation activities planned for the land affected
and the nature, extent and duration of operations under the approved notice.
The Planning Commission shall fix the amount of the bond reasonably related
thereto, to protect the City and ensure compliance with the requirements of the
extraction permit; however, the amount of the bond shall not exceed one hundred
percent (100%) of the estimated cost of rehabilitating the excavation. The bond
shall be periodically reviewed to ensure that the amount of the bond is capable
of ensuring the adequate reclamation.
   C.   Form Of Surety: In determining the form of surety to be provided by the
owner, the Planning Commission may approve a method acceptable and consistent
with the requirements of this article, which may be one or a combination of
corporate surety bond, land, cash or other deposited securities.
   D.   Release Of Surety: The liability under surety provisions shall continue
until such time as released as to part, or in its entirety, by the City
Council.
   E.   Forfeiture Of Surety: If the operator fails or refuses to carry out the
necessary land reclamation as outlined in the approved operation and
reclamation plans, the Planning Commission may, after notice and hearing,
declare any surety filed for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate
bond, file suit against the owner and its bonding company. The City shall also
have the right to file suit against the defaulting permittee for costs of
rehabilitation and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 2018-04, 4-17-2018; amd.

7-5A-17: APPENDIX A-1; BLASTING:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish standards for
regulating rock blasting in natural resources extraction operations to:
      1.   Establish blasting limits, lines, and grades to those shown on the
plans or as established in the field by designated responsible party.
      2.   Minimize blasting adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
      3.   Control blasting techniques.
      4.   Require the use of presplit blasting techniques to form all final
cut slopes steeper than 0.6H:1V.
      5.   Control vibrations, fly rock, and containment of rock above or
adjacent to the existing cuts that may become loosened through blasting and
excavation operations.
      6.   Ensure the repair of any blast and vibration induced damage.
   B.   Definitions:
      BLASTING CONSULTANT: An individual that is a recognized expert in the
field of drilling and blasting whose primary source of income is providing
specialized blasting or blasting consulting services. The consultant will not
be an employee of the contractor, blasting subcontractor, explosives
manufacturer, or explosives distributor. The blasting consultant shall have
successfully completed blasting projects in similar geologic conditions.
      BLASTING SPECIALIST: An individual experienced in blasting techniques for
similar civil and geotechnical works, preparation of blasting plans, blast
materials and instrumentation, and interpretation and use of blast monitoring
records. The blasting specialist possesses all required Federal, State and
local licenses and/or permits. The blasting specialist will be responsible for
supervision of all field blasting operations and personnel.
      BUFFER HOLES: Holes with reduced energy charges drilled adjacent to the
perimeter holes. Buffer holes are usually drilled parallel to the adjacent
holes at the excavation perimeter.
      CONTROLLED BLASTING: The use of explosives in which the various elements
of the blast, including hole size, depth, spacing, burden, charge size,
distribution, and delay sequence, are carefully balanced and controlled to
provide a distribution of charge that will fragment the rock to the required
limits while minimizing overbreak and damage to the rock behind the trim line
to help ensure long-term stability. Controlled blasting techniques include
smooth blasting, presplitting, cushion blasting, and line drilling.
      CUSHION BLASTING: Trim blasting employing decoupled charges and a zone of
rock breakage introduced by buffer holes between the cushion holes and the main
production blasting.

construction of a smooth final plane in rock cuts. Presplitting causes a
continuous or semi-continuous fracture that isolates the rock intended to be
blasted from the final excavation line to produce greater stability in rock
cuts and minimize over-break. Presplit holes are detonated before detonation of
the adjoining production holes.
      PRODUCTION BLASTING OR ROCK EXCAVATION BLASTING: The main fragmentation
blasting resulting from more widely spaced production holes drilled throughout
the main excavation area adjacent to the controlled blast line, that are
detonated in a controlled delay sequence with respect to a free face.
      ROCK BLASTING: The use of explosives to cause fragmentation of
consolidated mineral deposits which includes: drilling and blasting for smooth
blasting; production blasting; trenching; boulder blasting including oversize
blasting by blockholing and mudcapping; controlled blasting including
presplitting, cushioning blasting, or trim blasting.
      SMOOTH BLASTING: Controlled blasting technique used for the construction
of a smooth plane in rock cuts, using decoupled simultaneously fired charges in
closely placed drill holes along the final excavation line intended to produce
a final excavation contour with minimal fracture of the rock behind and
adjacent to the blasted face wall.
      TRIM BLASTING: Controlled blasting along the cut face performed after the
detonation of the production holes.
      TRIM LINE OR CONTROL LINE: The intersection of the desired finished
excavation surface with the existing ground surface.

as practicable and a permit is applied for upon the next regular working day
following the emergency.
   B.   Interference With Utilities: An excavator shall not interfere with any
existing utility without the written consent of the governing body and without
advance notice to the owner of the utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate
an existing utility, it shall be done by its owner unless the owner otherwise
directs. No utility, whether owned by the city or by a private enterprise,
shall be removed to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be
borne by the permittee or an expressly written agreement is made whereby the
utility owner and the excavator make other arrangements relating to such cost.
The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work, and shall do everything necessary to support, sustain and
protect them under, over, along or across the work. In case any of the pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged (and for this purpose
pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a
substructure), they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, but
the utility owner shall be reimbursed for the expense of such repairs by the
permittee. It is the intent of this subsection that the permittee shall assume
all liability for damage to substructures, and any resulting damage or injury
to anyone because of such substructure damage, and such assumption of liability
shall be deemed a contractual obligation which the permittee accepts upon
acceptance of an excavation permit. The city need not be made a party to any
action because of this subsection. The permittee shall inform itself as to the
existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same
against damage.
   C.   Jetting Pipe: Jetting pipe by means of water under pressure, or
compressed air, is permitted only when approved by the city.
   D.   Bond Required:
      1.   In order to ensure proper backfill and restoration of surface, the
permittee shall deposit a cash deposit with the city recorder, payable to the
city, except that a public utility operating or using any of the streets under
a franchise from the city will not be required to furnish such bond, providing
such franchise obligates the holder thereof to restore the streets and to hold
the city harmless in the event of any injury to any person or damage to any
property due to negligence of such holder in conducting excavation and
restoration operations under such franchise.
      2.   The amount of cash deposit shall be established by resolution and
may be changed from time to time, but until such resolution is passed, the
amount of the cash deposit shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the
estimated cost of the street repair given by the streets department. (1989 Code

7-5C-5: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Requirements: The Community Development Director and building official,
with assistance from the City Engineer, shall make the inspections hereinafter
required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall
notify the permittee wherein the same fails to comply with this article. Where
it is found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or
shown in the conditional use permit application, the inspector may stop further
work until and unless approval is obtained for a revised grading plan
conforming to the existing conditions.
   B.   Plans Maintained On Site: Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of
approval of the Planning Commission, shall be maintained at the site during the
progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, a card issued by
the City indicating permission to grade has been granted, shall be prominently
displayed near the front property line of the property involved so as to be
visible from the street on which the property fronts.
   C.   Notification Of Inspection: In order to obtain inspections, the
permittee shall notify the City at least twenty four (24) hours before said
inspection is to be made.
   D.   Time Of Inspections: Inspections shall be made:
      1.   Before commencement of grading operations and after required
construction stakes have been set; and
      2.   When all rough grading has been completed; and
      3.   When all work, including installation of all drainage and other
structures and required planting, has been completed. (Ord. 2018-04, 4-17-2018)
7-5C-6: STANDARDS AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: All grading and excavation shall comply with the
requirements set forth in title 10, chapter 7 of this Code in addition to other
requirements of this Code.
   B.   Hours Of Operation: All grading and excavation in or contiguous to
residential neighborhoods shall be carried on between the hours of seven
o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. The City may waive this
requirement if it is shown that restricting the hours of operation would unduly
interfere with the development of the property and it is shown that other
properties or neighborhood values would not be adversely affected.
   C.   Dust And Dirt Control: All graded or disturbed surfaces of excavations,
and all equipment, materials and roadways on the site shall be dampened or
suitably treated, managed or contained to prevent the deposit of dust on
neighboring properties; all materials transported to or from the site shall be
so contained during the transportation as to prevent spillage on streets or
other property outside of the list.
   D.   Slopes: The City Engineer may require the percent of slope of a cut or
fill to be reduced if it is found that the cut or fill is subject to unusual or
excessive erosion, or if other conditions make such requirements necessary for
stability. The City Engineer may permit steeper slopes where the material being
cut is unusually stable.
   E.   Fill Material:
      1.   It shall be unlawful to place fill at any site in the City which is
not "clean" fill material within the reasonable standards of the construction
industry in the State. Generally, "clean" fill material may consist of soil and
rocks and related inert earth material which is substantially free from wood,
roots, bark, tree limbs, grass clippings, yard refuse and other similar
materials.
      2.   In any event, the following materials are not acceptable as "clean"
fill material at fill sites within the City:
         a.   Material which is toxic or which may be characterized as
hazardous waste.
         b.   Material which may be characterized as "solid waste".
         c.   Material containing detrimental amounts of organic material.
         d.   Material characterized as asphalt and related materials and
products, the composition of which includes oils or other petroleum based
products.
         e.   Rock, concrete and other irreducible materials with a maximum
dimension of greater than twelve inches (12").
   F.   Drainage: Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface
waters from damaging the cut face of an excavation or any portion of a fill.
All drainageways and structures shall carry surface waters without producing
erosion to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse
acceptable to the City Engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such
waters. The City Engineer may require such drainage structures to be
constructed or installed as necessary to prevent erosion damage or to prevent
saturation of the fill or material behind cut slopes.
   G.   Finished Cuts And Slopes: The exposed or finished cuts or slopes of any
fill or excavation shall be smoothly graded. All exposed slopes of any cut or
fill shall be protected by approved planting, crib walls or walls and planting
or terracing, or combinations thereof.
   H.   Backfilling: Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in
any slope of any excavation or filled site shall be backfilled and compacted to
the level of the surrounding grade.
   I.   Compaction Of Fills:
      1.   Unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer, all fills governed
by this Code intended to support buildings, structures, or where otherwise
required to be compacted for stability, shall be compacted, inspected and
tested in accordance with the following provisions:
         a.   The natural ground surface shall be prepared by removal of
topsoil and vegetation and, if necessary, shall be graded to a series of
terraces.
         b.   The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not
exceeding six inches (6") in thickness, and shall be compacted by "sheepsfoot"
roller compactor (after each layer is spread) or other method acceptable to the
City Engineer.
         c.   The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at
the time of spreading and compaction to obtain required maximum density.
         d.   The fill material after compaction shall have an average dry
density of not less than ninety five percent (95%) of maximum dry density and a
minimum of ninety percent (90%) in all portions of the fill requiring
compaction as determined by the AASHO soil compaction test method T99-57 or
T160-57, or other testing method acceptable to the City Engineer and Community
Development Director.
         e.   A written report of the compaction, showing location and depth of
test holes, materials used, moisture conditions, recommended soil bearing
pressures, and relative density obtained from all tests, prepared by a civil
engineer or soils engineer licensed by the State, shall be submitted to the
Community Development Director or City Engineer.
      2.   The City Engineer may require additional tests or information if the
conditions or materials are such that additional information is necessary, and
may modify or delete any of the above listed requirements that are unnecessary
to further the purpose of title 10 of this Code.
   J.   Erosion Control And Landscaping: All cut and fill surfaces created by
grading except for firebreak purposes shall be planted with a ground cover that
is compatible with the natural ground covers in the City. Topsoil is to be
stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes. When slopes
too steep to support continuous ground cover have been permitted and in lieu
thereof niches and ledges provided for planting, such slopes need not be
planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines
and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be
landscaped so as to blend into the natural surrounds. All plant materials must
be approved by the Planning Commission prior to issuance of a conditional use
permit.
   K.   Filling For Agricultural And Fire Protection Purposes: Filling of the
ground for agricultural or fire protection purposes shall be accomplished with
such practices as will prevent erosion and damage to natural drainage channels.
   L.   Final Inspection: If upon final inspection of any grading it is found
that the work authorized by the conditional use permit has been satisfactorily
completed in accordance with the requirements of this Code and any other
requirements imposed, the Community Development Director shall so record in the
record.
      1.   The City shall have the power to stop work on any conditional use
permit or revoke temporary conditional use permits whenever it is found that
the work covered by the permit has been materially extended or altered without
prior approval, or that any planting, retaining walls, cribbing, drainage
structures, or other protective devices as shown on the approved plans and
specifications submitted with the application for a permit have not been
maintained in good order and repair.
      2.   Before such revocation, the City shall first give written notice to
the owner of the property involved, specifying the defective condition and
stating that unless such defective condition is remedied satisfactorily within
thirty (30) days, the conditional use permit may be revoked. If the defective
condition is remedied to the satisfaction of the City, the permit shall not be
revoked.
   M.   Special Precautions: Special precautions shall be taken to preserve
life, property values, stable soils conditions and aesthetics, including, but
not limited to, the following:
      1.   Requiring a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered soils engineer
or engineering geologist whose recommendation may be made a requirement for
further work. Such requirement by the City Engineer shall constitute a change
order in the work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result from work performed
hereunder, such work may be stopped and the permittee required to take such
measures as may be necessary to protect adjoining property or the public
safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the City
may specify the time at which grading may proceed and the time of completion or
may require that the operation be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure
completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal
rains.
   N.   Excavations; Exception: All excavations shall be limited as follows:
      1.   No cut slope shall exceed a vertical height of one hundred feet
(100') unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of thirty feet (30') are
installed at each one hundred feet (100') of vertical height.
      2.   No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than a
ratio of two horizontal to one vertical (2:1).
      3.   The Planning Commission, upon appeal, may permit the excavation to
be made with a cut face steeper in slope than a ratio of two horizontal to one
vertical (2:1) if the applicant can reasonably show that the material making up
the slope of the excavation and the underlying bedrock material is capable of
holding satisfactorily on a steeper gradient. No slopes shall be cut steeper
than the bedding planes, fault or joint in any formation where the cut slope
will lie on the dip side of the strike line of the fracture, bedding plane,
fault or joint. No slopes shall be cut in an existing landslide, mudflow or
other form of naturally unstable slope except as recommended by a qualified
geological engineer. Where the excavation is exposed straight above the top of
the cut which will permit the entry of water along bedding planes, this area
shall be sealed with a compacted soil blanket having a minimum thickness of two
feet (2'). The soil for this blanket shall be relatively impervious and must be
approved for such use by the soils engineering geologist. If the material of
the slope is of such composition and character as to be unstable under the
anticipated maximum moisture content, the slope angle shall be reduced to a
stable value.
      4.   No excavation for construction of new utility and telephone lines
shall be made in paved streets within five (5) years after paving. During said
five (5) year period, tunneling under such streets may be authorized if
otherwise in compliance with title 10, chapter 7 of this Code, where to do so
would facilitate construction of new utility and telephone lines, or
maintenance.
   O.   Fills:
      1.   Limitations: All fills shall be limited as follows:
         a.   No fill slope shall exceed a vertical height of one hundred feet
(100') unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of thirty feet (30') are
installed at each one hundred feet (100') of vertical height.
         b.   No fill shall be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in
slope than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) unless the fill material is of
such a nature that a one to one (1:1) slope may be permitted with the
permission of the City Engineer.
      2.   Exception: The Planning Commission, in case an appeal is made, may
permit a fill to be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in slope than
two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) if the applicant can reasonably show the
Planning Commission that the strength characteristics of the material to be
used in the fill are such as to produce an equivalent degree of slope stability
and sufficient strength characteristics to support the fill within reasonable
settlement values so as to produce an equivalent degree of safety.
   P.   Prohibited Activities:
      1.   The provisions of this article shall not be construed as permitting
the removal of topsoil solely for resale, or of permitting quarrying of any
site within the limits of the City unless in a zoning district allowing such
activities.
      2.   This article shall also not be construed as authorizing any person
to maintain a private or public nuisance upon his or her property, and
compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be a defense in any
action to abate such nuisance. (Ord. 2018-04, 4-17-2018)

ARTICLE A. FRANCHISES IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY
SECTION:
7-8A-1: Declaration Of Findings And Intent; Scope Of Regulations
7-8A-2: Franchise Required

7-8A-10: General Provisions
7-8A-11: Federal, State And City Jurisdiction
7-8A-1: DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT; SCOPE OF REGULATIONS:
   A.   Declaration Of Findings And Intent:
      1.   The City finds the rights-of-way within the City:
         a.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of the City;
         b.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
         c.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic
well-being of the City and its citizens; and
         d.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience and negative
impact upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights-of-way;
      2.   The City finds that the right to occupy portions of the rights-of-
way for limited times for the business of providing telecommunications services
is a valuable use of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is
maintained at great expense to the City and its taxpayers, and the taxpayers of
the City should receive fair and reasonable compensation.
      3.   The City finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an
extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way,
Municipal franchising and vital business and community service, which are of
local concern.
      4.   The City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and
citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a
nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to
assure availability for Municipal, educational and community services.
      5.   The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to
franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner
that:
         a.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
         b.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
         c.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm
that may flow from such private commercial use of rights-of-way;
         d.   Protects the regulatory authority of the City, in a manner
consistent with Federal and State law;
         e.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the City infrastructure;
         f.   Protects the public investment in improvements in the rights- of-
way; and
         g.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act" [PL no. 104-104]).
      6.   The City adopts this telecommunications article pursuant to its
power to manage the rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by
sections 253 and 653 of the Act.
   B.   Scope: This article shall provide the basic local scheme for providers
of telecommunications services and systems that requires the use of the rights-
of-way, including providers of both the system and service, providers of the
system only and providers of services only. This article shall apply to all
future providers in the City prior to the effective date hereof, whether
operating with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection
 7-8A-2B of this article.
   C.   Excluded Activities:
      1.   This article shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise
regulated by a cable television ordinance.
      2.   This article shall not apply to wireless telecommunication systems.
      3.   Providers excused by other laws that prohibit the City from
requiring a franchise shall not be required to obtain a franchise, but all of
the requirements imposed by this article through the exercise of the City
police power, and not preempted by other law, shall be applicable. (Ord. 2018-
09, 9-4-2018)
7-8A-2: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Authority Of City To Grant Franchise: The City is empowered and
authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation,
construction, operation, use and maintenance of systems in the City rights-of-
way.
   B.   Every Provider Shall Obtain: Every provider shall obtain a franchise
prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing
telecommunications services, or an open video system or providing services via
an open video system. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may
be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise
for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator
of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to
provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a
telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way for the purposes and for the period stated in the franchise; the right may
not be subdivided or subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its system on the property of others, including the City's property.
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent required by Federal or State
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall
request issuance of a franchise from the City within ninety (90) days of the
effective date hereof. If such request is made, the provider may continue
providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not
made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider
shall comply with the provisions of subsection
7-8A-8D of this article.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the City under the
provisions of this article shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, operate, repair, maintain, remove and replace its
system on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services that
originate or terminate in or transit the franchise.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City, upon the written request of the City,
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Other Permits And Agreements: A provider shall obtain and pay for all
pole attachment agreements, construction, building, road cut or other permits
or approvals necessary under Federal, State or City law or ordinance, before
installing its system. Providers shall comply with all of the provisions of
said agreement or permits and shall promptly complete all work contemplated
under such permits and agreements.
   H.   Term Of Franchise: No franchise issued pursuant to this article shall
have a term of less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years.
(Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-2018)
7-8A-3: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation:
      1.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this article, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
         a.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City to
review an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees,
permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of
application, a nonrefundable application fee and an up front franchise fee, in
such amounts as specified in the comprehensive fee schedule resolution. The
provider may offset the franchise fee paid pursuant to subsection A1b of this
section up to the amount of the up front franchise fee paid to the City. Only
the application fee shall be paid when an amendment to an application is filed
with the City.
         b.   Franchise Fees: The obligation to pay franchise fees shall
commence on the completion date.
            (1)   The franchise fee shall be six percent (6%) of gross
revenues, but cannot exceed six percent (6%). This fee is offset by any
Business License Tax or fee enacted by the City.
            (2)   The City may, at its option, agree to accept services or
excess capacity on a system in lieu of all or part of the franchise fee. The
value of the services or excess capacity in the system shall be fairly
negotiated between the City and the provider.
         c.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for
an excavation permit as provided in chapter 5, article B of this title.
      2.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, all fees shall be
paid on a monthly basis within thirty (30) days of the close of each calendar
month.
   B.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at
the direction of the City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and expenses
that the City incurs for the services of third parties (including, but not
limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or
provider initiated renegotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of
this article or a franchise; provided, however, that in the case of renewal
only, the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of
negotiations. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the Power and
Public Works Department to provide space on City owned poles shall be borne by
the provider.
   C.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
article.
   D.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the City on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent State taxes.
   E.   Fee Statement: Unless a franchise provides otherwise, each fee payment
shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was
calculated.
   F.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the City of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
   G.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in
this article, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the City owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   H.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
article and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation;
provided, that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
   I.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-
2018)
7-8A-4: APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE:
   A.   Form Of Application: To obtain a franchise to construct, own, operate,
maintain or provide services through any system within the City, to obtain a
renewal of a franchise granted pursuant to this article, or to obtain the City
approval of a sale, transfer, lease, sublet or other disposal of a system, or
franchise granted pursuant to this article, an application must be filed with
City.
   B.   Considerations: In making a determination as to an application filed
pursuant to this article, the City may, but shall not be limited to, consider
the following:
      1.   If requested, show evidence that the provider has obtained the
necessary approvals, licenses or permits required by Federal or State law to
provide telecommunications services;
      2.   If requested, provider's financial ability to compensate the City
for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights- of-way during the
franchise term proposed by the provider;
      3.   Provider's agreements to comply with the requirements of section
7-8A-5 of this article;
      4.   The willingness to enter into a pole attachment agreement with the
City.
   C.   Award Of Franchise: The City, in its discretion, shall determine the
award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations relevant
to the uses of the rights-of-way, without competitive bidding. (Ord. 2018-09,
9-4-2018)

following factors shall be considered:
         a.   The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate the provider's
proposed system;
         b.   The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate multiple wire in
addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of other users of the rights-of-way,
such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewage utilities;

facilities, improvements or landscaping; or
         d.   Public interest in minimizing the cost and disruption of
construction from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way.
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance,
repair, upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe,
thorough and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If,
at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority
by Federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the
system, including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals
over or within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare,
or quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost
and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, operate,
maintain, upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any
necessary approvals from persons and/or the City to use private property,
easements, poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit,
license, approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation
permits, pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the
activity for which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
   D.   Relocation Of System:
      1.   New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights-of- way
are changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider
shall, at its own cost and expense and upon reasonable written notice by the
City, promptly protect or promptly alter or relocate the system, or part
thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event that a
provider unreasonably refuses or neglects to so protect, alter or relocate all
or part of the system, the City shall have the right to break through, remove,
alter or relocate such part of the system, without any liability to a provider,
and a provider shall pay to the City the costs, including overhead, incurred in
connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation.
      2.   City Authority To Move System: The City may, at any time, in case of
fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the City in its reasonable
discretion, cut or move any parts of the grades or lines under the rights-of-
way of the City, in which event the City shall not be liable therefor to a
provider. The City shall notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable,
but in any event as soon as possible and in no case later than the next
business day following action taken under this subsection. Notice shall be
given as provided in subsection
7-8A-10D of this article.
      3.   Provider Required To Move System: A provider shall, upon prior
reasonable written notice by the City or any person holding a permit to move
any structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances,
temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of said structure.
A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the City for
any such movement of its systems.
   E.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, operation,
maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its
own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the
City and all designated landmarks, as well as all other structures within any
designated landmark district. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent
of the City to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage
system, or any other Municipal structure on, over or under the rights-of-way of
the City required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration
shall be made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider
agrees that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the City to replace or
repair and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably
specified by the City, any Municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of
the City involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade
or removal of system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any
work thereon by or on behalf of provider pursuant to franchise.
   F.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, operation,
maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not
unreasonably obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guideway systems, railways,
passenger travel, or other traffic to, from or within the City without the
prior consent of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements, including, but not
limited to, the National Electrical Code.
   H.   Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the City, an eminent danger exists, any rights-of-way
within the City which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
operation, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be
repaired by the City at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that
prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall submit
to such a provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and
restoring the rights-of-ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount
thereof.
   I.   System Maintenance: A provider shall:
      1.   Install and maintain all parts of its system in nondangerous
condition throughout the entire period of its franchise.
      2.   Install and maintain its system in accordance with standard prudent
engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the National
Electrical Code and all other applicable Federal, State and local laws or
regulations.
      3.   At all reasonable times, permit examination by any duly authorized
representative of the City of the system and its effect on the rights-of-way.
   J.   Trimming Of Trees: A provider shall have the authority to trim trees,
in accordance with all applicable utility, ordinance and easement restrictions,
upon and hanging over rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees
from coming in contact with its system. The City Forester or his
representatives shall have authority to supervise and approve all trimming of
trees conducted by a provider. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-2018)

      3.   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by a provider so as to create a new controlling
interest in such a provider; or
      4.   The entry by a provider into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of such provider or its system. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-
2018)
7-8A-7: OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION:
   A.   Insurance, Indemnity And Security: Prior to the execution of a
franchise, a provider will deposit with the City an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond as required by the terms of the franchise,

franchise. A provider shall also indemnify the City as set forth in the
franchise.
   B.   Oversight: The City shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance, operation and upgrade of
the system, and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the
franchise and applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain
managerial and operational records, standards, procedures and controls to
enable a provider to prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the
City at all times throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with
the franchise. A provider shall retain such records for not less than the
applicable statute of limitations.
   C.   Maintain Records: A provider shall at all times maintain:
      1.   On file with the City, a full and complete set of plans, records and

resort for the existing system to the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term, a provider shall maintain complete and accurate
books of account and records of the business, ownership and operations of a
provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows the City at all
times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the franchise.
Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained
in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the books and/or
records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance with this
subsection. All financial books and records which are maintained in accordance
with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that regulates
utilities in the State, and generally accepted accounting principles, shall be
deemed to be acceptable under this subsection. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-2018)

State or local court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting
with any Federal or State Statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in
any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the
event that such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise
changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict, the provision in question shall return to full force and
effect and shall again be binding on the City and the provider; provided, that
the City shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time
as may be reasonably required, for a provider to comply with such valid

this article, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently or economically serve itself or the public.
   D.   Notices: All notices from a provider to the City required under this
article or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this article, shall be
directed to the officer as designated by the City Manager. A provider shall
provide in any application for a franchise the identity, address and phone
number to receive notices from the City.
   E.   Regulation By City: To the full extent permitted by applicable law
either now or in the future, the City reserves the right to adopt or issue such

ROW
7-8B-9: Attachment To City-Owned Utility Poles In The Covered Areas
7-8B-10: Design Standards
7-8B-1: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
   A.   The City finds the rights-of-way within the City:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the City;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the small wireless facilities of
service providers, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general
economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience and negative
impact upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights-of-way. This includes placing wires
and equipment inside poles and below ground.
   B.   The City finds that the right to occupy portions of the rights-of-way
for limited times for the business of providing wireless services is a valuable
use of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at
great expense to the City and its taxpayers, and the taxpayers of the City
should receive fair and reasonable compensation.
   C.   The City finds that while small wireless facilities are in part an
extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve public rights-
of-way, Municipal zoning and vital business and community service, which are of
local concern. The City also finds that it has the proprietary right to
determine what persons and entities are granted permission to use City rights-
of-way, and to determine the reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and
conditions of such use.
   D.   The City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and
citizens to promote the development of wireless services, on a
nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to
assure availability for Municipal, educational and community services.
   E.   The City finds that towers and other supporting structures present
aesthetic and land use concerns that should be dealt with by encouraging
collocation, and minimizing the number of structures in a manner that does not
discourage market access or completion.
   F.   The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to grant small
wireless facilities permits to providers that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that
may flow from such private commercial use of rights-of-way;
      4.   Protects the regulatory authority of the City, in a manner
consistent with Federal and State law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the City infrastructure; and
      6.   Protects the public investment in improvements in the rights- of-
way. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-2018)
7-8B-2: PURPOSE AND GOALS:
   A.   The purpose of this article is to establish requirements for the siting
and use of small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way in a manner
that facilitates the delivery of wireless services within the City, while
minimizing associated adverse impacts. The goals of this article are to:
      1.   Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance,
modification, and removal of small wireless services infrastructure in the
City, to provide adequate wireless communications coverage, without
unreasonably discriminating against providers of functionally equivalent
services including all of those who install, maintain, and operate small
wireless facilities.
      2.   Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and
specifically, protect aesthetic values, by reducing the visibility of small
wireless facilities and structures to the fullest extent possible through
techniques including but not limited to camouflage/concealment, design
techniques, and undergrounding of wireless facilities and the equipment
associated therewith, where possible.
      3.   Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive small wireless
facilities to supplement existing telecommunications facilities.
      4.   Encourage the location of structures in a manner that is least
intrusive to the community.
      5.   Encourage owners and users of antennas and structures to locate
them, to the extent possible, where the adverse impact on the community is
minimized.
      6.   Enhance the ability of providers to provide such wireless services
to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
      7.   Effectively manage small wireless facilities in the public right-of-
way. (Ord. 2018-09, 9-4-2018)

8-5-3: STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY:
   A.   Created: There is hereby created and established a North Salt Lake City
storm drainage utility, which shall operate under the direction of the city
engineer. All storm drainage facilities owned by the city constitute the
physical assets of the North Salt Lake City storm drain utility.
   B.   Responsibility For Administration: The city engineer shall administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted or
duties imposed upon the city may be delegated by the city engineer to persons
or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the city.
   C.   Ultimate Responsibility: The standards set forth herein and promulgated
pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not
intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure compliance with
federal or state regulations, or that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
   D.   Operation Of Utility Facilities And Assets: The utility shall operate,
maintain and improve all existing city storm drainage facilities used for the
conveyance of stormwaters, through, under or over lands or watercourses,
beginning at a point where the stormwaters first enter the storm drainage
system of the city and ending in each instance at a point where the stormwaters
exit from the system. However, the utility does not include government owned
streets or those facilities operated and maintained by or for the county or the
state. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-4: PERMITTED DISCHARGES:
The only substance dischargeable into the city storm drainage system is
stormwater, surface drainage, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated groundwater,
roof runoff, cooling water or nonpolluted water. Such water may be discharged
only into storm drains which have adequate capacity for the accommodation of
such water. Such discharged water shall comply with the city stormwater quality
standards. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-5: RATES AND CHARGES:
   A.   Service Fees Imposed: The city will, by resolution of the city council,
impose storm drainage fee rates and charges on each parcel of real property
within the city, except governmentally owned streets. The charges shall fund
the administration, planning design, construction, water quality programming,
operation, maintenance and repair of existing and future stormwater facilities.
   B.   Method Of Determining Contribution Of Stormwater:
      1.   Contributions of stormwater from nonresidential parcels and
residential parcels larger than duplexes have been ascertained by evaluating
land surface and measuring the amount of impervious surface.
      2.   Contributions of stormwater from residential parcels up to and
including duplexes have been ascertained by sampling the amount of residential
impervious areas.
   C.   Classifications: Storm drainage service fees shall be assessed on each
parcel of real property within the city (including city owned properties),
except government owned streets and city stormwater facilities. Service fees
shall be established by resolution of the city council and may be
differentiated according to the following classifications:
      Residential parcels: Single-family residential and duplex parcels shall
constitute one ERU per month.
      Undeveloped parcels: Undeveloped parcels shall have no charges assessed.
      Other parcels: Charges for all other parcels shall be computed by
multiplying the total ERUs for a parcel by the monthly rate. Total ERUs are
calculated by dividing total square feet of impervious surface by three
thousand nine hundred (3,900) (1 ERU), rounded to the nearest whole number.
      Credit for on parcel mitigation: Nonresidential parcels with mitigating
stormwater facilities, e.g., approved on site detention/retention of
stormwater, approved discharge of stormwater through a sewer connection or
other approved and complete on site detention methods that meet the city design
and maintenance standards may be eligible for a service fee credit. The
parcel's owner or agent must make application for this credit to the city
engineer. The amount of credit is based on the following formula:
         P = 50 + 50 (Qr/Qp)
      Formula symbols have the following meaning:
      P = Percentage of storm drainage fees to be applied to the parcel
      50 = Percentage representing utility's fixed operation and maintenance
costs
      50 = Percentage representing costs for utility's capital improvement
program
      Qr = Restricted stormwater discharge from a parcel
      Qp = Peak stormwater discharge from the same parcel that would result if
the mitigating facilities were not in place.
   The city engineer may, if requested, provide a complete on site mitigation
evaluation at the expense of the parcel owner or authorized agent.
   Credit for regional stormwater mitigation: Nonresidential parcels with
mitigating stormwater facilities that serve the city regional stormwater needs
as prescribed by the stormwater master plan and utilizing methods that meet the
city design and maintenance standards, may be eligible for a service fee
credit. The credit may be granted if property owners have not already been
compensated for or agreed to construct the facilities as part of the
development process. The parcel owner or agent must make application for this
credit to the city engineer.
   If a request for mitigation credit is granted, the credit shall be applied
to all charges from the time of the appealed billing, and will be reflected on
the next billing thirty (30) days after appeal is granted.
   Low income relief: A single-family residential parcel owner who qualifies
for the city low income relief, as determined by resolution of the city council
and set forth in the fee schedule, may also be eligible for a reduction in the
service charge for their parcel. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-6: BILLING AND COLLECTION:
   A.   Utility Enterprise Fund: This section creates the storm drainage

apart from all other city funds. The collection, accounting and expenditure of
all stormwater utility funds shall be in accordance with the state uniform
fiscal procedures act.
   B.   Billing: The city shall bill property owners for storm drainage utility
services. Billing amounts shall be included as a separate line item on utility
bills. A billing will also be sent to owners of parcels within the city who are
not city utility customers.
   C.   Collection: Partial payments on a combined utility bill shall be
applied consistent with the billing procedures established by the city. Fees
and charges shall be considered delinquent if not paid as determined by the
procedures established by the city and will be a debt to the city, which shall
be subject to recovery in a civil action. Pursuant to Utah Code Annotated
section 10-8-38, the city may cause the water service to the property to be
shut off for failure to pay for the storm drainage service furnished, as set
forth on the billing. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-7: APPEAL OF CHARGES:
   A.   Appeal To City Engineer: Any nonresidential customer who disagrees with
the storm drainage user fee for his or her parcel may apply to the city
engineer for a user fee adjustment. The adjustment request must state the
grounds for adjustment and must be filed in writing with the city engineer no
later than thirty (30) days after receipt of billing. The city engineer shall
review the request and basis for user charges to determine whether an error was
made in the calculation or application of the fee. The city engineer's decision
shall be final, unless appealed.
   B.   Further Appeal To City Manager: An appeal of a city engineer's decision
may be brought before the city manager within thirty (30) days after the date
of the city engineer's decision. The decision of the city manager is final and
conclusive. If an appeal of charges is successful, credit will be applied to

   D.   Mitigation Measures: Furthermore, where compliance with minimum
requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy
the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by
the jurisdictional stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
      1.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
      2.   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter;
      3.   Monetary contributions (fee in lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities, such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices).
   E.   Fee In Lieu Of Stormwater Management Practices: Where the public works
department waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management
requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate
stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the
applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the
public works department. When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required
stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in
accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater
authority agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the public
works department, and based on the cubic feet of storage required for
stormwater management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program
project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any
building permit for the development.
   F.   Dedication Of Land: In lieu of a monetary contribution, partially or
totally, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management
by entering into an agreement with the city engineer for the granting of an
easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the
construction of an off site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall
be entered into by the applicant and the city engineer prior to the recording
of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the
building permit. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-16: REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PERMIT:
   A.   Review; Determination: The engineering department will review each
application to determine its conformance with the provisions of this
regulation. Within thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the
engineering department shall, in writing:
      1.   Approve the permit application;
      2.   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions
as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this regulation,
and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
      3.   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the reasons and
procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission. (Ord. 2016-
12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-17: MANAGEMENT CONCEPT PLAN REQUIRED:
   A.   Information Required; Intent: A stormwater management concept plan
shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.), to evaluate the
environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all
proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for
managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this
conceptual planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management
measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for
management of stormwater runoff from future development. The stormwater
pollution prevention plan shall be prepared in accordance with the checklist
provided by the public works department.
   B.   Previously Developed Sites: For development or redevelopment occurring
on a previously developed site, an applicant shall be required to include
within the stormwater concept plan measures for controlling existing stormwater
runoff discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this
chapter to the maximum extent practicable. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-18: FIELD INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Field inspections during preconstruction and construction shall be
conducted by the public works department or other designated agent as outlined
in the inspection checklist provided by the public works department.
   B.   Final approval inspections will be conducted by both the public works
department (for SWPPP completion and notice of termination for the stormwater
permit) and the engineering department (for final acceptance of stormwater
facilities).
   C.   Access onto private property is authorized for the city engineer, the
public works director, or other designated qualified personnel to inspect
construction stormwater BMPs on private properties that discharge to the city
stormwater system.
   D.   Access onto private properties that discharge to the city stormwater
system is authorized for the public works director to inspect existing
stormwater facilities to ensure proper function and maintenance on an annual
basis. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-19: AS BUILT PLANS:
All applicants are required to submit actual as built plans for any stormwater
management practices located on site after final construction is completed. The
plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management
facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection
by the public works department is required before the release of any
performance securities can occur. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-20: POSTCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
Unless judged by the public works department to be exempt or granted a waiver,
the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management
at all sites:
   A.   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater runoff. These practices
should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots
and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for
both water quality and quantity.
   B.   Stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not be allowed
to discharge into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate
treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the
public works department. In no case shall the impact on functional values be
any less than allowed by the army corps of engineers (ACE) or the department of
environmental quality (DEQ) responsible for natural resources.
   C.   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the postdevelopment site shall mimic the annual
recharge from predevelopment site conditions.
   D.   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, as determined by the city engineer, may require
the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
   E.   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the public
works department to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater
design requirements. (Ord. 2016-12, 8-16-2016)
8-5-21: BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   Site Design Feasibility: Stormwater management practices for a site
shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors
that should be considered are:
      1.   Topography;
      2.   Drainage area;
      3.   Depth to water table;
      4.   Soil types;
      5.   Slope of the site;
      6.   Location of the site in relation to environmentally sensitive areas.
   B.   Conveyance Issues: All stormwater best management practices shall be
designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
      2.   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
      3.   Elimination of erosive flow velocities;
      4.   Providing underdrain systems, where applicable.
   C.   Landscaping Plans Required: All stormwater best management practices
must have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the
practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan
must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or soil conservation
district.
   D.   Low Impact Development (LID) Requirements: For new development or
redevelopment projects that disturb greater than or equal to one acre,
including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale, the evaluation of an LID approach is required to implement
BMPs that infiltrate, evapotranspire, or harvest and use stormwater from the
site to protect water quality (see section
10-20-3 of this code).
   E.   Maintenance Agreements: All stormwater treatment practices shall have
an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed.
      1.   This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements
required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to
perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
stormwater treatment practice. The agreement shall include provisions allowing
for access and inspections on a reasonable basis. In addition, a legally
binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance
of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any
permits for land disturbance activities.
      2.   If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of
the maintenance covenant, the public works department, after reasonable notice,
may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by
performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working
condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a
danger to public safety or public health, the public works department shall
notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management
facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall
have seven (7) days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an
approved manner. After proper notice, the public works department may assess
the owner of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and
the cost of the work may be placed on the utility bill and collected as
ordinary utility fees by the city. Failure to pay any portion of the fee may
result in termination of water service, power service, or both. (Ord. 2016-12,
8-16-2016)
8-5-22: ENFORCEMENT; PENALTY:
   A.   Stop Work Order; Revocation Of Permit: In the event that any person
holding a building permit or site development permit pursuant to this chapter
violates the terms of the permit or implants site development in such a manner
as to materially adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of persons
residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be
materially detrimental to the public welfare, environment or injurious to
property or improvements in the neighborhood, the public works department may
suspend or revoke the site development permit and/or building permit.
   B.   Violation And Penalties: Whenever the public works department finds
that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of
this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice to the responsible person or property owner. Such notice may require,
without limitation:
      1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   C.   Misdemeanor: Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be deemed guilty of a class C misdemeanor, subject to penalty as provided
in section
1-4-1 of this code, and each day during which any violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted, shall
constitute a separate offense.
   D.   Public Nuisance Declared: Any work done or condition created or
allowed, in violation of this chapter, is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance, which may be abated by a civil legal action by the city attorney.

10-1-27: CLEAR VIEW OF INTERSECTING STREETS:
For the purpose of providing adequate vision of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, a clear view area shall be maintained at the intersection of every
street, whether public or private, and at the intersection of every driveway
with a public or private street. The clear view provisions are considered life
safety standards and shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this title.
No provision of this section shall be construed to allow the continuance of any
nonconforming tree, shrub, plant or plant growth, fence, wall, other screening
material, or other obstruction which interferes with the safety of pedestrians
or vehicle traffic.
   A.   The clear view area for a street intersection shall be determined by
measuring forty feet (40') from the point of intersection of street curb lines,
and then connecting the termini of those lines forming a triangle that
encompasses a portion of the street right-of-way and the adjoining lot. Within
that clear view area, the following shall apply:
      1.   Solid fences, walls, sight obscuring vegetation and/or other sight
obscuring devices shall not exceed two feet (2') in height above the level of
the curb.
      2.   Chainlink fences or fences which are seventy five percent (75%) or
more open shall not exceed four feet (4') in height above the level of the
curb.
      3.   Tree trunks shall not be located within the clear view triangle,
however, tree canopies may extend into the clear view area if they are trimmed
at least seven feet (7') above the ground level.
      4.   No sign shall be allowed in the clear view triangle unless it is
specifically permitted by this title and it is determined by the City Engineer
that it is not a safety hazard. (Ord. 07-13, 6-5-2007)
      5.   No obstruction of any sort shall be allowed which interferes with
the safety of pedestrians or traffic unless it is specifically permitted by
this title and it is determined by the City Engineer that it is not a safety
hazard. (Ord. 07-13, 6-5-2007; amd. 2012 Code)
   B.   The clear view area for the intersection of a driveway and a street
shall be determined by first establishing the point of intersection of the
driveway edge and the street property line, then measuring ten feet (10') along
the property line away from the driveway, and ten feet (10') along the edge of
the driveway in toward the property. A line is then drawn from the termini of
the two (2) lines, forming a triangle. Within this area, a chainlink fence or a
fence seventy five percent (75%) or more open shall be a maximum of four feet
(4') in height, and any wall or other type of fence or sight obscuring growth
shall be a maximum of three feet (3') in height. (Ord. 07-13, 6-5-2007; amd.
Ord. 2025-06, 4-1-2025)
10-1-28: FENCES MAY BE REQUIRED:
When approved by the City Council, the Planning Commission may require the
erection of fences as a prerequisite to approval of any project or to the

conflict of uses. Such fences shall be of a type and size necessary, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, to accomplish the above stated purpose.

decision administering or interpreting a land use ordinance may appeal that
decision applying the land use ordinance by alleging that there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by an official in the
administration, interpretation or enforcement of the land use ordinance. Any
person or any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by the
grant or refusal of a building permit, or by any other decision of the city's
administrative staff in the enforcement and administration of the land use
ordinance, may appeal any decision to the hearing officer.
      2.   All appeals must be filed in writing with the office of the city
recorder, within ten (10) calendar days from the date of any written decision

he owns, leases or in which he holds some other beneficial interest, may apply
to the hearing officer for a variance from the terms of the land use ordinance.
      2.   The hearing officer may grant a variance only if:
         a.   Literal enforcement of the ordinance would cause an unreasonable
hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general
purpose of the land use ordinances;
         b.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
         c.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a

property, not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood;

ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection D2 of this section
or this subsection D3, the hearing officer may not find an unreasonable
hardship if the hardship is self- imposed or economic.
         d.   In determining whether or not there are special circumstances
attached to the property under subsection D2 of this section or this subsection
D3, the hearing officer may find that special circumstances exist only if the
special circumstances:
            (1)   Relate to the hardship complained of; and
            (2)   Deprive the property of privileges granted to other
properties in the same zone.
      4.   The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the
conditions justifying a variance have been met.

      6.   The hearing officer and any other body may not grant a use variance.

or modified.

The regulations contained in this chapter shall be known and may be cited as
the SIGN REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NORTH SALT LAKE CITY and its land use
management and development code. (Ord. 04-1, 2-17-2004)
10-4-2: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of sign regulations set forth in this title shall be to
coordinate the type, placement and physical dimensions of signs within the
city; to recognize the various commercial communication requirements of all
sectors of the business community; to encourage the innovative use of design;
to promote both renovation and proper maintenance; to allow for special
circumstances; and to guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate
recordkeeping and consistent enforcement. These objectives shall be
accomplished by regulation of display, erection, use and maintenance of signs.
The use and location of signs are regulated according to zoning district. The
placement and physical dimensions of signs are regulated primarily by type.
(Ord. 04-1, 2-17-2004)
   B.   Further purposes of sign regulations are to protect and promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the City residents and businesses by
regulating the design, materials, size, construction, installation, location
and maintenance of signs and sign structures in a content neutral manner that
does not favor any type of speech over another. These sign regulations minimize
potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians; to encourage signs which, by
their design, are integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites
which they occupy; to encourage sign legibility through the elimination of
excessive and confusing sign displays; to reduce driver inattention; to
preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place in which to live and
to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade; to
safeguard and enhance property values; to limit or forbid signs which interfere
with solar access of adjacent properties; to protect public and private
investment in buildings and open spaces; and to supplement and be a part of the
regulations imposed under the zoning authority of the city. (Ord. 04-1, 2-17-
2004; amd. 2012 Code; Ord. 2025-06, 4-1-2025)

In interpreting and applying the provisions of this title, the sign regulations
contained herein are declared to be the minimum standards allowable for the
purpose set forth. The types of signs allowed by this title shall be plenary
and sign types not specifically allowed as set forth within this title shall be
prohibited. It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with nor abrogate
nor annul any easement, covenant or other agreement between private parties
existing at the effective date hereof; provided, however, that where this title
imposes a greater restriction upon signs, and the location thereof requires or
imposes other conditions than those required or imposed by other laws,
ordinances or restrictions, the provisions of this title shall control. (Ord.

10-4-19: FREE SPEECH ZONE:
   A.   Establishment: The mayor, or designee, may establish a content neutral
free speech zone for any event which the establishment of a free speech zone

control or public safety on public property. All free speech zones established
shall be content neutral and appropriately marked as a free speech zone. All
free speech zones shall provide ample opportunity for protestors to communicate
their messages and be of ample size to accommodate the number of persons

zone has been designated, the City shall make available to the public at least
twenty four (24) hours before the event a map and description of the location
of the event, boundaries of the event, location of the free speech zone,
boundaries of the free speech zone, the hours of the regulations on free

vehicles or harass bystanders with physical contact. Protestors may not tie,
nail, or otherwise physically attach any banners, signs, pictures,
instructional materials, symbols, or other personal property to any City
property or private property.
   E.   Sound Amplification Devices: The City may restrict or prohibit the use
of mechanical loudspeakers or sound amplification devices in the free speech
zone, including, but not limited to, megaphones, bullhorns, and electric
amplifiers, if determined that the use of sound amplification devices will
substantially interfere with the event or will substantially interfere with
crowd control, traffic control, or public safety and that the protestors have a
reasonable opportunity to communicate their message without sound
amplification.
   F.   Penalties: A person is guilty of unlawful protest for refusing to
comply with the lawful order of the police to protest in the free speech zone
or for refusing to comply with the lawful order of the police regarding the use
of any mechanical loudspeaker or sound amplification device at an event for
which such use has been restricted or prohibited. Unlawful protest is a class C
misdemeanor, which offense is punishable by imprisonment for a term not to
exceed ninety (90) days and a fine not exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) or by both the fine and the term of imprisonment, if the offense
continues after a request by the police to desist. Otherwise, unlawful protest
is an infraction, which offense is punishable by a fine in an amount not
exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). (Ord. 2025-06, 4-1-2025)

   A.   At the time any building, structure or use is erected, enlarged,
increased or changed, off street parking shall be provided according to the
requirements of this chapter. Off street parking shall be on the same lot as
the building or use served, except in cases where conditional off site parking
facilities have been granted by the City.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to set a minimum standard for off street
parking, to ensure that ample parking for the generated demand of the use will
be available on site (off street), to avoid the necessity of parking on the
street, except in certain areas designated by the City where off street parking
requirements cannot be met by past development and redevelopment and where
other programs are in effect to mitigate the parking problem, or as may be
required and established by a conditional use permit.
   C.   All off street parking within the City shall be permanently maintained
in good condition for the duration of the uses served by the facility. (Ord.
2012-04, 2-7-2012)

shall be provided as follows:
   A.   Residential Lots: For each residential lot, not more than one access
driveway which shall be a maximum of thirty feet (30') wide at the street lot
line, or as established by conditional use permit and not to exceed forty feet
(40'). Lots with a frontage greater than one hundred feet (100') may provide
two (2) access driveways each up to fifteen feet (15') wide for circular
driveways and other special type circulation and parking.
      1.   No driveway shall be closer to a side property line than three feet
(3').
      2.   No driveway shall be closer than thirty feet (30') to the point of
the intersection of two (2) property lines at any corner of two (2) local
streets as measured along the property line, and no driveway shall extend
across such extended property line.
      3.   No driveway shall be closer than fifty feet (50') to the point of
intersection of two (2) property lines at any corner where either street is a
minor collector, major collector or minor arterial as measured along the
property lines, and no driveway shall extend across such extended property
line.
   B.   Other Than Residential Lots: For other than residential lots, access
shall be provided to meet the following requirements:
      1.   Each property shall be entitled to one driveway on each street
frontage.
      2.   Street frontages greater than two hundred feet (200') may be
permitted up to two (2) driveways, if determined by the City Engineer that the
proposed second driveway does not pose a traffic hazard or unreasonable
impediment to traffic flow.
      3.   The Planning Commission may approve additional driveway approaches
for properties with greater than four hundred feet (400') of frontage as a
conditional use. The applicant must demonstrate that an undue hardship or
unusual conditions exist on the property which justify the necessity of
additional driveways. The City Engineer must recommend approval and any
conditions of approval to the Planning Commission with a finding that the
additional driveway will not create a traffic hazard or unreasonable impediment
to traffic flow. A traffic study will be required on streets designated as
minor collector, major collector or minor arterial.
      4.   No driveway shall be closer to a side property line than eight feet
(8') except in the case of shared driveways.
      5.   The minimum spacing for multiple driveways on a single property
shall be twice the width of the driveway with the greatest width (see driveway
exhibit below).
      6.   Each driveway shall be not more than forty feet (40') wide, measured
at right angles to the centerline of the driveway, except as increased by
permissible curb return radii, or as established by conditional use permit. The
entire flare of any return radius shall fall within the right-of-way.
      7.   No driveway shall be closer than fifty feet (50') to the point of
intersection of two (2) property lines at any corner where either street is a
minor collector, major collector or minor arterial as measured along the
property line, and no driveway shall extend across such extended property line.
      8.   On a street where there are no curbs or gutters, all driveways shall
be well marked and protection provided the entire length of the frontage,
exclusive of the driveways, as per approved plans.
      9.   Where topography or other physical lot conditions do not allow for a
driveway, a shared driveway may be allowed. Both property owners must sign and
record a cross easement agreement benefiting both parties, and a copy of the
agreement must be provided to the City.
      10.   On streets which are designated as a minor arterial, major
collector, minor collector, and local streets with significant traffic flows:
As part of a site plan approval and upon recommendation of the City Engineer,
the Planning Commission may require that shared driveways be utilized for
adjoining properties, where feasible and warranted.

   C.   Determining Total Requirements For Shared Parking Facilities:
      1.   For each applicable general land use category, calculate the number
of stalls required for a use if it were the only use (refer to the schedule of
minimum off street parking requirements). Use those figures for each land use
to calculate the number of stalls required for each time period for each use (6
time periods per use). For each time period, add the number of stalls required
for all applicable land uses to obtain a grand total for each of the six (6)
time periods. Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement
and use that total as the shared parking requirement. (Ord. 2012-04, 2-7-2012)

CHAPTER 7
CONDITIONAL USES
SECTION:
10-7-1: Purpose And Intent
10-7-2: Conditional Use Permit Process
10-7-3: Performance Standards For Conditional Uses
10-7-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this chapter and the intent of the City in its adoption is to
promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the present and
future inhabitants of the City. This chapter accomplishes the aforesaid purpose
and intent by providing sufficient flexibility to allow in certain areas
compatible integration of uses which are related to the permitted uses of the
district or are of a temporary nature only, but which may be suitable and
desirable only in certain locations in that district due to conditions and
circumstances peculiar to that location or upon certain conditions which make
the uses suitable or only if such uses are designed, laid out and constructed
on the proposed site in a particular manner. While flexibility in allowing uses
which would otherwise be generally unsuitable to a given district is an
important goal of this chapter, it is also recognized that constraints on
governmental decision making are a legal imperative. This chapter, therefore,
also provides a framework of standards within which those governmental
decisions must be made. (Ord. 2024-01, 1-16-2024)
10-7-2: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCESS:
   A.   Conditional Use Permit Required: A conditional use permit shall be
required for all uses listed as conditional uses in this Title.
   B.   Preapplication Procedures: To facilitate the handling of applications,
the Community Development Department may adopt preapplication procedures to
allow for adequate investigations and staff review and may require compliance
with such preapplication review procedures as a prerequisite to formal
application and action by the Planning Commission. Preapplication review shall
in no way be interpreted to mean review by the Planning Commission.
   C.   Requirements: An application for a conditional use permit shall be
filed with the Community Development department on a form provided for such
request, and shall include the following:
      1.   Signature of the property owner or his authorized representative;
      2.   Payment of the review fee as specified in the current fee schedule;
      3.   A detailed description of the proposed use, including all pertinent
information related to the use and applicable to the conditional use including,
but not limited to:
         a.   A site plan and building floor plan detailing the area to be used
in operation of the conditional use, any onsite features existing or proposed
such as detention/retention facilities, fencing, landscaping, parking, building
footprint, or other site amenities;
         b.   A general description of the major activities associated with the
conditional use (indoor and outdoor), such as the number of employees,
equipment used, hours of operation, etc. as applicable;
         c.   A description of any disruptive impacts the conditional use may
have on properties adjacent to or in the vicinity, such as noise, chemical use
or storage, lighting, or odors;
         d.   A description of any potential health hazards to employees,
customers, or residents adjacent to or in the vicinity of the conditional use,
including potential hazards created by accidental chemical release or other
emergency;
         e.   A description of the expected traffic generated by the
conditional use such as passenger vehicles and delivery trucks, including hours
and frequency.
         f.   A description of future land uses expected on the site, such as
additional building construction and expansion of the current or proposed land
use;
         g.   A description of the expected water and sewer demand for the
conditional use;
         h.   A description of any potential environmental impacts, such as
emission, dust generation, or storm water drainage;
         i.   All proposed mitigation measures to address potential impacts
related to the conditional use;
         j.   For new construction or conditional uses which will require site
or public improvements, a concurrent site plan application is required.
   D.   Submission And Docketing For Review: Upon receipt of a complete
application, including payment of all required fees and submission of all
necessary documentation related to the proposed use, the Community Development
Director and other members of the development review staff, shall review the
application for completeness and compliance with the provisions of this Title
and other pertinent City regulations. When the Community Development Director,
or designee, determines that the application is properly prepared and ready for
submission to the Planning Commission for review, the application will be
docketed for review at the next regular public meeting of the Planning
Commission. Incomplete applications shall not be docketed for Planning
Commission review.
   E.   Action By Planning Commission:
      1.   A conditional use shall be approved if reasonable conditions are
proposed, or can be imposed, to mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental
effects of the proposed use in accordance with applicable standards.
      2.   If the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of a proposed
conditional use cannot be mitigated by the proposal or the imposition of
reasonable conditions to achieve compliance with applicable standards, the
conditional use may be denied.
   F.   Public Hearings: A public hearing may be held when deemed by the
Planning Commission to be in the public interest and shall be noticed as a
class B notice sent to any affected entities and all property owners within
three hundred feet (300') of the property boundary a minimum of ten (10)
calendar days prior to the hearing date. However, in the following instances,
the holding of a public hearing shall be mandatory:
      1.   The Planning Commission determines that existing streets and
thoroughfares are not suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic or on-
street parking demand, and increased densities resulting from the proposed use
may generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside
the district.
      2.   The Planning Commission determines that increases in miscellaneous
traffic, light, odor or environmental pollution generated by the proposed use
may significantly change the intended characteristics of the district as
outlined in this Title, or may present unsuitable safety risks to inhabitants
of the district.
      3.   The Planning Commission determines that the architectural design of
the proposed use varies significantly from the architectural characteristics of
the district (as outlined in this Title) in which such use is proposed.
   G.   Appeal: Any decision made in the administration of this chapter may be

10-10-4: LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose for landscaping is to provide for the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of the City. This objective
is to be accomplished by completing construction and development projects in
such a way as to appear completed and maintained, promote the benefits of plant
life in our ecology system, aesthetically enhance the environment, and
generally improve the inhabitability and aesthetics of the City.
   B.   Design And Installation:
      1.   In land development projects where sidewalks are installed leaving a
landscaped area between the sidewalk and curb or pavement, access sleeves in
adequate number for future irrigation systems shall be provided.
      2.   In any project where driveways or other impediments to landscaping
are installed prior to issuance of an approved landscape plan, access sleeves
in adequate number for future irrigation systems shall be provided.
   C.   Planting And Other Landscaping:
      1.   All landscaped areas shall be installed in accordance with Title 10,
Chapter 22, Water Efficient Landscape Standards.
      2.   All park strip areas within the street right-of-way shall be
landscaped.
      3.   Required front yard setback areas shall be landscaped and planted
except for required paving for driveways and sidewalks, retaining walls,
stairs, etc., unless the undisturbed natural landscaping can and will be
maintained.
      4.   Required side yard setback areas shall be landscaped and planted
except for required paving for driveways and sidewalks, retaining walls,
stairs, patio intrusions, etc.
      5.   Required rear yard setback areas shall be landscaped and planted
except for required paving for driveways and sidewalks, retaining walls,
stairs, patios, recreation apparatus and associated ground surfaces, etc.
   D.   Maintenance: All land not covered by structures and paving shall be
landscaped, planted and maintained in reasonable condition. Automatic
irrigation systems shall function to properly provide moisture to plant life.
All landscape elements shall be maintained in an orderly, free from debris,
etc., condition, including painted surfaces and other finishes, as necessary
and generally attractive. Vegetation that overgrows or overhangs travelways and
sidewalks on the street right-of-way shall be pruned or otherwise trimmed, by
the respective owner of the vegetation, as to not interfere with passage on
said travelway or sidewalk. (Ord. 03-3, 4-15-2003; amd. Ord., 7-12-2007; Ord.
2022-03, 6-7-2022)
10-10-5: HOME OCCUPATIONS:
   A.   Scope: Business activities may be conducted within a residence if such
activities comply with the standards of this section. All home occupations
shall be secondary and incidental to the residential use. A home occupation
should be conducted so that neighbors, under normal conditions, would not be
aware of its existence. Home occupations are a temporary privilege which can be
revoked if disruption of the residential neighborhood occurs.
   B.   Issuance Of Business License: The Zoning Administrator may, upon
application, issue a home occupation business license if the Administrator is
satisfied that the applicant will meet all of the conditions listed below and
that the applicant has agreed in writing to comply with all said conditions.
   C.   Conditions: Each and every one of the following conditions must be
agreed to by the applicant for a home occupation business license and observed
at all times by the holder of the license:
      1.   The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the
use of the dwelling and shall not change the appearance, character or condition
thereof. There shall be no displays, advertisements, stock in trade or signs
related to the business, except those required by State law and which meet the
provisions of this title.
      2.   Only members of the family related by blood, marriage or adoption,
and who reside in the dwelling, may work on site. The only exception is that
one additional person may be employed as a secretary, apprentice or assistant
where there are no more than five (5) family members actively engaged in the
home occupation. Employees who are not family members and/or who do not reside
at the dwelling shall not meet, park or otherwise congregate at the home or in
the general vicinity.
      3.   The home occupation shall not involve more than one room in the
dwelling and cannot exceed twenty percent (20%) of the ground floor area.
      4.   The home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the dwelling,
except for work performed off site. It shall not involve the attached garage or
carport section of the dwelling, nor any accessory garage, building or yard
space or activity outside of the main building.
      5.   The home occupation shall not involve the sale of commodities on the
premises. Commodities may be produced on the premises and sold through other
business outlets not on the premises. Items that are incidental to a service
provided may be sold on a limited basis, i.e., a beautician who also sells hair
products to clientele.
      6.   The home occupation shall not create noise, dust, odors, noxious
fumes, glare or other nuisances, including interruption of radio and/or
television reception, which are discernible beyond the premises.
      7.   The home occupation shall not create a hazard by using or storing
flammable material or explosives or other dangerous materials.
      8.   The home occupation shall not create unusual amounts of waste,
residential or otherwise.
      9.   The home occupation shall not involve the use of mechanical or
electrical apparatus, equipment or tools not commonly associated with a
residential use or as are customary to home crafts.
      10.   The home occupation shall not generate traffic in greater volumes
than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, with the
exception of daycares, preschools, and private swimming lessons, nor involve
the use of commercial vehicles other than standard delivery vehicles for
delivery of materials to or from the premises.
      11.   The home occupation shall not involve the use or parking of
equipment or motor vehicles having a gross weight of twelve thousand (12,000)
pounds or more directly at the residence. One vehicle under twelve thousand
(12,000) pounds may be used in association with the home occupation, provided
it is garaged or stored entirely within a building or structure.
      12.   The home occupation shall be in conformance with all applicable
Fire, Building, Plumbing, Electrical and Life Safety and Health Codes of the
State, the County and the City.
      13.   All home occupation business licenses shall be valid for one year
and may be renewed annually, provided there have been no reported violations,
complaints or detrimental characteristics which may, in the opinion of the
Development Review Committee, require termination of said home occupation.
      14.   Handicapped persons may obtain a waiver of one or more of these
conditions through the Planning Commission to allow such persons to become
self-sufficient.
   D.   Specific Businesses Prohibited As Home Occupations: In order to
minimize traffic and off street parking and to avoid health and sanitation
risks from the disposal of medical wastes, medical, dental and other health
professional offices are specifically excluded as home occupations. Other types
of businesses prohibited as home occupations include:
      1.   Auto, truck or motorcycle repair at the residence;
      2.   Furniture or cabinet making;

R1-12, R1-10, R1-7, MU, RM-7 and RM-20.
      2.   A child daycare business license is required prior to conducting any
business on site. The applicant must submit proof that an application has been
made to the State Department of Health with their City business license

Evaluations
10-12-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of the SA district is to designate and describe those areas
within the city that possess environmental characteristics which require
special public consideration of use applications which might affect the
structure of the land. These "sensitive land development regulations" provide
standards, guidelines and criteria, having the effect of minimizing flooding,
fire, erosion, and other natural and manmade hazards, and protect people and
property while protecting the natural scenic character of the sensitive land
areas not suitable for development, or suitable for development only after
mitigation of hazards and ensuring the efficient expenditure of public funds.
   B.   The standards, guidelines and criteria to be achieved by the SA
district overlay zone shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      1.   The protection of the public from natural and manmade hazards;
      2.   The minimizing of the threat and consequential damages of fire in
foothill areas by establishing fire protection measures;
      3.   The preservation of natural features, wildlife habitat and open
space;
      4.   The preservation of public access to mountain areas and natural
drainage channels;
      5.   The preservation and enhancement of visual and environmental quality
by use of natural vegetation and the prohibition of excessive excavation and
terracing;
      6.   The establishment of traffic circulation facilities that ensure
ingress and egress for vehicles, including emergency vehicles, into all
developed areas at any time of the year with minimal cuts, fills or visible
scars;
      7.   The encouragement of variety of development designs and concepts
that are compatible with the natural terrain of the foothill areas, that will
preserve open space and natural landscape;
      8.   The establishment of land use management criteria that will
encourage protection of natural elements while allowing a harmonious and
satisfying residential environment;
      9.   Encouragement of regard for the view of the foothills, and from the
foothills;
      10.   Determine areas in the city that, due to geologic hazards, may not
be suitable for development, and may require engineering measures to reduce the
hazards to an acceptable level.
   C.   The intent of geologic hazards regulations is to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city of North Salt Lake, protect the
city's infrastructure and financial health, and minimize adverse effects of
geologic hazards to public health, safety, and property by encouraging wise
land use.
   D.   This chapter and its appendices address surface fault rupture, slope
stability, and liquefaction hazards and present minimum standards and methods
for evaluating geologic hazards.
   E.   Results of geologic hazard studies shall comply with this chapter and
its appendices. The standards set forth in the appendices are minimum
requirements. More complex projects may require more detailed and in depth
evaluations than outlined herein. In addition, the appendices shall not
supersede other more stringent requirements that may be required by other
regulatory agents.
   F.   Site specific geologic hazard assessments performed by qualified
engineering geologists shall be required prior to developing projects located
within a sensitive area district or otherwise required areas of potential
geologic hazard. The developer shall submit the applicable study and complete
the report process as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter:
ACCEPTABLE AND REASONABLE RISK: No loss or significant injury to occupants, no
release of hazardous or toxic substances, and minimal structural damage.
ACCESSORY BUILDING: Any structure not designed for human occupancy, which may
include tool or storage sheds, gazebos, and swimming pools.
ACTIVE FAULT: A fault displaying evidence of displacement along one or more of
its traces during Holocene time, which is approximately ten thousand (10,000)
years ago to the present.
AVALANCHE: A large mass of snow, ice, soil or rock, or a mixture of these
materials, falling, sliding, or flowing rapidly under the force of gravity.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP): Activities, facilities, measures, planning or
procedures used to minimize erosion and sedimentation and manage stormwater
before, during, and after earth disturbance activities.
BUILDABLE AREA: Based on an accepted engineering geology report, the portion of
a site not impacted by geologic hazards, or the portion of a site where it is
concluded the identified geologic hazards can be mitigated to a level where
risk to human life, property and city infrastructure are reduced to an
acceptable and reasonable level and where structures may be safely sited.
CITY: The public works director, city engineer, community development director,
planning manager, building official or other city employee.
CITY COUNCIL: The city council of the city of North Salt Lake.
CRITICAL FACILITIES: Essential, hazardous, special occupancy facilities, and
occupancy categories III and IV as defined in the currently adopted
international building code, and lifelines such as major utility,
transportation, and communication facilities and their connections to critical
facilities.
DEBRIS FLOW: A slurry of rock, soil, organic material, and water transported in
an extremely fast and destructive flow that flows down channels and onto and
across alluvial fans; including a continuum of sedimentation events and
processes including debris flows, debris floods, mudflows, clear water floods,
or alluvial fan flooding.
DEVELOPMENT: All critical facilities, subdivisions, single- and multi-family
dwellings, commercial and industrial buildings; also additions to or
intensification of existing buildings, storage facilities, pipelines and
utility conveyances, and other land uses.
ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST: A Utah licensed geologist, who, through education,
training, and experience, is competent in applying geologic data, geologic
techniques, and geologic principles, which includes conducting field
investigations, so that geologic conditions and geologic factors affecting
engineered works, groundwater resources, and land use planning are recognized,
adequately interpreted, and clearly presented for use in engineering practice,
land use planning, and for the protection of the public, and who utilizes
specialized geologic training and experience to provide quantitative geologic
information and recommendations and also works with and for land use planners,
environmental specialists, architects, public policy makers, and property
owners to provide geologic information on which decisions can be made.
ENGINEERING GEOLOGY: Geologic work that is relevant to engineering and
environmental concerns, and the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineering
geology is the application of geological data, principles, and interpretation
so that geological factors affecting planning, design, construction, and
maintenance of engineered works, land use planning, and groundwater resources
are adequately recognized and properly interpreted for use in engineering, land

      4.   Installation of monitoring equipment and seasonal monitoring of
surface and subsurface geologic conditions, including groundwater levels; and
      5.   Other requirements such as time schedules for completion of the
mitigation and phasing of development.
   F.   The city of North Salt Lake may also establish additional requirements
necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens, protect
city infrastructure and financial health, and minimize potential adverse
effects of geologic hazards to public health, safety, and property as a
condition of approval of any development which requires a geologic hazards
report.
   G.   The city of North Salt Lake may require qualified professionals to be
on site, at the cost of the developer, during certain phases of construction,
particularly during grading phases and the construction of retaining walls. For
any real property where development has proceeded on the basis of a geologic or

chapter only after the city has issued a written review of a report. The appeal
shall be submitted in writing to the city recorder within ten (10) days of the
issuance of the written review or other decision and shall set forth the
specific grounds or issues upon which the appeal is based. The city shall
assemble a professional panel of three (3) qualified experts to serve as the
appeal authority for any technical dispute. The panel shall consist of an
expert designated by the city, an expert designated by the applicant, and an
expert chosen by the city's and the applicant's designated experts. If the
city's and the applicant's designated experts cannot reach a consensus of the
third expert within thirty (30) days, the city shall select the third expert.
Decisions of the panel will be binding and will be based on the majority
decision of the panel. The costs of the appeal process shall be paid by the
applicant. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)

than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) shall be supported by documentation
and a report prepared and signed by a professional engineering geologist and
geotechnical engineer attesting to the appropriateness, safety and stability of
the proposed fill. Such documentation and report shall be prepared at the
applicant's expense and shall address the need for and design of necessary
measures to provide for the safety and stability of the proposed fill.
   G.   Combined Cut And Fill Slopes: Combined cut and fill slopes shall meet
the requirements of this section insofar as steepness, height, and benching are
concerned except that, where the slope exceeds twenty five feet (25') in
height, the required drainage bench shall be placed at the top of the cut
slope.
   H.   Setback: Fill placed on or above the top of an existing or proposed cut
or natural slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3:1) shall be
set back from the top of the slope a minimum distance as required by the
international building code, as adopted by the city, or as approved by the city
engineer based upon submitted reports and documentation for the project.
   I.   Existing Fills: All existing manmade fills on any and all sites shall
be properly evaluated by a soils engineer. If deficiencies exist,
recommendations and design criteria for corrective measures shall be included
within the soils engineering report.
   J.   Measure Of Settlement: The city engineer or the building official may
require, in writing, the determination of the settlement characteristics of any
fills to establish that any movements have substantially ceased. In such cases,
a system of bench marks shall be installed by a civil engineer or land surveyor
at critical points on the fill, and accurate measurements of both horizontal
and vertical movements shall be taken and evaluated by the geotechnical
engineer for a period of time sufficient to define the settlement behavior. The
evaluation period shall be monitored in accordance with the approved
geotechnical report for the project.
   K.   Buttress Fills: All buttress fills shall be designed in accordance with
the city's construction standards and the recommendations and design criteria,
including the subdrain system, submitted by the geotechnical engineer or
engineering geologist with the approval of the city engineer.
   L.   Limitations: For all lots created after the adoption of this chapter,
the following limitations shall apply: Toes of fill slopes shall not be made
nearer to a rear property boundary line than seven feet (7'). (Ord. 2015-16,
10-20-2015)
10-12-19: EROSION CONTROL AND DRAINAGE DEVICES:
Best Management Practices, such as, but not limited to, intervening terraces,
diverter terraces, vee channels, runoff computations, drainage dispersal walls,
subdrains and site drainage, shall be provided and designed in accordance with
this chapter and any other applicable City ordinances. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-
2015)
10-12-20: AREAS SUBJECT TO SLIDES AND UNSTABLE SOIL:
A detailed evaluation shall be completed for all areas subject to slides or
unstable soils by a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist including
design criteria for corrective measures. Exploratory work or reports are
required for such conditions in accordance with geologic hazard investigation
permit requirements set forth in section
10-12-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-21: PLANTING AND IRRIGATION OF CUT AND FILL SLOPES:
All manufactured cut and fill slopes shall be planted and maintained until
established. Temporary irrigation may be required in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and any other applicable City ordinances. The
developer is responsible for operating and maintaining the irrigation system
until such time as the planted material is well established as determined, in
writing, by the City Engineer. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-22: LOT STANDARDS AND IDENTIFICATION OF BUILDING ENVELOPE:
In order to facilitate the preservation of slopes, natural terrain and
vegetation, or avoidance of geologic hazards, the minimum depth of a lot in
feet, as regulated in this title may be modified by the City Council upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission. The resulting area must contain a
"buildable area" as defined by section
10-1-47 of this title.
The developer shall indicate on the site plan and subdivision plat for the site
or project, the maximum building envelope, or area of ultimate land/vegetation
disturbance, including designation of the building envelope's distance from the
lot or site boundary lines, which will be caused by the proposed structure and
its appurtenances. Prior to the beginning of any type of land disturbance or
construction on a given lot, the contractor performing the work is responsible
for identifying the building envelope in the field by marking of the building
envelope perimeter. The building official may require markers to be surveyed
when deemed necessary or appropriate. Marking of the building envelope shall be
inspected by the City's building division prior to commencement of any land
disturbance activity on the lot. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-23: PROPERTY LINE AND CORNER MARKERS:
The developer shall ensure that property lines and corner survey markers are
installed for the site or project. These markers are to include rebar placed at
the back corners of each lot and markers placed on the curb for locating the
side property lines. If curb and gutter do not exist, the front markers are to
be placed in the road pavement. Additional survey markers may be required on
property lines as deemed necessary by the building official. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-
20-2015)
10-12-24: SLOPE PROTECTION EASEMENTS:
The developer shall provide slope protection easements for all critical slopes
(native or constructed) as part of the project. Critical slopes shall include
slopes which average thirty percent (30%) or higher for an elevation change
five feet (5') or greater. The City Engineer may declare in writing other
slopes less than thirty percent (30%) as critical slopes due to geologic
hazard, soil stability, drainage flows, vegetation conditions or designated
open space. Slope protection easements shall be provided by both indicating
them on the final plat and by separate recordable easement for each individual
lot where the easements are located. Such individual easements shall be
accompanied by a map indicating areas where land disturbance is prohibited.
Easements for individual lots shall be recorded simultaneously with the
recordation of the final subdivision plat. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-25: MASTER DRAINAGE PLAN REQUIRED:
A master drainage plan shall be designed for all proposed development. At a
minimum the plan shall address the following items:
   A.   Master Drainage Plan Design:
      1.   Drainage Plan: Applications for development shall include a plan
indicating how proposed lots will be graded and drained. This plan shall be of
sufficient detail to demonstrate how surface runoff will typically be managed
on all lots within the proposed project, including possible locations of swales
and detention or retention facilities that will be utilized to control runoff.
      2.   Notice Of Drainage Easements: A notice of drainage easements shall
be recorded on the subdivision plat for the project. The easement shall specify
that nothing may be placed within a swale easement that would diminish or
reduce functionality of the swale.
      3.   Swales: Any swale located in rear or side yards shall be designed
with materials approved by the city that will prevent erosion, and shall become
a permanent feature of the lot. The swale systems shall be shown in a drainage
easement on the site plan and final plat for the project.
      4.   Underground Facilities: The developer may select the option of
designing underground drainage facilities to replace aboveground drainage
swales if these facilities meet certain city requirements. These requirements
include the design being approved in writing by the city engineer, inclusion of
these facilities within city approved drainage easements, maintenance of the
system by a homeowners' association, and other requirements as may be deemed
necessary by the city.
      5.   Lots Graded Toward Street For Drainage: Except as otherwise provided
herein, stormwater runoff from individual lots shall be directed toward the
streets at a minimum slope of two percent (2%) for the first twenty five feet
(25') from the structure. For homes that are set back more than twenty five
feet (25') from the front property line, property may be reduced to a one
percent (1%) slope for all areas at least twenty five feet (25') from the
structure. Exceptions may be granted by the city engineer in writing, when
deemed appropriate and necessary, in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Aesthetic reasons such as the creation of view lots shall not
constitute sufficient reason for granting an exception.
      6.   Lots Which Cannot Be Graded Toward The Street; Approval Required:
Lots that cannot be drained toward the street may be allowed to drain a portion
of their stormwater runoff toward the rear of the yard after review and
approval in writing by the city engineer. Prior to obtaining this approval, the
developer shall prepare a drainage plan, which indicates how the stormwater
will be disposed of from the lot, to either a city owned storm drain, a natural
stream or channel, a manmade channel, a lower elevation lot or other city
approved facility or retained on site. Such disposal is to be protected by a
drainage easement, as described in section
10-12-27 of this chapter, dedicated for this purpose and the facilities are to
be bonded for. Drainage easements shall be maintained by the homeowners'
association, where applicable, or by individual lot owners.
In the case where stormwater flow is allowed to flow from a higher lot to a
lower lot, in elevation, sufficient energy dissipation shall be designed and
constructed to reduce the water velocity to an acceptable level to prevent
erosion. The design and construction of these energy dissipation structures
shall be approved by the engineering department in conjunction with the review
and approval of the drainage plan for the project.
   B.   Conformance To Master Drainage Plan:
      1.   Applications: Individual applications for building permits shall
include lot specific drainage plans which indicate how surface runoff will be
managed in conformance with the master drainage plan. Modifications to the
design specified in the master drainage plan shall require approval by the city
engineer.
      2.   Installation: Installation of required lot drainage improvements
shall be completed and approved prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
      3.   Maintenance: Individual lot owners shall be responsible for the
maintenance of all lot drainage improvements. Nothing may be placed within
drainage easements that would diminish or reduce functionality of the drainage
system.
      4.   Notice: The developer shall notify the homebuilders and homeowners
of the required lot drainage improvements and the homeowner's obligation to
maintain such improvements in perpetuity. The method of notice shall be
approved by the city. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-26: LANDSCAPING OF CERTAIN LOTS FOR EROSION CONTROL:
The city reserves the right to require that the lots be revegetated or
stabilized upon completion of subdivision improvements or that lots be fully
landscaped prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy as part of the
requirements of the project. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that
for certain areas in the city which have soils susceptible to severe erosion,
the erosion is controlled. The criteria to be used by the city are the size of
the lot and sizes of adjacent lots, elevation differences between lots, level
of disturbance to native soils and vegetation, the type of soils in the
project, and any other relevant factors. See Title 10, Chapter 22, Water
Efficient Landscape Standards for soil erosion requirements. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-
20-2015; amd. Ord. 2022-03, 6-7-2022)
10-12-27: EROSION CONTROL AND REVEGETATION:
The developer is to indicate erosion control and revegetation best management
practice (BMP) to be used for the project on the project drawings and as part
of the project descriptions included with the application. Erosion and
sedimentation control measures will be inspected prior to commencement of
construction, during construction of the subdivision, and once the subdivision
construction is complete. The engineering department will be responsible for
these inspections. Once the subdivision level construction is complete and
improvement work begins on individual lots, erosion and sedimentation control
BMP will be the responsibility of the lot owner and will be inspected prior to
any lot disturbance, during construction and once lot level construction is
complete. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-28: WET WEATHER PLAN:
The city engineer may require that land disturbance activities and erosion
control or revegetation plans be modified, if unforeseen delays occur due to
weather generated problems not considered at the time the land disturbance
permit was issued, including submission and approval of a wet weather plan.
(Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-29: DISCLOSURE WHEN A GEOLOGIC HAZARD REPORT IS REQUIRED:
   A.   Whenever a geologic hazards report is required under this chapter, the
owner of the parcel shall record a notice running with the land in a form
satisfactory to the city of North Salt Lake prior to the approval of any
development or subdivision of such parcel. Disclosure shall include signing a
disclosure and acknowledgment form provided by the city, which includes:
      1.   Notice that the parcel is located within a geologic hazards study
area as shown on the geologic hazards study area map or as otherwise defined in
this chapter; and
      2.   Notice that a geologic hazards report was prepared and is available
for public inspection in the city's files.
   B.   Where geologic hazards and related setbacks are delineated in a
subdivision, the owner shall also place additional notification on the plat
stating the above information prior to final approval of the plat. (Ord. 2015-
16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-30: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER:
The geologic hazards ordinance and sensitive lands overlay area map may be
amended as new information becomes available pursuant to procedures set forth
in this title. The provisions of this chapter do not in any way assure or imply
that areas outside the sensitive lands overlay maps boundary are free from the
possible adverse effects of geologic hazards. It is the responsibility of the
applicant's geotechnical consultants to employ outside research and data to
discover and establish the locations and boundaries of any known and potential
geologic hazards. This chapter shall not create any liability on the part of
the city of North Salt Lake, or any officer, reviewer, or employee thereof for
any damages from geologic hazards that result from reliance on this chapter or
any administrative requirement or decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2015-
16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-31: CHANGE OF USE:
No change in use which results in the conversion of a building or structure
from one not used for human occupancy to one that is so used shall be permitted
unless the building or structure complies with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-16, 10-20-2015)
10-12-32: CONFLICTING REGULATIONS:
In cases of conflict between the provisions of existing zoning classifications,
building code, subdivision ordinance, or any other ordinance of the city of
North Salt Lake and the sensitive area and geologic hazards ordinance codified
in this chapter, the most restrictive provision shall apply. (Ord. 2015-16, 10-
20-2015)
10-12-33: APPENDICES:
10-12-33-1: APPENDIX A, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SURFACE FAULT RUPTURE HAZARD
STUDIES:
1.0 Introduction.
The Wasatch Fault zone (WFZ) is a major tectonic feature in the western United
States, extending for about 230 miles from near Fayette, Utah at the south to
near Malad, Idaho at the north. Surface faulting has occurred along the WFZ in
northern Utah throughout late Pleistocene and Holocene time (Lund, 1990; Black
and others, 2003). "Surface faulting" is fault- related offset or displacement
of the ground surface that may occur in an earthquake.
The WFZ consists of a series of normal-slip fault segments with relative
movement down to the west and up to the east. Ten major fault segments are
recognized along the WFZ (Machette and others, 1992), which are believed to be
independent in regard to their potential for surface faulting. These segments
have distinct geomorphic expression and are clearly visible on aerial
photographs.
If a fault were to break the ground surface beneath a building, significant
damage could occur, perhaps resulting in injuries or loss of life. To ensure
that buildings are not sited across Holocene-age (active) faults, the city of
North Salt Lake municipal code, title 10, chapter 12: sensitive area & geologic
hazards ordinance requires a site-specific geologic investigation of property
situated within the sensitive lands overlay zone and any other areas that may
be subject to the presence of fault lines. The primary purposes of the geologic
investigation are to assess the surface fault rupture potential of the property
and to assess the suitability of the property for the proposed development from
the standpoint of surface fault rupture. If a fault is discovered and
determined (or presumed) to have moved during the Holocene-age ("active"),
appropriate building setbacks from the fault are required such that structures
are not located astride the fault trace. Building setbacks must be established
prior to development of sites located within the surface-fault-rupture special
study area.
A site-specific surface-fault-rupture-hazard study includes a field
investigation (usually involving the excavation and geologic documentation of a
trench) and report. This appendix describes the minimum standards required by
the city for surface-fault-rupture-hazard studies.
The purpose of establishing minimum standards for surface fault rupture hazard
studies is to:
      (a) Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of surface fault rupture and related
hazards;
      (b) Assist property owners and land developers in conducting reasonable
and adequate studies;
      (c) Provide consulting engineering geologists with a common basis for
preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and recommending building
setbacks; and,
      (d) Provide an objective framework for review of fault study reports.
The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide the developer,
consulting engineers, geologists and geotechnical engineers with an outline of
appropriate exploration methods, standardized report information, and
expectations for the report.
These standards constitute the minimum level of effort required in conducting
surface-fault-rupture-hazard studies in the city. Considering the complexity of
evaluating surface and near-surface faults, additional effort beyond the
minimum standards may be required at some sites to adequately address the fault
hazard. The information presented herein does not relieve the engineering
geologist from his/her duty to perform additional geologic or engineering
services he/she believes are necessary to assess the fault rupture potential at
a site.
1.2 Properties Requiring A Fault Investigation.
A fault study is required, prior to approval of any land use for properties
identified in
10-12-3 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code. Submittal and review of
a site-specific fault study prior to receiving a land use or building permit
from the city is required for said areas. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to retain a qualified professionals to perform the fault study and to
use the latest available data in preparing the required study.
In addition, a fault investigation may be required if on site or nearby fault-
related features are identified during the course of other geologic or
geotechnical studies performed on or near the site or during construction.
2.0 Minimum Standards For Fault Studies.
Following are the minimum standards for a comprehensive fault investigation.
Fault investigations may be reported in conjunction with other geological and
geotechnical investigations, or may be submitted separately. In addition to
these standards, all fault investigations, reports and recommendations shall
follow the latest adopted guidelines published by the Utah geological survey.
2.1 Scoping Meeting.
The developer's consultant must schedule a scoping meeting with the city to
evaluate the investigation approach. At this meeting, the consultant should
present a site plan that includes: proposed building locations (if known);
fault location(s) and orientation; and the proposed trench locations,
orientation, length, and depth (see section 2.3, fault investigation method).
The investigative approach should allow for flexibility due to unexpected site
conditions; field findings may require modifications to the work plan.
2.2 Fault Investigation Method.
Inherent in fault study methods is the assumption that future faulting will
recur along pre-existing faults and in a manner consistent with past
displacement. The focus of fault investigations is therefore to accurately
locate existing faults. If faults are documented, the investigation shall also
1) evaluate the age(s) of movement along the fault trace(s), and 2) estimate
amounts of past displacement(s), which is required in order to derive building
setbacks.
2.2.1 Previous Studies And Aerial Photograph Review.
A fault investigation shall include, at a minimum, a review of available
literature pertinent to the site and vicinity, including previous published and
unpublished geologic/soils reports, and interpretation of available stereo-
paired aerial photographs. The photographs reviewed should include more than
one set and should include pre-urbanization aerial photographs, if available.
Efforts must be made to accurately plot the locations of mapped or inferred
fault traces on the property as shown by previous studies in the area.
2.2.2 Exploration Methods.
Subsurface exploration consisting of trenching is required. The engineering
geologist shall clean and document ("log") trench exposures as described in
section 2.3.5. Existing faults may also be identified and mapped in the field
by direct observation of young, fault-related geomorphic features, and by
examination of aerial photographs. When trenching is not feasible (i.e., the
presence of shallow ground water, excessive thickness of fill, etc.),
supplemental methods such as closely spaced cone penetration test (CPT)
soundings may be employed. Such supplemental methods must be discussed with the
city prior to implementation and should be clearly described in the report.
In lieu of conventional trenching or the CPT method, an alternative subsurface
exploration program may be acceptable, depending upon site conditions. Such a
program may consist of a sufficient number of closely spaced downhole-logged
bucket- auger borings, geophysical exploration techniques, or a combination of
techniques.
When an alternative exploration program is proposed, a written description of
the proposed exploration program along with an exploration plan should be
submitted to the city for review, prior to the exploration. The plan must
include, at a minimum, a map of suitable scale showing the site limits, surface
geologic conditions within several thousand feet of the site boundary, the
location and type of the proposed alternative subsurface exploration, and the
anticipated earth materials present at depth on the site.
The actual subsurface exploration program to be used on any specific parcel
will be determined on an individual basis using the current state of technical
knowledge about the fault zone and information gained from previous exploration
on adjacent or nearby parcels. At all times, consideration must be given to
safety, and trenching should comply with all applicable safety regulations.
2.2.3 Trench Siting.
Exploratory trenches must be oriented approximately perpendicular to the
anticipated trend of known fault traces. The trenches shall provide the minimum
footage of trenching necessary to explore the portion of the property situated
in the surface-fault-rupture hazard study area, such that the potential for
surface fault rupture may be adequately assessed. When trenching to determine
if faults might affect a proposed building site, the trench should extend
beyond the building footprint at least the minimum setback distance for the
building type (see table A-1).
Test pits or potholes alone are neither adequate nor acceptable. In some
instances more than one trench may be required to cover the entire building
area, particularly if the proposed development involves more than one building.
Where feasible, trenches shall be located outside the proposed building
footprint, as the trench is generally backfilled without compaction, which
could lead to differential settlement beneath the footings. Supplemental
trenching may be required in order to: 1) further refine fault locations (or
the absence thereof); 2) accurately define building restriction areas, and/or;
3) provide additional exposures for evaluating the age of movement along the
faults.
2.2.4 Location Determination.
All trenches and fault locations must be surveyed by a registered professional
land surveyor. Fault locations should be surveyed with an accuracy of about 0.1
foot or better, so that structural setbacks can be developed.
2.2.5 Depth Of Excavation.
The depth of the trenches will ultimately depend on the trench location,
occurrence of ground water, stability of subsurface deposits, and the geologic
age of the subsurface geologic units. As a minimum, however, trenches shall
extend substantially below the A and B soil horizons and well into distinctly
bedded Pleistocene-age materials, if possible. Where possible, the trenches
should extend below Holocene deposits and should expose contacts between
Holocene materials and the underlying older materials.
Appropriate safety measures pertaining to trench safety for ingress, egress,
and working in or in the vicinity of the trench must be implemented and
maintained. It is the responsibility of the person in the field directing
trench excavation to ensure that fault trenches are excavated in compliance
with current occupational safety and health administration excavation safety
regulations.
Trench backfilling methods and procedures should be documented in order to
establish whether additional corrective excavation, backfilling, and compaction
should be performed at the time of site grading.
In cases where Holocene (i.e., active) faults may be present, but pre-Holocene
deposits are below the practical limit of excavation, the trenches must extend
at least through sediments that are clearly older than several fault recurrence
intervals. The practical limitations of the trenching must be acknowledged in
the report and recommendations must reflect resulting uncertainties.
2.2.6 Documenting Trench Exposures.
Trench walls shall be cleaned of debris and backhoe smear prior to
documentation. Trench logs shall be carefully drawn in the field at a minimum
scale of 1-inch equals 5-feet (1:60) following standard and accepted fault
trench investigation practices. Vertical and horizontal control must be used
and shown on trench logs. Trench logs must document all significant geologic
information from the trench and should graphically represent the geologic units
observed; see section 2.6.3(e). The strike, dip, and net vertical displacement
(s) (or minimum displacement(s)) of faults must be noted. Photographs with
appropriate scale information must be included in the trench documentation.
2.2.7 Age Dating.
The geologist shall interpret the ages of geologic units exposed in the trench.
When necessary, radiocarbon or other age determinations methods shall be used.
If evidence of faulting is documented, efforts shall be made to date the time
of latest movement (to determine whether recent (Holocene) displacement has
occurred) using appropriate geologic and/or soil stratigraphic dating
techniques. If soil stratigraphic dating techniques are used, a geologist
experienced in using the techniques and soil-development rates in the area
shall perform them.
Many of the surficial deposits within Salt Lake Valley area were deposited
during the last pluvial lake cycle, referred to as the Bonneville lake cycle.
Although late-stage Bonneville lake cycle sediments do not correspond to the
Pleistocene- Holocene boundary (i.e., Bonneville lake cycle deposits are older
than 10,000 years old), for purposes of evaluating fault activity, these
deposits provide a useful regional datum (particularly so when the entire
Holocene sequence of sediments is not present).
For practical purposes, and due to documented Holocene displacement along the
Salt Lake segment of the Wasatch fault, any fault which displaces late-stage
Bonneville lake cycle deposits should be considered active unless the
Bonneville deposits are overlain by clearly unfaulted early Holocene-age
deposits. Conversely, the presence of demonstrably unbroken, undeformed, and
stratigraphically continuous Bonneville sediments constitutes reasonable
geologic evidence for the absence of active faulting.
2.3 Field Review.
A field review by the city is required during exploratory trenching. The
applicant must provide a minimum of 48-hours notice to schedule the field
review with the city. The trenches should be open, safe, cleaned, and a
preliminary log completed at the time of the review. The field review allows
the city to evaluate the subsurface data (i.e., age, type of sediments;
presence/absence of faulting, etc.) with the consultant. Discussions about
questionable features or an appropriate setback distance are encouraged, but
the city will not help log the trench, explain the stratigraphy, or give verbal
approval of the proposed development during the field review.
2.4 Recommendations For Fault Setbacks.
To address wide discrepancies in fault setback recommendations, the city has
adopted the fault setback calculation methodology for normal faults of
Christenson and others (2003). The consultant should use this method to
establish the recommended fault setback for critical facilities and structures
designed for human occupancy. If another fault setback method is used, the
consultant must provide justification in the report for the method used. Faults
and fault setbacks must be clearly identified on site plans and maps.
Minimum setbacks are based on the type and occupancy of the proposed structures
(see table A-1). A setback should be calculated using the formulas presented
below, and then compared to the minimum setback established in table A-1. The
greater of the two shall be used as the setback. Minimum setbacks apply to both
the hanging wall and footwall blocks.
Top of slope and/or toe of slope setbacks required by the local building code
must also be considered; again, the greater setback must be used.
Downthrown Fault Block (Hanging Wall)
The fault setback for the downthrown block will be calculated using the
following formula: S = U (2D + F/tan.) where:
 
S    = Setback within which structures for human occupancy are not permitted
U    = Criticality factor, based on the proposed occupancy of the structure
       (see table A-1)
D    = Expected fault displacement per event (assumed to be equal to the net
       vertical displacement measured for each past event)
F    = Maximum depth of footing or subgrade portion of the building
tan. = Dip of the fault (degrees)
 
Upthrown Fault Block (Footwall)
The dip of the fault and depth of the subgrade portion of the structure are
irrelevant in calculating the setback on the upthrown fault block. Therefore,
the setback for the upthrown side of the fault will be calculated as:
S = U x 2D
The setback is measured from the portion of the building closest to the fault,
whether subgrade or above grade. Minimum setbacks apply as discussed above.
2.5 Small Displacement Faults.
Small-displacement faults are not categorically exempt from setback
requirements. Some faults having less than 4 inches (100 mm) of displacement
("small displacement faults") may be exempt from setback requirements.
Specific structural risk-reduction options such as foundation reinforcement may
be acceptable for some small-displacement faults in lieu of setbacks.
Structural options must minimize structural damage.
Fault studies must still identify faults and fault displacements (both net
vertical displacements and horizontal extension across the fault or fault
zone), and consider the possibility that future displacement amounts may exceed
past amounts. If structural risk-reduction measures are proposed for small
displacement faults, the following criteria must be addressed:
      (a) Reasonable geologic data indicating that future surface displacement
along the particular fault will not exceed 4 inches.
      (b) Specific structural mitigation to minimize structural damage.
      (c) A structural engineer must provide appropriate designs and the city
shall review the designs.
2.6 Required Outline For Surface Fault Rupture Hazard Studies.
The information described herein may be presented as a separate surface-fault-
rupture-potential report or it may be incorporated within other geology or
engineering reports that may be required for the property.
The report shall contain a conclusion regarding the potential risk of surface
fault rupture on the subject property and a statement addressing the
suitability of the proposed development from a surface-fault-rupture-hazard
perspective. If exploration determines that there is a potential for surface
rupture due to faulting, or if gradational contacts or other uncertainties
associated with the exploration methods preclude the determination of absence
of small fault offsets, the report should provide estimates of the amplitude of
fault offsets that might affect habitable structures.
Surface-fault-rupture-hazard reports submitted to the city are expected to
follow the outline and address the subjects presented below. However,
variations in site conditions may require that additional items be addressed,
or permit some of the subjects to be omitted (except as noted).
2.6.1 Report.
      (a) Purpose And Scope Of Work: The report shall contain a clear and
concise statement of the purpose of the investigation and the scope of work
performed for the investigation.
      (b) Geologic And Tectonic Setting: The report shall contain a clear and
concise statement of the general geologic and tectonic setting of the site
vicinity. The section should include a discussion of active faults in the area,
paleoseismicity of the relevant fault system(s), and should reference relevant
published and unpublished geologic literature.
      (c) Site Description And Conditions: The report shall include information
on geologic units, graded and filled areas, vegetation, existing structures,
and other factors that may affect site development, choice of investigative

feet.
The report must describe the criteria used to evaluate the ages of the deposits
encountered in the trench, and clearly evaluate the presence or absence of
active (Holocene) faulting.

confirm the lack of faulting at the building site.
2.6.2 Report References.
Reports must include citations of literature and records used in the study,
referenced aerial photographs or images interpreted (air-photo source, date and
flight number, scale), and any other sources of data and information, including
well logs, personal communications, etc.
2.6.3 Illustrations.
At a minimum, reports must include the following illustrations:
      (a) Location Map: A site location map depicting topographic and
geographic features and other pertinent data. Generally a 1:24,000-scale USGS
topographic base map will suffice.
      (b) Geologic Map: A regional-scale map (1:24,000 to 1:50,000 scale) is
generally adequate. Depending on site complexity, a site-scale geologic map (1
inch = 200 ft or more detailed) may also be necessary. The map should show
Quaternary and bedrock geologic units, faults, seeps or springs, soil or
bedrock slumps, and other geologic and soil features existing on and adjacent
to the project site. Geologic cross-sections may be included as needed to
illustrate 3-dimensional relationships.
      (c) Site Plan: A detailed site plan is required. The site plan should be

show site boundaries, proposed building footprints, existing structures,
streets, slopes, drainages, exploratory trenches, boreholes, test pits,
geophysical traverses, and any other pertinent data.
      (d) Site Specific Fault Map: If faulting is documented at a parcel, the
report shall include a site-specific fault map. The fault map should be at a
scale of at least 1 inch = 200 feet and should clearly show the surveyed
locations of trenches (and any other exploratory techniques), surveyed location
(s) of faults documented in the trenches, inferred location of the faults
between trenches, recommended fault setback distance on each side of the
faults, topographic contours, and proposed building locations, if known.
      (e) Exploratory Trench Logs: Trench logs are required for each trench
excavated as part of the study. Trench logs shall accurately depict all
observed geologic features and conditions. Trench logs shall not be generalized
or diagrammatic. The minimum scale is 1 inch = 5 feet (1:60) with no vertical
exaggeration. Trench logs must accurately reflect the features observed in the
trench (see section 2.3.6).
Trench logs shall include: trench orientation and indication of which trench
wall was logged; trench top and bottom; stratigraphic contacts; stratigraphic
unit descriptions including lithology, USGS soil classification, genesis
(geologic origin), age, and contact descriptions; soil (pedogenic) horizons;
marker beds; and deformation or offset of sediments, faults, and fissures.
Other features of tectonic significance such as buried scarp free-faces,
colluvial wedges, in-filled soil cracks, drag folds, rotated clasts,
lineations, and liquefaction features including dikes, sand blows, etc. should
also be shown. Interpretations of the age and origin of the deposits and any
faulting or deformation must be included, based on depositional sequence. Fault
orientation and geometry (strike and dip), and amount of net displacement must
be measured and noted.
      (f) Exploratory Boreholes And CPT Soundings: Should boreholes or CPT
soundings be utilized as part of the investigation, reports shall include the
logs of the borings/soundings. Borehole logs must include lithology

the classification scheme), sample intervals, penetrative resistance values,
static ground-water depths and dates measured, total depth of borehole, and
identity of the person logging the borehole. Electronic copies of CPT data
files should be provided to the city's reviewer, upon request.
      (g) Geophysical Data: All geophysical data, showing stratigraphic
interpretations and fault locations, must be included in the report, along with
correlations to trench or borehole logs to confirm interpretations.
      (h) Photographs: Photographs of scarps, trench walls, or other features
that enhance understanding of site conditions and fault-related conditions
shall be included. Composited, rectified digital photographs of trench walls
may be used as background for trench logs, but features as outlined in section
(e) above must still be delineated.

10-12-33-2: APPENDIX B, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS:
1.0 Introduction.
The procedures outlined herein are intended to provide consultants with a
general outline for performing quantitative slope stability analyses and to
clarify the expectations of the city of North Salt Lake. These standards
constitute the minimum level of effort required in conducting quantitative
slope stability analyses in the city of North Salt Lake. Considering the
complexity inherent in performing slope stability analyses, additional effort
beyond the minimum standards presented herein may be required at some sites to
adequately address slope stability. The information presented herein does not
relieve consultants of their duty to perform additional geologic or engineering
analyses they believe are necessary to assess the stability of slopes at a
site.
The evaluation of landslides generally requires quantitative slope stability
analyses. Therefore, the standards presented herein are directly applicable to
landslide investigations, and also constitute the minimum level of effort when
performing landslide investigations.
The purposes for establishing minimum standards for slope stability analyses
are to:
      (a) Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of unstable slopes and related
hazards;
      (b) Assist property owners and land developers in conducting reasonable
and adequate studies;
      (c) Provide consulting geologists and geotechnical engineers with a
common basis for preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and
mitigation; and,
      (d) Provide an objective framework for regulatory review of slope
stability reports.
1.2 Areas Requiring Slope Stability Analyses.
Slope stability analyses shall be performed for all sites located within the
sensitive lands overlay zone and for all slopes that may be affected by the
proposed development which meet the following criteria:
      (a) Cut and/or fill slopes steeper than about 2 horizontal (h) to 1
vertical (v).
      (b) Natural slopes steeper than or equal to 3 horizontal (h) to 1
vertical (v).
      (c) Natural and cut slopes with potentially adverse geologic conditions
(e.g., bedding, foliation, or other structural features that are potentially
adverse to the stability of the slope).
      (d) Natural and cut slopes which include a geologic hazard such as a
landslide, irrespective of the slope height or slope gradient.
      (e) Buttresses and stability fills.
      (f) Cut, fill, or natural slopes of water-retention basins or flood-
control channels.
      (g) In hillside areas, investigations shall address the potential for
surficial instability, debris/mudflows, rock falls, and soil creep on all
slopes that may affect the proposed development or be affected by the proposed
development.
      (h) When evaluating site conditions to determine the need for slope
stability analyses, off-property conditions shall be considered (both up-slope
to the top(s) of adjacent ascending slopes and down-slope to and beyond the toe
(s) of adjacent descending slopes). Also, the consultant shall demonstrate that
the proposed hillside development will not affect adjacent sites or limit
adjacent property owners' ability to develop their sites.
1.3 Roles Of Geologist And Engineering Consultant.
The investigation of the static and seismic stability of slopes is an
interdisciplinary practice. To provide greater assurance that the hazards are
properly identified, assessed, and mitigated, involvement of both a geologist
and geotechnical engineer is required. Analyses shall be performed only by or
under the direct supervision of licensed professionals, qualified and competent
in their respective area of practice. A geologist shall provide appropriate
input to the geotechnical engineer with respect to the potential impact of the
geology, stratigraphy, and hydrologic conditions on the stability of the slope.
The shear strength and other geotechnical earth material properties shall be
evaluated by the geotechnical engineer. Qualified geologists, geological
engineers and geotechnical engineers may assess and quantitatively evaluate
slope stability. However, the geotechnical engineer shall perform all design
stability calculations. Ground motion parameters for use in seismic stability
analysis may be provided by either an engineering geologist or geotechnical
engineer.
1.4 Minimum Qualifications Of The Licensed Professional.
Slope stability analyses must be performed by qualified geologists and
qualified geotechnical engineers (see sections
10-12-5 and
10-12-6 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code).
2.0 General Requirements.
Except for the derivation of the input ground motion for pseudostatic and
seismic deformation analyses (see section 12), slope stability analyses and
evaluations should be performed in general accordance with the latest version
of Recommended Procedures For Implementation Of DMG Special Publication 117,
Guidelines For Analyzing And Mitigating Landslide Hazards In California (Blake
et al., 2002). In addition to these standards, all slope stability analyses,
reports and recommendations shall follow the latest adopted guidelines
published by the Utah geological survey. Procedures for developing input ground
motions to be used in the city of North Salt Lake are described in section
12.1. See title 10, chapter 12 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code,
sensitive area district & geologic hazards ordinance, for supplemental
requirements.
3.0 Submittals.
Submittals for review shall include boring logs; geologic cross sections;
trench and test pit logs; laboratory data (particularly shear strength test
results, including individual stress-deformation plots from direct shear
tests); discussions pertaining to how idealized subsurface conditions and shear
strength parameters used for analyses were developed; analytical results,
including computer output files (if requested); and summaries of the slope
stability analyses and conclusions regarding slope stability.
Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic
cross sections and must be utilized by the geotechnical engineer for the slope
stability analyses. If on-site sewage or storm water disposal exists or is
proposed, the slope stability analyses shall include the effects of the
effluent plume on slope stability.
The results of any slope stability analyses must be submitted with pertinent
backup documentation (i.e., calculations, computer output, etc.). Printouts of
input data, output data (if requested), and graphical plots must be submitted
for each computer-aided slope stability analysis. In addition, data files,
recorded on diskettes, CDs, or other electronic media may be requested to
facilitate the city's review.
4.0 Factors Of Safety.
The minimum acceptable static factor of safety is 1.5 for both gross and
surficial slope stability. The minimum acceptable factor of safety for a
calibrated pseudostatic analysis is 1.0 using the method of Stewart and others
(2003) (see section 12.2).
5.0 Landslides.
The evaluation of landslides generally requires quantitative slope stability
analyses. Therefore, the standards presented herein are directly applicable to
landslide investigation, and also constitute the minimum level of effort when
performing landslide investigations. Evaluation of landslides shall be
performed in the preliminary phase of hillside developments. Where landslides
are present or suspected, sufficient subsurface exploration will be required to
determine the basic geometry and stability of the landslide mass and the
required stabilization measures. The depth of geologic exploration shall
consider the regional geologic structure, the likely failure mode of the
suspected failure, and past geomorphic conditions.
6.0 Site Investigation And Geologic Studies.
Adequate evaluation of slope stability for a given site requires thorough and
comprehensive geologic and geotechnical engineering studies. These studies are
a crucial component in the evaluation of slope stability. Geologic mapping and
subsurface exploration are normal parts of field investigation. Samples of
earth materials are routinely obtained during subsurface exploration for
geotechnical testing in the laboratory to determine the shear strength
parameters and other pertinent engineering properties.
In general, geologic studies for slope stability consist of the following
fundamental phases:
      (a) Study and review of published and unpublished geologic information
(both regional and site specific).
      (b) Review and interpretation of available stereoscopic and oblique
aerial photographs, DEMs, and LiDAR.
      (c) Geologic field mapping, including, but not necessarily limited to,
measurement of bedding, foliation, fracture, and fault attitudes and other
parameters.
      (d) Documentation and evaluation of subsurface groundwater conditions
(including effects of seasonal and longer-term natural fluctuations as well as
landscape irrigation), surface water, on-site sewage disposal, and/or storm
water disposal.
      (e) Subsurface exploration.
      (f) Analysis of the geologic failure mechanisms that could occur at the
site (e.g., mode of failure and construction of the critical geologic cross
sections).
      (g) Presentation and analysis of the data, including an evaluation of the
potential impact of geologic conditions on the project.
      (h) Installation of piezometers in all borings to define the depth to
groundwater. The groundwater regime shall be defined geologically.
Geologic/geotechnical reports shall demonstrate that each of these phases has
been adequately performed and that the information obtained has been considered
and logically evaluated for quality and applicability to the study. Minimum
criteria for the performance of each phase are described and discussed in Blake
and others (2002).
7.0 Subsurface Exploration.
The purpose of subsurface exploration is to identify potentially significant
geologic materials, structures and hydrologic conditions at a site and to
provide samples for detailed laboratory characterization of materials from
potentially critical zones. Subsurface exploration is almost always required
and may be performed by a number of widely known techniques such as bucket-
auger borings, conventional small-diameter borings, cone penetration testing
(CPT), test pits, trenches, and/or geophysical techniques (see section 4.2 of
Blake et al., 2002). A discussion of the applicability of some subsurface
exploration techniques follows.
7.1 Trenching.
Subsurface exploration consisting of trenching has proven, in some cases, to be
necessary when uncertainty exists regarding whether or not a particular
landform is a landslide. Care must be exercised with this exploration method
because landslides characteristically contain relatively large blocks of intact
geologic units, which in a trench exposure could give the false impression that
the geologic unit is "in-place." Although limited to a depth of about 15 feet
below existing grades, trenching has also proven to be a useful technique for
verifying margins of landslides, although the geometry of a landslide can
generally be readily determined from evaluation of stereoscopic aerial
photographs. Once a landslide is identified, conventional subsurface
exploration drilling techniques will be required (see section 7.2 and 7.3).
Slope stability analyses based solely on data obtained from trenches will not
be accepted.
7.2 Methods For Bedded Formations.
Conventional subsurface exploration techniques involving continuous core
drilling with an oriented core barrel, test pits, and deep bucket-auger borings
may be used to assess the subsurface soil and geologic conditions, particularly
for geologic units with inclined bedding that includes weak layers.
Particular attention must be paid to the presence or absence of weak layers
(e.g., clay, claystone, silt, shale, or siltstone units) during the
exploration. Unless adequately demonstrated (through comprehensive and detailed
subsurface exploration) that weak (clay, claystone, silt, shale, or siltstone)
layers (even as thin as 1/16-inch or less) are not present, a weak layer shall
be assumed to possibly occur anywhere in the stratigraphic profile (i.e.,
ubiquitous weak clay beds).
The depth of the subsurface exploration must be sufficient to assess the
conditions at or below the level of the deepest potential failure surface
possessing a factor of 1.5 or less. A preliminary slope stability analysis may
need to be performed to assist in the planning of the subsurface exploration
program.
7.3 Other Geologic Units.
For alluvium, fill materials, or other soil units that do not contain weak
interbeds, other exploration methods such as small-diameter borings (e.g.,
rotary wash or hollow-stem- auger) or cone penetration testing may be suitable.
8.0 Soil Parameters.
Soil properties, including unit weight and shear strength parameters (cohesion
and friction angle), may be based on conventional field and laboratory tests as
well as on field performance. Where appropriate (i.e., for landslide slip
surfaces, along bedding planes, for surficial stability analyses, etc.),
laboratory tests for saturated, residual shear strengths must be performed.
Estimation of the shear resistance along bedding (or landslide) planes normally
requires an evaluation of saturated residual along-bedding- strength values of
the weakest interbedded (or slide-plane) material encountered during the
subsurface exploration, or in the absence of sufficient exploration, the
weakest material that may be present, consistent with site geologic conditions.
Strength parameters derived solely from CPT data may not be appropriate for
slope-stability analysis in some cases, particularly for strengths along
existing slip surfaces where residual strengths have developed. Additional
guidance on the selection of strength parameters for slope stability analyses
is contained in Blake et al. (2002).
8.1 Residual Shear Strength Parameters.
Residual strength parameters may be determined using the direct shear or ring
shear testing apparatus; however ring shear tests are preferred. If performed
properly, direct shear test results may approach ring-shear test results. The
soil specimen must be subjected to a sufficient amount of deformation (e.g., a
significant number of shearing cycles in the direct shear test or a significant
amount of rotation in the ring shear test) to assure that residual strength has
been developed. In the direct-shear and ring-shear tests, stress- deformation
curves can be used to determine when a sufficient number of cycles of shearing
have been performed by showing that no further significant drop in shear
strength results with the addition of more cycles or more rotation. The stress-
deformation curves obtained during the shear tests must be submitted with the
other laboratory test results. It shall be recognized that for most clayey
soils, the residual shear strength envelope is curved and passes through the
origin (i.e., at zero normal stress there is zero shear strength). Any
"apparent shear strength" increases resulting from a non- horizontal shear
surface (i.e., ramping) or "bulldozing" in residual direct shear tests shall be
discounted in the interpretation of the strength parameters.
8.2 Interpretation.
The consultant will need to use considerable judgment in the selection of
appropriate shear test methods and in the interpretation of the results to
develop shear strength parameters commensurate with slope stability conditions
to be evaluated. Scatter plots of shear strength data may need to be presented
to allow for assessment of idealized parameters. The report shall summarize
shear strength parameters used for slope stability analyses and describe the
methodology used to interpret test results and estimate those parameters.
Peak shear strengths may be used to represent across-bedding failure surfaces
or compacted fill, in situations where strength degradations are not expected
to occur (see guidelines in Blake et al., 2002). Where peak strengths cannot be
relied upon, fully softened (or lower) strengths shall be used.
Ultimate shear strength parameters shall be used in static slope stability
analyses when there has not been past deformation. Residual shear strength
parameters shall be used in static slope stability analyses when there has been
past deformation.
Averaged strength parameters may be appropriate for some across-bedding
conditions, if sufficient representative samples have been carefully tested.
Analyses for along-bedding or along-existing-landslide slip surfaces shall be
based on lower-bound interpretations of residual shear strength parameters and
comparison of those results to correlations, such as those of Stark and others
(2005).
8.3 Default Soil Parameters.
Failure surfaces for known landslides commonly occur within Tertiary volcanics.
Those failure surfaces typically are along clay layers formed by the in situ
alteration of volcanic tuff deposits. In cases when the failure surface has
been sampled and tested, relatively low residual-shear-strength values have
been obtained; these values are cohesion equal to 0 psf and a friction angles
equal to 11 to 12 degrees.
To assist in understanding shear strengths of these materials, the following
shear strength parameters for landslide failure surfaces and along weak layers
within the Tertiary volcanics shall be used; cohesion equal to 0 psf and a
friction angle equal to 11 degrees, unless otherwise demonstrated. Similar
values have been reported from the Springhill landslide in North Salt Lake that
is in a similar tuffaceous volcanic formation of Tertiary age. If site-specific
testing produces lower residual shear strength than these values, the site-
specific test results should be used. If site-specific testing produces higher
values, documentation must be provided to demonstrate that the weakest
materials were retrieved and tested and that the materials retrieved truly
represent the basal landslide slip surface.
9.0 Soil Creep.
The potential effects of soil creep shall be addressed where any proposed
structure is planned in close proximity to an existing fill slope or natural
slope. The potential effects on the proposed development shall be evaluated and
mitigation measures proposed, including appropriate setback recommendations.
Setback recommendations shall consider the potential effects of creep forces.
All reports in hillside areas shall address the potential for surficial
instability, and soil creep on all slopes that may affect the proposed
development or be affected by the proposed development. Stability of slopes
along planned or existing access roads shall be addressed.
10.0 Gross Static Stability.
Gross stability includes rotational and translational deep- seated failures of
slopes or portions of slopes existing within or outside of but potentially
affecting the proposed development. The following guidelines, in addition to
those in the Blake and others (2002) document, shall be followed when
evaluating slope stability:
      (a) Stability shall be analyzed along cross sections depicting the most
adverse conditions (e.g., highest slope, most adverse bedding planes,
shallowest likely ground water table, and steepest slope). Often analyses are
required for different conditions and for more than one cross section to
demonstrate which condition is most adverse. When evaluating the stability of
an existing landslide, analyses must also address the potential for partial
reactivation. Inclinometers may be used to help determine critical failure
surfaces and, along with high-resolution GPS, the state of activity of existing
landslides. The critical failure surfaces on each cross- section shall be
identified, evaluated, and plotted on the large-scale cross section.
      (b) If the long-term, static factor of safety is less than 1.5,
mitigation measures will be required to bring the factor of safety up to the
required level or the project may be redesigned to achieve a minimum factor of
safety of 1.5.
      (c) The temporary stability of excavations shall be evaluated and
mitigation measures shall be recommended as necessary to obtain a minimum
factor of safety of 1.3.
      (d) Long-term stability shall be analyzed using the highest known or
anticipated groundwater level based upon a groundwater assessment performed
under the requirements of section 6.0.
      (e) Where back-calculation is appropriate, shear strengths utilized for
design shall be no higher than the lowest strength computed using back
calculation. If a consultant proposes to use shear strengths higher than the
lowest back- calculated value, justification shall be required. Assumptions
used in back-calculations regarding pre-sliding topography and groundwater
conditions at failure must be discussed and justified.
      (f) Reports shall describe how the shear strength testing methods used
are appropriate in modeling field conditions and long-term performance of the
subject slope. The utilized design shear strength values shall be justified
with laboratory test data and geologic descriptions and history, along with
past performance history, if available, of similar materials.
      (g) Reports shall include shear strength test plots consisting of normal
stress versus shear resistance (failure envelope). Plots of shear resistance
versus displacement shall be provided for all residual and fully softened
(ultimate) shear tests.
      (h) The degree of saturation for all test specimens shall be reported.
Direct shear tests on partially saturated samples may grossly overestimate the
cohesion that can be mobilized when the material becomes saturated in the
field. This potential shall be considered when selecting shear strength
parameters. If the rate of shear displacement exceeds 0.005 inches per minute,
the consultant shall provide data to demonstrate that the rate is sufficiently
slow for drained conditions.
      (i) Shear strength values higher than those obtained through site-
specific laboratory tests generally will not be accepted.
      (j) If direct shear or triaxial shear testing is not appropriate to model
the strength of highly jointed and fractured rock masses, the design strengths
shall be evaluated in a manner that considers overall rock mass quality and be
consistent with rock mechanics practice.
      (k) Shear strengths used in slope stability analyses shall be evaluated
considering the natural variability of engineering characteristics inherent in
earth materials. Multiple shear tests on each site material are likely to be
required.
      (l) Direct shear tests do not always provide realistic strength values
(Watry and Lade, 2000). Correlations between liquid limit, percent clay
fraction, and strength (fully softened and residual) with published data (e.g.,
Stark and McCone, 2002) shall be performed to verify tested shear strength
parameters. Strength values used in analyses that exceed those obtained by the
correlation must be appropriately justified.
      (m) Shear strengths for proposed fill slopes shall be evaluated using
samples mixed and remolded to represent anticipated field conditions.
Confirming strength testing may be required during grading.
      (n) Where bedding planes are laterally unsupported on slopes, potential
failures along the unsupported bedding planes shall be analyzed. Similarly,
stability analyses shall be performed where bedding planes form a dip-slope or
near-dip-slope using composite potential failure surfaces that consist of
potential slip surfaces along bedding planes in the upper portions of the slope
in combination with slip surfaces across bedding planes in the lower portions
of the slope.
      (o) The stability analysis shall include the effect of expected maximum
moisture conditions on soil unit weight.
      (p) For effective stress analyses, measured groundwater conditions must
be adjusted to consider likely unfavorable conditions with respect to
anticipated future groundwater levels, seepage, or pore pressure and included
in the slope stability analyses.
      (q) Tension crack development shall be considered in the analyses of
potential failure surfaces. The height and location of the tension crack shall
be determined by searching.
      (r) Anticipated surcharge loads as well as external boundary pressures
from water shall be included in the slope stability evaluations, as deemed
appropriate.
      (s) Analytical chart solutions may be used provided they were developed
for conditions similar to those being analyzed. Generally though, computer-
aided searching techniques shall be used, so that the potential failure surface
with the lowest factor of safety can be located. Examples of typical searching
techniques are illustrated on figures 9.1a through 9.1f in Blake and others
(2002). However, verification of the reasonableness of the analytical results
is the responsibility of the geotechnical engineer and/or engineering
geologist.
      (t) The critical potential failure surface used in the analysis may be
composed of circles, wedges, planes, or other shapes considered to yield the
minimum factor of safety most appropriate for the geologic site conditions. The
critical potential failure surface having the lowest factor of safety with
respect to shearing resistance must be sought. Both the lowest factor of safety
and the critical failure surface shall be documented.
11.0 Surficial Stability Of Slopes.
Surficial slope stability refers to slumping and sliding of near-surface
sediments and is most critical during the snowmelt and rainy season or when
excessive landscape water is applied. The assessment of surficial slope
stability shall be based on analysis procedures for stability of an infinite
slope with seepage parallel to the slope surface or an alternate failure mode
that would produce the minimum factor of safety. The minimum acceptable depth
of saturation for surficial stability evaluation shall be four feet.
11.1 Applicability And Procedures.
Conclusions shall be substantiated with appropriate data and analyses. Residual
shear strengths comparable to actual field conditions shall be used in
completing surficial stability analyses. Surficial stability analyses shall be
performed under rapid draw-down conditions where appropriate (e.g., for debris
and detention basins).
Where 2:1 or steeper slopes have soil conditions that can result in the
development of an infinite slope with parallel seepage, calculations shall be
performed to demonstrate that the slope has a minimum static factor of safety
of 1.5, assuming a fully saturated 4-foot thickness. If conditions will not
allow the development of a slope with parallel seepage, surficial slope
stability analyses may not be required (provided the geologic/geotechnical
reviewer concurs).
Surficial slope stability analyses shall be performed for fill, cut, and
natural slopes assuming an infinite slope with seepage parallel to the slope
surface or other failure mode that would yield the minimum factor of safety
against failure. A suggested procedure for evaluating surficial slope stability
is presented in Blake et al. (2002).
11.2 Soil Properties.
Soil properties used in surficial stability analyses shall be determined as
noted in section 8.1. Residual shear strength parameters for surficial slope
stability analyses shall be developed for a stress range that is consistent
with the near- surface conditions being modeled. As indicated in section 8.1,
it shall be recognized that for most clayey soils, the residual shear strength
envelope is curved and passes through the origin (i.e., at zero normal stress
there is zero shear strength). For sites with deep slip surfaces, the
guidelines given by Blake and others (2002) should be followed.
11.3 Seepage Conditions.
The minimum acceptable vertical depth for which seepage parallel to the slope
shall be applied is four feet for cut or fill slopes. Greater depths may be
necessary when analyzing natural slopes that have significant thicknesses of
loose surficial material.
12.0 Seismic Slope Stability.
In addition to static slope stability analyses, slopes shall be evaluated for
seismic slope stability as well. Acceptable methods for evaluating seismic
slope stability using calibrated pseudo-static limit-equilibrium procedures and
simplified methods (e.g., those based on Newmark, 1965) to estimate permanent
seismic slope movements are summarized in Blake and others (2002) also Bray,
J.D. and Travasarou, T. (2007) "Simplified Procedure For Estimating Earthquake
Induced Deviatoric Slope Displacements" Journal Of Geotechnical And
Geoenvironmental Engineering, April 2007, vol. 133, no. 4, pp. 381-392.
Nonlinear, dynamic finite element/finite difference numerical methods also may
be used to evaluate slope movements resulting from seismic events as long as
the procedures, input data, and results are thoroughly documented, and deemed
acceptable by the city.
12.1 Ground Motion For Pseudostatic And Seismic Deformation Analyses.
In regards to defining ground accelerations for seismic slope- stability
analyses, the city of North Salt Lake prefers a probabilistic approach to
determining the likelihood that different levels of ground motion will be
exceeded at a particular site within a given time period. In order to more
closely represent the seismic characteristics of the WFZ and better capture
this possible high likelihood of a surface- faulting earthquake, design ground
motion parameters for seismic slope stability analyses shall be based on the
peak accelerations with a 3.5 percent probability in 50 years (1,400-year
recurrence interval). Peak bedrock ground motions can be readily obtained via
the internet from the United States geological survey (USGS) national seismic
hazard maps, data and documentation web page (USGS, 2002), which is based on
Frankel and others (2002). PGAs obtained from the USGS (2002) web page should
be adjusted for effects of soil/rock (site-class) conditions in accordance with
Seed and others (2001). Site specific response analysis may also be used to
develop PGA values as long as the procedures, input data, and results are
thoroughly documented, and deemed acceptable by the city.
12.2 Pseudo-Static Evaluations.
Pseudo-static methods for evaluating seismic slope stability are acceptable as
long as minimum factors of safety are satisfied, and due consideration is given
in the selection of the seismic coefficient, kh, reduction in material shear
strengths, and the factor of safety for pseudo-static conditions.
Pseudo-static seismic slope stability analyses can be performed using the
"screening analysis" procedure described in Blake et al. (2002). For that
procedure a kh-value is selected from seismic source characteristics (modal
magnitude, modal distance, and firm rock peak ground acceleration) and an
acceptable level of deformation (5 cm) is specified. For that procedure, a
factor of safety of 1.0 or greater is considered acceptable; otherwise, an
analysis of permanent seismic slope deformation shall be performed.
12.3 Permanent Seismic Slope Deformation.
For seismic slope stability analyses, estimates of permanent seismic
displacement are preferred and may be performed using the procedures outlined
in Blake and others (2002). It should be noted that Bray and Rathje (1998),
referenced in Blake and others (2002), has been updated and superseded by Bray
and Travasarou (2007), which is the city's currently preferred method. For
those analyses, calculated seismic displacements shall be 5 cm or less, or
mitigation measures shall be proposed to limit calculated displacements to 5 cm
or less.
For specific projects, different levels of tolerable displacement may be
possible, but site-specific conditions, which shall include the following, must
be considered:
      (a) The extent to which the displacements are localized or broadly
distributed - broadly distributed shear deformations would generally be less
damaging and more displacement could be allowed.
      (b) The displacement tolerance of the foundation system - stiff, well-
reinforced foundations with lateral continuity of vertical support elements
would be more resistant to damage (and hence could potentially tolerate larger
displacements) than typical slabs-on-grade or foundation systems with
individual spread footings.
      (c) The potential of the foundation soils to experience strain softening
- slopes composed of soils likely to experience strain softening should be
designed for relatively low displacements if peak strengths are used in the
evaluation of ky due to the potential for progressive failure, which could
involve very large displacements following strain softening.
In order to consider a threshold larger than 5 cm, the project consultant shall
provide prior, acceptable justification to the city and obtain the city's
approval. Such justification shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
city, that the proposed project will achieve acceptable performance.
13.0 Water Retention Basins And Flood Control Channels.
For cut, fill, or natural slopes containing or proposed to contain water-
retention basins or flood-control channels, slope stability analyses shall be
performed. In addition to analyzing typical static and seismic slope stability,
those analyses shall consider the effects of rapid drawdown, if such a
condition could develop.
14.0 Mitigation.
When slope stability hazards are determined to exist on a project, measures to
mitigate impacts from those hazards shall be implemented. Some guidance
regarding mitigation measures is provided in Blake et al. (2002). Slope
stability mitigation methods include 1) hazard avoidance, 2) grading to improve
slope stability, 3) reinforcement of the slope or improvement of the soil
within the slope, and 4) reinforcement of the structure built on the slope to
tolerate anticipated slope displacements.
Where mitigation measures that are intended to add stabilizing forces to the
slope are to be implemented, consideration may need to be given to strain
compatibility. For example, if a compacted fill buttress is proposed to
stabilize laterally unsupported bedding or a landslide, the amount of
deformation needed to mobilize the recommended shear strength in the buttress
shall be considered to confirm that it will not result in adverse movements of
the upslope bedding or landslide deposits. Similarly, if a series of drilled
soldier piers is to be used to support a potentially unstable slope and a
residential structure will be built on the piers, pier deformations resulting
from movements needed to mobilize the soil's shear strength shall be compared
to tolerable deflections in the supported structure.
14.1 Full Mitigation.
Full mitigation of slope stability hazards shall be performed for developments
in the city, except as defined in section 14.2. Remedial measures that produce
static factors of safety in excess of 1.5 and acceptable seismic displacement
estimates shall be implemented as needed.
14.2 Partial Mitigation For Seismic Displacement Hazards.
On some projects or portions thereof (such as small structural additions,
residential "infill projects", non-habitable structures, and non-structural
natural-slope areas), full mitigation of seismic slope displacements may not be
possible, due to physical or economic constraints. In those cases, partial
mitigation, to the extent that it prevents structural collapse, injury, and
loss of life, may be possible if it can be provided consistent with IBC
philosophies, and if it is approved by the city of North Salt Lake. The
applicability of partial mitigations to specific projects will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis.
15.0 Notice Of Geologic Hazard And Waiver Of Liability.
For developments where full mitigation of seismic slope displacements is not
implemented, a notice of geologic hazard shall be recorded with the proposed
development describing the displacement hazard at issue and the partial
mitigation employed. The notice shall clearly state that the seismic
displacement hazard at the site has been reduced by the partial mitigation, but
not totally eliminated.
In addition, the owner shall assume all risks, waive all claims against the
city and its consultants, and indemnify and hold the city and its consultants
harmless from any and all claims arising from the partial mitigation of the
seismic displacement hazard.

10-12-33-3: APPENDIX C, MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR LIQUEFACTION INVESTIGATIONS AND
EVALUATIONS:
1.0 Introduction.
The procedures and standards outlined herein are intended to provide
consultants with a general outline for performing liquefaction investigations
and to specify the expectations of the city of North Salt Lake. The standards
constitute the minimum level of effort required in conducting liquefaction
investigations in the city. Considering the complexity inherent in performing
liquefaction investigations, additional effort beyond the minimum standards
presented herein may be required at some sites to adequately address
liquefaction potential at the site. The information presented herein does not
relieve consultants of their duty to perform additional geologic or
geotechnical engineering analyses they believe are necessary to adequately
assess the liquefaction potential at a site.
The purpose of establishing minimum standards for liquefaction investigations
is to:
(a) Protect the health, safety, welfare, and property of the public by
minimizing the potentially adverse effects of liquefaction and related hazards;
(b) Assist property owners and land developers in conducting reasonable and
adequate studies;
(c) Provide consulting geologists and geotechnical engineers with a common
basis for preparing proposals, conducting investigations, and mitigation; and,
(d) Provide an objective framework for regulatory review of liquefaction
investigation reports.
1.1 Properties Requiring Liquefaction Analyses.

Figure 1.1 depicts generalized liquefaction susceptibility for the city, and
shall be used to determine whether or not a site-specific liquefaction
assessment is required for a particular project.
The liquefaction-potential map is based on a regional-scale investigation of
Davis County. These maps may not identify all areas that have potential for
liquefaction; a site located outside of a zone of required investigation is not
necessarily free from liquefaction hazard. The zone does not always include
lateral spread run-out areas. The liquefaction- potential map for Davis County,
UT complete technical report is available from the Davis County community
development department.
Title 10, chapter 12 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code, sensitive
area district & geologic hazards ordinance requires a site-specific
liquefaction investigation to be performed prior to approval of a project based
on the land- use/liquefaction potential matrix shown in the following table.

1.2 Roles Of Engineering Geology And Geotechnical Engineering.
The investigation of liquefaction hazard is an interdisciplinary practice. The
site investigation report must be prepared by a qualified geologist or
geotechnical engineer, who must have competence in the field of seismic hazard
evaluation and mitigation, and be reviewed by a qualified geologist and
geotechnical engineer, also competent in the field of seismic hazard evaluation
and mitigation.
Because of the differing expertise and abilities of qualified geologists and
geotechnical engineers, the scope of the site investigation report for the
project may require that both types of professionals prepare and review the
report, each practicing in the area of their expertise. Involvement of both a
qualified geologist and geotechnical engineer will generally provide greater
assurance that the hazard is properly identified, assessed, and mitigated.
Liquefaction analyses are the responsibility of the geotechnical engineer,
although the geologist should be involved in the application of screening
criteria (section 3.0, steps 1 and 2) and general geologic site evaluation
(section 4.1) to map the likely extent of liquefiable deposits and shallow
groundwater. Engineering properties of earth material shall be evaluated by the
geotechnical engineer. The performance of the quantitative liquefaction
analysis resulting in a numerical factor of safety and quantitative assessment
of settlement and liquefaction-induced permanent ground displacement shall be
performed by geotechnical engineers.
The geotechnical and civil engineers shall develop all mitigation and design
recommendations. Ground motion parameters for use in quantitative liquefaction
analyses may be provided by either the geologist or geotechnical engineer.
1.3 Minimum Qualifications Of The Licensed Professional.
Liquefaction analyses must be performed by qualified geologists and qualified
geotechnical engineers (see sections
10-12-5 and
10-12-6 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code).
2.0 General Requirements.
Except for the derivation of input ground motion (see section 5.0),
liquefaction investigations should be performed in general accordance with the
latest version of Recommended Procedures For Implementation Of DMG Special
Publication 117, Guidelines For Analyzing And Mitigating Liquefaction In
California (Martin and Lew, 1999). Additional protocol for liquefaction
investigations is provided in Youd and Idriss (1997). In addition to these
standards, all liquefaction analyses, reports and recommendations shall follow
the latest adopted guidelines published by the Utah geological survey. See
title 10, chapter 12 of the city of North Salt Lake municipal code, sensitive
area district & geologic hazards ordinance for supplemental requirements.
Acceptable factors of safety are shown on the table in section 1.2.
3.0 Preliminary Screening For Liquefaction.
The liquefaction study area map is based on broad regional studies and does not
replace site-specific studies. The fact that a site is located within a
liquefaction study area does not mean that there is a significant liquefaction
potential at the site, only that a study shall be performed to determine if
there is.
Soil liquefaction is caused by strong seismic ground shaking where saturated,
cohesionless, granular soil undergoes a significant loss in shear strength that
can result in settlement and permanent ground displacement. Surface effects of
liquefaction include: settlement, bearing capacity failure, ground
oscillations, lateral spread and flow failure. It has been well documented that
soil liquefaction may occur in clean sands, silty sands, and sandy silt, non-
plastic silts and gravelly soils. The following conditions must be present for
liquefaction to occur:
      (a) Soils must be submerged below the water table;
      (b) Soils must be loose to moderately dense;
      (c) Ground shaking must be relatively intense; and
      (d) The duration of ground shaking must be sufficient for the soils to
generate seismically-induced excess pore water pressure and lose their shearing
resistance.
The following screening criteria may be applied to determine if further
quantitative evaluation of liquefaction hazard is required:
      (a) If the estimated maximum past-, current-, and maximum- future-
groundwater-levels (i.e., the highest groundwater level applicable for
liquefaction analyses) are determined to be deeper than 50 feet below the
existing ground surface or proposed finished grade (whichever is deeper),
liquefaction assessments are not required. For soil materials that are located
above the level of the groundwater, a quantitative assessment of seismically
induced settlement is required.
      (b) If "bedrock" or similar lithified formational material underlies the
site, those materials need not be considered liquefiable and no analysis of
their liquefaction potential is necessary.
      (c) If the corrected standard penetration blow count, (N1)60, is greater
than or equal to 33 in all samples with a sufficient number of tests,
liquefaction assessments are not required. If cone penetration test soundings
are made, the corrected cone penetration test tip resistance, qc1N, should be
greater than or equal to 180 in all soundings in sand materials, otherwise
liquefaction assessments are needed. All SPT measurements shall be made with
calibrated hammers, where the hammer efficiency is known, and values can be
adjusted to (N1)60 for calculations, as needed.
If plastic soil (PI . 20) materials are encountered during site exploration,
those materials may be considered non- liquefiable. Additional acceptable
screening criteria regarding the effects of plasticity on liquefaction
susceptibility are presented in Boulanger and Idriss (2004), Bray and Sancio
(2006), and Seed and others (2003).
If the screening investigation clearly demonstrates the absence of liquefaction
hazards at a project site and the city concurs, the screening investigation
will satisfy the site investigation report requirement for liquefaction
hazards. If not, a quantitative evaluation is required to assess the
liquefaction hazards.
4.0 Field Investigations.
Geotechnical field investigations are routinely performed for new projects as
part of the normal development and design process. Geologic reconnaissance and
subsurface explorations are normally performed as part of the field exploration
program even when liquefaction does not need to be investigated.
4.1 Geologic Reconnaissance.
Geologic research and reconnaissance are important to provide information to
define the extent of unconsolidated deposits that may be prone to liquefaction.
Such information should be presented on geologic maps and cross sections and
provide a description of the formations present at the site that includes the
nature, thickness, and origin of Quaternary deposits with liquefaction
potential. There also should be an analysis of groundwater conditions at the
site that includes the highest recorded water level and the highest water level
likely to occur under the most adverse foreseeable conditions in the future.
Shallow groundwater may exist for a variety of reasons, some of which are of
natural and or manmade origin. Landscape irrigation, on-site sewage disposal,
and unlined manmade lakes reservoirs, and storm-water detention basins may
create a shallow groundwater table in sediments that were previously
unsaturated.
During the field investigation, the geologist should map the limits of
unconsolidated deposits with liquefaction potential. Liquefaction typically
occurs in cohesionless silt, sand, and fine-grained gravel deposits of Holocene
to late Pleistocene age in areas where groundwater is shallower than about 50
feet.
4.2 Subsurface Explorations.
Subsurface explorations shall consist of drilled-borings and/or cone
penetration tests (CPTs). The exploration program shall be planned to determine
the soil stratigraphy, groundwater level, and indices that could be used to
evaluate the potential for liquefaction by either in situ testing or by
laboratory testing of soil samples. Borings and CPT soundings must penetrate a
minimum of 50 feet below final ground surface. If a standard penetration test
(SPT) is used, sampling intervals shall not exceed 2.5 feet.
For saturated cohesionless soils where the SPT (N1)60 values are less than 15,
or where CPT tip resistances are below 60 tsf, grain-size analyses, hydrometer
tests, and Atterberg Limits tests shall be performed on these soils to further
evaluate their potential for permanent ground displacement (Youd et al., 2002)
and other forms of liquefaction-induced ground failure and settlement.
Where a structure may have subterranean construction or deep foundations (e.g.,
caissons or piles), the depth of investigation should extend to a depth that is
a minimum of 20 feet (6 m) below the lowest expected foundation level (e.g.,
caisson bottom or pile tip) or 50 feet (15 m) below the existing ground surface
or lowest proposed finished grade, whichever is deeper. If, during the
investigation, the indices to evaluate liquefaction indicate that the
liquefaction potential may extend below that depth, the exploration should be
continued until a significant thickness (at least 10 feet or 3 m, to the extent
possible) of nonliquefiable soils are encountered.
5.0 Ground Motion For Liquefaction Susceptibility And Ground Deformation
Analyses.
In regards to design ground accelerations for liquefaction analyses, the city
of North Salt Lake prefers a probabilistic approach to determining the
likelihood that different levels of ground motion will be exceeded at a
particular site within a given time period. In order to more closely represent
the seismic characteristics of the WFZ and better capture this possible high
likelihood of a surface-faulting earthquake on the Salt Lake City segment,
design ground motion parameters for liquefaction analyses shall be based on the
peak accelerations with a 3.5 percent probability in 50 years (1,400-year
recurrence interval). Peak bedrock ground motions can be readily obtained via
the internet from the United States geological survey (USGS) national seismic
hazard maps, data and documentation web page (USGS, 2002), which is based on
Frankel and others (2002). PGAs obtained from the USGS (2002) web page should
be adjusted for effects of soil/rock (site-class) conditions in accordance with
Seed and others (2001) or other appropriate methods that consider the site-
specific soil conditions and their potential for amplification/deamplification
of the high frequency strong motion.
6.0 Remedial Design.
Sites, facilities, buildings, structures and utilities that are founded on or
traverse liquefiable soils may require further remedial design and/or
relocation to avoid liquefaction-induced damage. These should be investigated
and evaluated on a site-specific basis with sufficient geologic and
geotechnical evaluations to support the remedial design or mitigative plan.
This design or plan may include: changes/modifications to the soil, foundation
system, structural frame or support of the building, etc. and shall be reviewed
and approved by the city.
7.0 Submittals.
Submittals for review shall include: boring logs; geologic cross-sections;
laboratory data; discussions pertaining to how idealized subsurface conditions
and parameters used for analyses were developed; analytical results, including
computer output files (on request); and summaries of the liquefaction analyses
and conclusions regarding liquefaction potential and likely types and amounts
of ground failure.
Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic
cross-sections and must be utilized by the geotechnical engineer for the
liquefaction analyses. If on-site sewage or storm-water disposal exists or is
proposed, the liquefaction analyses shall include the effects of the effluent
plume on liquefaction potential.
The results of any liquefaction analyses must be submitted with pertinent
backup documentation (i.e., calculations, computer output, etc.). Printouts of
input data, output data (on request), and graphical plots must be submitted for
each computer-aided liquefaction analysis. In addition, data files, recorded on
diskettes, CDs, or other electronic media, may be requested to facilitate the
city's review.

Council may accept or modify the proposed general development plan, subject to
final review and approval of the rezone request and development agreement.
   F.   Phased development plans shall include subdivision plans and/or planned
unit development plans which shall become part of the general development plan.
(Ord. 2018-11, 10-2-2018)
10-13-4: STEP 2 - FINAL REZONE APPROVAL:
   A.   Upon approval of the General Development Plan by the City Council, the
applicant shall submit application for concurrent review either a preliminary
subdivision plan or a final site plan application, as applicable. Applications
shall address any issues or concerns raised by the City Council at General
Development Plan approval along with any conditions of said approval.
   B.   Upon receipt of complete preliminary subdivision plan or site plan
application, the application shall be reviewed by the Development Review
Committee (DRC). The DRC shall provide written comments to the applicant within
fourteen (14) days of receipt. The applicant may request a meeting with the DRC
or staff to discuss the comments. Upon receipt of a written response to the
comments and any revised submittal, the DRC shall review the resubmittal and
make a recommendation on the application to the Planning Commission.
   C.   Once a recommendation has been made by the DRC, the Community
Development Department shall schedule a public meeting before the Planning
Commission for review of the application and final recommendation on the final
P-District rezone request, including the proposed P-District land use
regulations to be contained within the development agreement.
   D.   The Community Development Department shall provide to the Planning
Commission copies of all pertinent documents, plans, and maps related to the
project, along with the proposed P-District land use regulations to be
contained within the final development agreement and rezone ordinance.
   E.   At the public meeting the Planning Commission may recommend to the City
Council the approval of a P-District rezone request and proposed P-District
land use regulations to be contained within the final development agreement and
rezone ordinance.
   F.   In a separate motion the Planning Commission may recommend to the City
Council approval of the proposed preliminary subdivision plan or site plan, as
applicable, or may table action on the proposed preliminary subdivision plan or
site plan, pending final action on the rezone request by the City Council.
   G.   Upon receipt of the recommended P-District rezone request and P-
District land use regulations, the City Council may by ordinance establish a P
District; provided, that it finds that the facts submitted with the application
(s) and presented at the public meetings establish that:
      1.   The proposed P District, or the primary phase(s) thereof, can be
substantially completed within two (2) years of the establishment of the P
District.
      2.   The primary phase of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; and that the uses
proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but
will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under other zoning
districts.
      3.   The streets proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated
traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as
to overload the street network outside the P District.
      4.   Commercial development can be justified economically at the
locations proposed, if any, to provide commercial facilities.
      5.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
      6.   Any exception from standard ordinance requirements is warranted by
the design and amenities incorporated into the final plan.
      7.   The P District is in conformance with the City general land use
plan.
      8.   Existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the
population and use densities proposed. (Ord. 2018-11, 10-2-2018)
10-13-5: DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND AGREEMENT TO CONSTITUTE PLANNED DISTRICT
REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   At the time of adoption of any ordinance establishing a P District, the
City and the developer shall enter into a development agreement to define the
development, its uses, street pattern, public and private improvements, open
spaces, public dedications and grants of easements, and any other specifics
about the project deemed necessary for the overall project. The development
agreement shall include a list of all permitted and conditional uses in the
project and building standards, to include setbacks, building height, lot
coverage, and other regulations related to the siting of buildings.
   B.   The development agreement shall include the general development plan
which shall guide all development within the specific project being approved.
The general development plan shall consist of a site plan and landscape plan
containing the following: survey and legal description, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, proposed building placement, setbacks, streetscape,
parking, fire protection, fencing, signage locations, open space/parks,
streetscape and building setback diagrams, along with conceptual building
elevations and design schemes, plus any other information required for
preliminary site plan approval. If, in the course of developing the project,
changes are to be made to the general development plan which are substantially
different from the general development plan, a new general development plan
shall be considered for recommendation by the Planning Commission and adopted
by the City Council and a new public hearing held. "Substantially different"
means any increase in the gross residential density, an increase or decrease in
use greater than ten percent (10%) of the total project floor area, a twenty
percent (20%) or greater change in the gross floor area of a project or a
change in specific use, commercial or residential. Realignment of streets or
utility improvements when no change in overall use occurs shall not be
considered "substantially different".
   C.   The approved general development plan shall be considered an integral
part of the land use regulations for the area being approved and developed.
Substantial variation between the general development plan and any phased
development plans shall require review and recommendation from the Planning
Commission and approval from the City Council, and a new public hearing.
"Substantial variation" means any increase in gross residential density, and
increase or decrease in use greater than ten percent (10%) of the total project
floor area, or any addition, modification or alteration to a building or site
plan that exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the gross floor area. Modifications
to street alignments, when the uses contained on those streets do not change,
shall not constitute a "substantial variation" under this subsection. All
modifications must meet the minimum standards set forth in the development
agreement and by this title.
   D.   Upon approval of the development agreement, which shall include the
general development plan, and the zoning map amendment, all approved uses shall
be processed based on the standards approved in the development agreement.
(Ord. 2018-11, 10-2-2018)
10-13-6: CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PLANNED DISTRICT MAY REVERT TO ORIGINAL ZONING:
   A.   If no development has occurred to effectuate a P District development
within two (2) years after the district is created, the City Council may direct
the Planning Commission to schedule a public hearing to determine whether or
not it is in the public interest to rezone the P-District to the previous zone
or another appropriate zone. If the Planning Commission so recommends, the City
Council may repeal the original P-District ordinance or adopt a new ordinance
rezoning the property to an appropriate zone.
   B.   If the land within a P District is sold to a new owner, the City
Council shall require the new owner to accept in writing all obligations and
guarantees required by the development agreement of the original owner. In the
event that such written agreement is not provided, the City Council may direct
the Planning Commission to schedule a public hearing to determine whether or
not it is in the public interest to rezone the P-District to the previous zone
or another appropriate zone. If the Planning Commission so recommends, the City
Council may repeal the original P-District ordinance or adopt a new ordinance.
   C.   If the owner or developer of the P District is unwilling or unable to
carry out the requirements of the development agreement because claimed
adequate water supplies, wastewater disposal, streets or other major elements
of approval cannot or will not be provided as required, the City Council may
stop all development in the district until such failure has been remedied or
may initiate a rezoning of the property to the original zoning which existed
prior to creation of the P District, in the manner described above, without
waiting for the two (2) year period provided above. (Ord. 2018-11, 10-2-2018)

All uses located within the limits of the redevelopment overlay zone are
conditional uses and require issuance of a conditional use permit. (Ord. 93-5,
7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-14-4: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Uses may be continued or changed.
   B.   Buildings may be altered to accommodate new uses.
   C.   Uses and buildings may be limited as to scope or length of time.
   D.   Every conditional use permit and each approval shall be based primarily
on how the development, as proposed in the application, will contribute to
economic activity, compatibility, mutual private and public benefit from
existing, proposed or potential buildings and uses in the area; the efficient,
effective, economic and aesthetic use of land, buildings, landscaping and
amenities; and the improvements to be made in land utilization, building
construction and appearance, traffic safety and control, landscaping and
drainage.
   E.   Conditional use permit approval process requires timely notification of
the municipal redevelopment agency to allow for analysis and input to the
process. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)

10-15-1: PURPOSE:
It is hereby determined that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property
of users of airports and property or occupants of land in its vicinity and,
also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area
available for landing, take off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to
destroy or impair the utility of airports and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is hereby declared that:
   A.   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance
and an injury to the region served by airports;
   B.   It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be
prevented; and
   C.   The prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent
legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation.
(Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)

permitted by local zoning ordinances.
AIRPORT ELEVATION: The highest point of the airport's usable landing area
measured in feet from mean sea level.
AIRPORT HAZARD: Any structure or object or natural growth located on or in the
vicinity of the airport, or any use of land near the airport, which obstructs
the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or take off at the
airport, or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or take off of aircraft.
AIRPORT REFERENCE POINT: The point established as the approximate geographic
center of the airport landing area and so designated.
FAA: The federal aviation administration.
HEIGHT: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth
in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall mean sea level
elevation unless otherwise specified.
NONCONFORMING USE: Any preexisting structure, tree or use of land which is
inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or an amendment thereto.
NONPRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY: A runway having an existing instrument approach

10-15-3: AIRPORT ZONES:
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established certain overlay zones which may include all of the land lying
within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones and conical
zones. Such zones shall be effective only to the extent shown on the airport
zoning map on file in the office of the planning commission as the same appears
as of the effective date hereof, and as amended from time to time hereafter to
reflect the changes made thereon by ordinances adopted by the city council, and
said map by ordinances adopted by the city council and said map and all
references, notations and other information shown therein are hereby made a
part of this chapter to the same extent as if said map and the information
thereon where fully described and set forth herein. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff.
7-15-1993)
10-15-4: UTILITY RUNWAY VISUAL APPROACH ZONES:
Utility runway visual approach zones are hereby established with the inner edge
coinciding with the width of the primary surface and being two hundred fifty
feet (250') wide. The approach zone expands outward, uniformly, to a width of
one thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface, its centerline being the
continuation of the centerline of the runway. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-
1993)
10-15-5: RUNWAY LARGER THAN UTILITY WITH VISIBILITY MINIMUM AS LOW AS THREE-
FOURTHS MILE NONPRECISION INSTRUMENT APPROACH ZONES:
Runways larger than utility with a visible minimum as low as three-fourths (3/
4) mile nonprecision instrument approach zones are hereby established with the
inner edge of this approach zone coinciding with the width of the primary zone
and are one thousand feet (1,000') wide. The approach zone expands outward,
uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand feet (16,000') at a horizontal
distance of fifty thousand feet (50,000') from the primary surface, its
centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (Ord. 93-5,
7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-15-6: PRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY APPROACH ZONES:
Precision instrument runway approach zones are hereby established with the
inner edge of this approach zone coinciding with the width of the primary
surface and is one thousand feet (1,000') wide. The approach zone expands
outward, uniformly, to a width of sixteen thousand feet (16,000') at a
horizontal distance of fifty thousand feet (50,000') from the primary surface,
its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (Ord.

to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended, at a slope of
seven feet (7') horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the
primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and
conical surfaces. Transitional zones for these portions of the precision
approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical
surface extend a distance of five thousand feet (5,000') measured horizontally
from the edge of the approach zones and at a ninety degree (90°) angle to the
extended runway centerline. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-15-8: HORIZONTAL ZONES:
   A.   Horizontal zones are hereby established as that area, the perimeter of
which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii, from a point on the
centerline and two hundred feet (200') beyond each end of each runway and
connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
   B.   The radius of each arc is five thousand feet (5,000') for all runways
designated as utility or visual and ten thousand feet (10,000') for all other
runways. The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the
same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either
end of the runway. When a five thousand foot (5,000') arc is encompassed by
tangents connecting two (2) adjacent ten thousand foot (10,000') arcs, the five
thousand foot (5,000') arc shall be disregarded in determining the horizontal
zone. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
(Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-15-9: CONICAL ZONES:

(5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
   D.   Runway Larger Than Utility With Visibility Minimum As Low As Three-
Fourths Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach: The height limitation in a
runway larger than utility with a visual minimum as low as three-fourths (3/4)
mile nonprecision instrument zone slopes upward one hundred feet (100')
horizontally, for each foot vertically, beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extends to a horizontal distance of ten
thousand feet (10,000') along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes
upward forty feet (40') horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional
horizontal distance of forty thousand feet (40,000') along the extended runway
centerline.
   E.   Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zones: The height limitation in a
precision runway approach zone slopes upward one hundred feet (100')
horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same

shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or
alterations in any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration which was begun prior to the effective date hereof and is diligently
prosecuted.
   B.   Marking And Lighting: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon
of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport manager
to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport hazards. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
   C.   Abandoned Or Destroyed Nonconforming Uses: Whenever the building
official determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned for a

10-15-14: HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING:
Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances,
be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question
to permit the property owner at his own expense to install, operate and
maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to
fliers the presence of an airport hazard. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-15-15: CONFLICTING REGULATIONS:
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, including land use zoning, whether the conflict be with respect to the

to be as much a part of this chapter by this reference as if fully prescribed
and detailed herein. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
CHAPTER 16
AIRPORT ENVIRONS OVERLAY ZONE (AE)
SECTION:
10-16-1: Purpose
10-16-2: Regulations
10-16-3: Location Of Airport Environs Overlay Zone
10-16-1: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of the airport environs overlay zone to notify and assure
landowners and airport users that the city intends to plan the development
around the airport for safe and appropriate use. Since it is unlikely the
airport will ever be relocated from this area of the city, and is considered to
be a great asset to the city and future economic development, the airport
should be protected and maintained to conserve its value. It is believed that
through negotiations between the various landowners and the planning commission
that proper, safe development will occur. Therefore, all uses located within
the boundaries of this overlay zone are made conditional to assure early
consultation with the planning commission so that developers will be made aware
of the constraints to development around the airport. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993,
eff. 7-15-1993)
10-16-2: REGULATIONS:
All uses permitted or conditional in an underlying zoning district are
conditional uses when included in an airport environs overlay zone, and thus
require conditional use permits. Such uses shall conform to both the general
plan and specific plans adopted for either the airport or its environs by the
planning commission. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993)
10-16-3: LOCATION OF AIRPORT ENVIRONS OVERLAY ZONE:

10-17-6: Sand And Gravel Operations
10-17-7: Appendix SR-17
10-17-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   These areas are unique because of their proximity to prime access, high
visibility and special developmental problems. To define the land use in these
areas within the existing developmental parameters, strict residential zoning
might prove to be too limiting. These areas may change with current economic
and social growth.
   B.   To assure safe and pleasing development within the special use zone,
and to ensure the close interaction of activities, some uses are excluded or
allowed only upon conditional use review as set forth in chapter 7 of this
title. Public safety, traffic circulation, existing uses of the property,
compatibility with surrounding existing and proposed land uses, architectural
character, impact on existing services and tax base, and sensitivity to
neighboring landowner's feelings are critical factors in the review process.
   C.   It is intended that the creation of the special use designation will
increase the control of the Planning Commission and City Council in using the
remaining developable land for the most appropriate use. (Ord. 97-4, 9-16-1997)
10-17-2: PERMITTED USES:

site;
      3.   The applicant has presented a reclamation plan for the site which
identifies the steps to be taken in reclaiming the site in accordance with
subsection B9 of this section, following the termination of mining operations;
and
      4.   Except for the setback requirements listed in subsection B1 of this
section, there shall be no limits as to the area or portion of the site that
may be utilized for mining operations; provided, however, that all disturbed
areas pursuant to a conditional use permit shall be located in the Special Use
Restricted Zone or in areas that are valid nonconforming uses.
   B.   Conditions: Every conditional use permit for a mining operation in the
Special Use Restricted Zone shall contain the following conditions:
      1.   Buffer Distances:
         a.   All extractive operations, roads, machinery, equipment and
stockpiles (excluding topsoil used for reclamation and screening and rock
crushing) shall be kept at least one hundred feet (100') horizontal distance
from any other property owner, except as may be reduced by the Planning
Commission, or in the event that the City Council approves such an exception.
         b.   All rock crushing operations shall be conducted at least four
hundred feet (400') horizontal distance from any other property owner who is
not engaged in mining operations (except as may be reduced by the Planning
Commission), but in no event shall the operation be closer than fifty feet
(50') from such other property owner.
         c.   All excavations shall be kept at least fifty feet (50') from a
public road except where the Planning Commission determines the excavations may
be moved closer if it will not endanger the users of the road.

stabilization shall be done in accordance with the latest reclamation plans and
consistent with industry standards.
      4.   Air And Water Quality: All air and water quality related plans and
actions shall be monitored and approved as required by applicable rules of the
Davis County environmental health division and the state division of air
quality.
      5.   Hours Of Operation: All operation, crushing, screening and hauling
shall be confined to the hours of six o'clock (6:00) A.M. and eleven o'clock
(11:00) P.M., except as approved as a variance or waiver under the noise
ordinances of the city and except that the maintenance and repairs of vehicles
and equipment shall not be restricted by these periods. Operations which are
required as a result of public emergency demands as determined by the planning
commission or the city council shall also be excluded from these restrictions.
(Ord. 97-4, 9-16-1997)
      6.   Noise, Vibration: All equipment on site and off site utilized in the
extraction and processing of native natural resources shall be operated and
maintained so as to minimize the emanation of noise and vibration beyond the
property boundary. Soil berming and other techniques should be used to
accomplish the objective of reducing the impact of noise and vibration on
adjacent property.
      7.   Roads: All permanent haul roads within one hundred feet (100') of
public streets shall be regularly surfaced with asphalt or oil, and all
roadways shall be regularly watered, swept or surfaced so as to minimize loose
gravel, sand and soils from being carried onto the public streets. (Ord. 97-4,
9-16-1997; amd. 2012 Code)
      8.   Identification: Monuments or other means of identification shall be
placed and maintained around the perimeter of the excavation site so as to
enable reasonable identification of the property line separating the excavation
property from adjoining landowners.
      9.   Reclamation:
         a.   Objectives: The objectives of excavation reclamation shall be:
            (1)   To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or
within a reasonable amount of time thereafter, to a predetermined condition
defined by the reclamation plan as submitted and approved, compatible with
planned, past, present or probable future land uses.
            (2)   To minimize or prevent present and future on site or off site
environmental degradations to the ecologic and hydrologic regimes caused by
mining operations, and to meet other pertinent state and federal regulations
regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria.
            (3)   To minimize or prevent present and future hazards to public
safety and welfare.
         b.   Rehabilitation Standards: Following the termination of mining
operations, the site shall be reclaimed in accordance with the following
standards:
            (1)   The side walls of any pit or mound located on the site shall
be smoothed and evenly contoured, and the floor of the pit or top of a mound
shall be flattened and leveled;
            (2)   Mounds of fill shall not remain after reclamation of an
extraction operation;
            (3)   No slope shall be steeper than the critical angle of repose
for the material as required by applicable MHSA/OSHA standards (e.g., 33
degrees for gravel deposits);
            (4)   All areas shall be covered with a one inch (1") or thicker
layer of topsoil and reseeded with a hardy plant material having a sufficient
concentration to screen at least twenty five percent (25%) of the exposed
surface from view. Exceptions: Areas which naturally lack or have minimal soil
or vegetation shall be restored to a surface that corresponds with the native
condition of such an area rather than adding soil and/or reseeding.
   C.   Provision Of Surety:
      1.   Provision Of Surety Before Operations Begin: After receiving
notification that the conditional use permit has been approved by the planning
commission, but prior to the commencement of operation, the operator shall
provide reclamation surety to the city, in the form and amount to be reasonably
determined by the planning commission in consultation with the city engineer
and city council. (Ord. 97-4, 9-16-1997)
      2.   Amount Of Surety: In determining the amount of surety to be
provided, the planning commission shall consider factual information as to the
magnitude, type and costs of approved reclamation activities planned for the
land affected and the nature, extent and duration of operations under the
approved notice. The planning commission shall fix the amount of the bond
reasonably related thereto, to protect the city and ensure compliance with the
reclamation requirements of the conditional use permit; however, the amount of
the bond shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost of
rehabilitating the excavation. The bond shall be periodically reviewed to
ensure that the amount of the bond is capable of providing for the required
reclamation. (Ord. 97-4, 9-16-1997; amd. 2012 Code)
      3.   Form Of Surety: In determining the form of surety to be provided by
the operator, the planning commission may approve a method acceptable and
consistent with the requirements of this chapter which may be one or a
combination of corporate surety bond, land, cash or other deposited securities.
Such surety may also be in the form of a corporate undertaking by the operator
or any other entity that has assets or net worth reasonably adequate to ensure
the reclamation of the site as required by the conditional use permit.
      4.   Release Of Surety: The liability under surety provisions shall
continue until such time as released as to part, or in its entirety, by the
city council.
      5.   Forfeiture Of Surety: If the operator fails or refuses to carry out
the necessary land reclamation as outlined in the approved reclamation plan,
the planning commission may, after notice and hearing, declare any surety filed
for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate bond, file suit against
the operator and its bonding company. The city shall also have the right to
file suit against the defaulting permittee for costs of required reclamation
and reasonable attorney fees.
   D.   Inspections: An annual on site investigation and report will be
conducted by the public works department to determine whether the terms of the
grading plan and reclamation plan are being met; provided, however, that the
reasonable modifications of the site plan may be made by the applicant or
operator of the mining operations in so far as such modifications are required
in connection with the development of the site and the subsurface conditions
discovered pursuant to the mining operations.
   E.   Not A Nuisance: The mining operations shall not constitute a nuisance
pursuant to any ordinance of the city; provided, that parties locating
residences within the vicinity of the mining operations subsequent to approval
of the conditional use permit shall be deemed to have "come to the nuisance".

      9.   Low impact development (LID):
         a.   Low impact development (LID) is an approach to land development
that uses various land planning and design practices and technologies to
simultaneously conserve and protect natural resource systems and reduce
infrastructure costs. LID still allows land to be developed, but in a cost
effective manner that helps mitigate potential environmental impacts.
         b.   As part of the city of North Salt Lake permit, the city requires
use of an LID approach, which includes the implementation of structural BMPs,
where practicable, that infiltrate, evapotranspire or harvest and use
stormwater for the site to protect water quality.
         c.   All development and redevelopment that warrants compliance with
the UGCP regulation must include an LID analysis that meets the objective of
mirroring the predevelopment hydrology and meets the objective of retaining on
site, with no discharge, the 0.6-inch, 24-hour rainfall event.
         d.   Redevelopment of commercial, industrial, institutional, or multi-
family sites that add or replace (alone or in combinations) five thousand
(5,000) square feet of impervious surface or disturb five thousand (5,000)
square feet of land must include an LID analysis that meets the objective of
retaining on site, with no discharge, the 0.6-inch, 24-hour rainfall event.
Groundwater recharge may be considered to meet this requirement, where
applicable and feasible.
         e.   No LID limits are defined except designs must not negatively
impact surrounding properties. The analysis must identify LID options
considered and list the reasons why it will be incorporated or why the
considered LIDs are not practical for the site use or conditions. Submit a
report with stormwater calculations that summarizes the analysis and results.
         f.   Suggested and preferred LIDs are outlined in the city's
"Stormwater Best Management Practices Handbook". The city engineer may consider
and approve other innovative LID approaches not included as preferred measures
that meet or exceed the objectives of the city's stormwater management plan.
      10.   Postconstruction stormwater maintenance plan and agreement:
         a.   The purpose of the postconstruction stormwater maintenance plan
and agreement is to control stormwater runoff and reduce pollutants in
stormwater runoff after construction is complete and the developed site is in
operation. This is achieved by accomplishing the following:
            (1)   Controlling erosion.
            (2)   Controlling discharge of sediment into stormwater drainage
facilities or off site.
            (3)   Preventing illicit discharges into on site soils, storm
drainage facilities or off site.
            (4)   Prevention of debris and garbage from entering the stormwater
system.
         b.   A postconstruction stormwater maintenance plan must be prepared
and submitted with the plans for approval for all privately owned or maintained
facilities that warrant compliance with the UGCP regulation. The plan shall be
contained on a plan sheet of its own, rather than being a part of another plan
sheet, and is to contain at least the following:
            (1)   The site plan, including vicinity map, proposed contours,
permanent stormwater features, and landscaping.
            (2)   BMPs to accomplish the purpose of the plan. Examples of
appropriate BMPs may include those addressing operation and maintenance of
storm drainage quality control facilities, operation and maintenance of
stormwater discharge control facilities, maintenance of landscaping, good
housekeeping practices, etc.
            (3)   Showing the following for each BMP specified:
               (A)   Location and extent of specified BMPs, as appropriate.
               (B)   Detailed schedule of execution for each specified BMP, in
terms of starting time, duration, frequency, etc., as appropriate.
               (C)   Any information in addition to or different from that
shown on the BMP fact sheets as necessary to employ the BMPs on the site.
         c.   The owner of development that warrants compliance with the UGCP
regulation must submit a signed stormwater maintenance agreement using the city
of North Salt Lake agreement template. The postconstruction maintenance
agreement needs to be recorded at the Davis County recorder's office.

10-22-3: LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Plant Selection:
      1.   Plants shall be well-suited to the microclimate and soil conditions
at the project site. Both native and locally-adapted plants are acceptable.
Plants with similar water needs shall be grouped together as much as possible.
      2.   Areas with slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%) shall be
landscaped with deep-rooting, water-conserving plants for erosion control and
soil stabilization and are not permitted to be planted with turf grass.
      3.   Park strips and other landscaped areas less than eight feet (8')
wide may not be landscaped with sod/turf. Only water-conserving plants, which
do not have a mass planting of any type of plant material which requires
uniform overhead spray irrigation, may be used in a park strip
      4.   Shrubs and ornamental grasses shall be planted and maintained in
groupings of at least three (3) to increase the microclimate shade area above
plant root zones, and to provide a pleasing and balanced aesthetic of plant
material massing in the landscape. Groupings may consist of straight rows,
grids or triangulation planting patterns.
      5.   Plants and trees specified for a project landscape plan shall be
selected from the WBWCD recommended plant list and the recommended trees
included in Title 7, Chapter 9, Community Forestry. These plant materials are
suitable for the local climate with respect to temperature ranges and moderate
to high drought tolerance. Additional plant species that can be demonstrated as
suitable for the local climate and soil conditions, shall be permitted.
      6.   The typical plant bed width shall be a minimum of three feet (3');
the minimum plant bed width shall be one and a half feet (1.5') for ornamental

climbing vines.
      7.   Plant beds may be substituted by planters or other similar
streetscape amenities within the Core Subdistrict of the Town Center.
   B.   Tree Selection: Tree species shall be selected based on growth
characteristics and site conditions, including available space, overhead
clearance, soil conditions, exposure, and desired color and appearance. Trees
shall be selected as follows:
      1.   Broad canopy trees shall be selected where shade or screening of
tall objects is desired;
      2.   Low-growing trees shall be selected for spaces under utility wires;
      3.   Select trees from which lower branches can be trimmed to maintain a
healthy growth habit where vision clearance and natural surveillance is a
concern;
      4.   Narrow or columnar trees shall be selected where awnings or other
building features limit growth, or where greater visibility is desired between
buildings and the street for natural surveillance;
      5.   Street trees shall be planted in accordance with Title 7, Chapter 9,
Community Forestry for placement within existing and proposed park strips, and
in sidewalk tree wells on streets without park strips. Tree placement shall
provide canopy cover (shade) and avoid conflicts with existing trees, retaining
walls, utilities, lighting, and other obstacles; and
      6.   All new trees planted shall be irrigated by means of drip irrigation
rings and not by overhead sprinklers.
   C.   Mulch: After completion of all planting, all irrigated non-turf areas
shall be covered with a minimum three inch (3") layer of mulch to retain water,
inhibit weed growth, and moderate soil temperature. Non-porous material shall
not be placed under the mulch. Permitted mulch:
      1.   All rock mulch must be angular or crushed, clean or washed landscape
gravel, and be rocks size of two-inch minus;
      2.   Pea gravel is prohibited for use in park strips;

level or slightly below the height of the sidewalk and curb to prevent erosion
loss.
   D.   Soil Preparation: Soil preparation will be suitable to provide healthy
growing conditions for the plants and to encourage water infiltration and
penetration. Soil preparation shall include scarifying the soil to a minimum
depth of six (6) inches and amending the soil with organic material as per
specific recommendations of the Landscape Designer/Landscape Architect based on
the soil conditions.
      1.   Soil amendments (organic material) shall also be added and tilled
into the soil to a minimum depth of six inches (6") to increase organic content
and improve water retention.
      2.   Soil amendment type and quantity shall be recommended by the
Landscape Architect (designer) based on a review of the soil conditions.
   E.   Turf Design:
      1.   Turf species are required to be drought tolerant.
      2.   Turf grass shall not be installed in areas less than eight feet (8')
wide.
      3.   Turf grass shall not be allowed in park strips, parking lot islands,
and other planted bed landscape areas.
      4.   Turf grass shall not be allowed on slopes with a grade over twenty
five percent (25%).
      5.   A minimum of one tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of turf
area shall be planted within or adjacent to the turf area.
   F.   Park Strip Design: The intent of this section is to provide an
assortment of allowed plant, organic and/or natural materials that allow for
creative landscaping, maintain a healthy street tree canopy, and create an
attractive pedestrian environment while encouraging water conservation.
      1.   Plant Coverage: Live plant materials, not to exceed twenty two
inches (22") in height, are allowed. Plants with heights up to thirty six
inches (36") tall may be allowed as specimen or accent plants when not located
within clear view areas (see section
10-1-31). These plants may not be planted in a manner that would create a
visual barrier between the street and the sidewalk.
      2.   At least thirty three percent (33%) or more of the park strip
surface must be covered with perennial or low growing shrub vegetation within
three (3) years of planting or when planting has reached maturity, whichever
comes first.
         a.   The addition of street trees chosen in accordance with Title 7,
Chapter 9, Community Forestry shall be credited towards required park strip
plant coverage as follows:
            (1)   Small Trees: Fifty (50) square feet;
            (2)   Medium Trees: Seventy five (75) square feet;
            (3)   Large Trees: One hundred (100) square feet;
         b.   For lots with two (2) or more street frontages, this standard
shall be applied separately to each adjacent park strip on each street
frontage.
      3.   Plants which have thorns, spines, or other sharp, rigid parts are
hazardous to pedestrians and bicyclists, and are difficult to walk across and
are prohibited.
      4.   Gravel, Rocks, And Boulders: Because rock, gravel and other hard
surface materials as a ground cover retain and emit heat during the summer
months when water is scarce, they may not be used within a thirty six inch
(36") radius (72 inch diameter) of any street tree, unless an operable
irrigation system is provided. Otherwise, gravel, rocks, and boulders, may be
used on portions of the park strip as permitted in this Chapter.
      5.   Boulders as an accent material are limited to thirty six inches
(36") in height, and may not be arranged in a manner that creates a continuous
visual obstruction. Any boulder raised above the curb height shall be set back
from the curb by at least twenty four inches (24").
      6.   Paving Materials: Paving materials in park strips shall be limited
to poured concrete, concrete pavers, brick pavers, or natural stone pavers, and
may be used only in portions of a park strip as a carriageway to provide for
safe and convenient access across park strips to and from vehicles that may
park at the curb.
         a.   Carriageways shall be not more than four feet (4') in width and
shall be located so as to provide the most direct route from the curb to the
sidewalk.
      7.   Retaining Walls, Fences And Other Similar Structural Encroachments:
Retaining walls, fences, steps, raised planter boxes and other similar
structural encroachments in park strips are only permitted when specifically
approved in an approved General Development Plan and have been reviewed by the
engineering department pursuant to adopted standards and/or recognized
engineering principles. (Ord. 2022-03, 6-7-2022)

TITLE 11
FLOOD CONTROL REGULATIONS
CHAPTER 1
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
SECTION:
11-1-1: Statutory Authorization
11-1-2: Findings Of Fact
11-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
11-1-4: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
11-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The state legislature has, in Utah Code Annotated section 10-8-84, delegated
the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain as set forth in
this title. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare. These flood losses are created by the cumulative
effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights
and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable
to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this title uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)

DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
11-2-1: Definitions Of Words And Phrases
11-2-1: DEFINITIONS OF WORDS AND PHRASES:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
title its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows, active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition,
and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation of the Base Flood, relative to the
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM).
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building:
   A.   Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B,
C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building
in zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of
pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the
water; and
   B.   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case
of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, "elevated building" also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated building" also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building",
even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the
breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the national flood
insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for

inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to

interior; or
      2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the North
American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after September 15, 2022, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain
management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start
of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty

on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zones A, AE, A1-30, A99, AR, AO, AH, V,
VO, VE, or V-30.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub.L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this title when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this title. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10),
(d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the national flood insurance program
regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical
Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

administer and implement the provisions of this title and other appropriate
sections of 44 CFR (national flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to
floodplain management. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-4-2: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:
   A.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to
the provisions of this title.
   B.   Review permit applications to determine whether a proposed building
site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding.
   C.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this title.
   D.   Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   E.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation.
   F.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management
agency.
   G.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   H.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
section
11-3-2 of this title, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
chapter 5 of this title.
   I.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
   J.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE or AH on the community FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'); provided,
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision).
   K.   Where Base Flood Elevation data are utilized in Zone A, obtain and
maintain records of the lowest floor and floodproofing elevations for new and
substantially improved construction. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 2022-05,
9-6-2022)
11-4-3: PERMIT PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application Information Required: Application for a development permit
shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/
her, and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale
showing the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape
alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of
manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of
special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:
      1.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
      2.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential
structure shall be floodproofed;
      3.   A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect
that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing
criteria of subsection
11-5-2B of this title;
      4.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
      5.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection
11-4-2A of this chapter.
   B.   Considerations: Approval or denial of a development permit by the
floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this title
and the following relevant factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      9.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or
erosion damage for the proposed use;
      10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-4-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Appeal Board: The appeal board, as established by the community, shall
hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of
this title. The hearing officer is hereby appointed as the appeal board. (Ord.
07-11, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 2012-07, 4-30-2012)
   B.   Authority Of Appeal Board: The appeal board shall hear and render
judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in
the enforcement or administration of this title.
   C.   Further Appeal: Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the
appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Records Maintained; Reporting: The floodplain administrator shall
maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances
to the federal emergency management agency upon request.
   E.   Historic Places: Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of
historic places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.
   F.   Lot Size: Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
11-4-3B2 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Conditions May Be Attached: Upon consideration of the factors noted
above and the intent of this title, the appeal board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this title.
   H.   Flood Level Increase Not Permitted: Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
   I.   Repair Of Historic Structures: Variances may be issued for the repair
or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites For Granting: Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   K.   New Construction And Substantial Improvements: Variances may be issued
by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other
development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use;
provided, that:
      1.   The criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are
met; and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-4-5: PENALTY:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this title and
other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this title by
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a class B misdemeanor. Any person who violates this title or fails
to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code for each violation and, in addition, shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007; amd. 2012 Code)

hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   C.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')

the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community FIRM on sites: a)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; b) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision; c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision; or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      3.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-
30, AH and AE on the community FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this subsection be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation; or
         b.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement.
   E.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community FIRM either:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
      3.   Meet the permit requirements of subsection
11-4-3A of this title, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in subsection D of this section. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-5-3: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
   A.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections
11-1-2,
11-1-3 and
11-1-4 of this title.
   B.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
11-3-3 and
11-4-3 of this title and the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section
11-3-2 or subsection
11-4-2H of this title.
   D.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
   E.   All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-5-4: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
11-3-2 of this title are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   C.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection
 11-4-3A1 of this title, are satisfied.
   D.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
07-11, 5-15-2007)
11-5-5: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
11-3-2 of this title are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
   A.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations; provided, that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 07-11, 5-15-2007)

12-1-102: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The City Council of North Salt Lake City finds that the enforcement of this
Code and applicable State codes throughout the City is an important public
service. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public's health,
safety, and quality of life. The City Council recognizes that enforcement
starts with the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied
in administrative code enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The City
Council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a
combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain
compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative
code enforcement action may require the City Attorney to file a judicial action
to gain compliance. (Ord. 2018-08, 9-4-2018)
12-1-103: SCOPE:
The provisions of this title may be applied to all violations of this Code. It

additional remedy available for enforcement of those ordinances. (Ord. 2018-08,

12-1-105: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RIGHT:
The City has sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal
case for the violation of any of its ordinances. The City may choose to file
both, or one or the other. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in
no way interfere with the City's right to prosecute City ordinance violations
as criminal offenses. The City may use any of the remedies available under the
law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the City chooses to file both
civil and criminal charges for the same day of violation, no civil penalties
may be assessed, but all other remedies are available. (Ord. 2018-08, 9-4-2018)
12-1-106: EFFECT OF HEADING:
Title, chapter, part and section headings contained herein shall not be deemed
to govern, limit, modify, or in any manner affect the scope, meaning, or intent
of the provisions of any title, chapter, part, or section hereof. (Ord. 2018-
08, 9-4-2018)
12-1-107: VALIDITY OF TITLE - SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision of
this title is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The City Council of this
City hereby declares that it would have adopted this title and each section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, clauses,
phrases, portions, or provisions be declared invalid or unconstitutional. This
section shall apply to all amendments heretofore or hereafter made to this
title. (Ord. 2018-08, 9-4-2018)
12-1-108: NO MANDATORY DUTY - CIVIL LIABILITY:
It is the intent of the City Council that in establishing performance standards
or establishing an obligation to act by a City officer or employee, these
standards shall not be construed as creating a mandatory duty for purposes of
tort liability if the officer or employee fails to perform his or her directed
duty or duties. (Ord. 2018-08, 9-4-2018)
12-1-109: GENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION OF ORDINANCES:

or order by the District Court within thirty (30) days after the decision is

proceedings, including transcripts of hearings when necessary. The

required costs. The petitioning party's failure to properly arrange for copies
of the record, or to pay the full costs for the record, within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the petition for review was filed shall be grounds for
dismissal of the petition. If a transcript of a hearing cannot be prepared
because the tape recording is incomplete or unintelligible, the District Court
may, in its discretion, remand the matter to the Administrative Law Judge for a
supplemental proceeding to complete the record. The District Court may limit
the scope of the supplemental proceeding to issues that, in the court's
opinion, need to be clarified.
   D.   The District Court's review is limited to the record of the
administrative decision that is being appealed. The court shall not accept nor

CHAPTER 6
PLANNED UNIT, CONDOMINIUM, RECREATIONAL VEHICLE AND MOBILE HOME DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
13-6-1: Planned Unit Developments; Special Requirements
13-6-2: Condominium Subdivisions
13-6-3: Mobile Home Parks, Mobile Home Subdivisions And Recreational Vehicle
Parks: Special Requirements
13-6-1: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of planned unit development (PUD) is to permit
flexibility in land use regulations and for the consolidation of open spaces by
clustering dwelling units, in order to preserve natural features, allow a
variety of land uses, provide meaningful and usable open spaces, and to make
efficient use of essential infrastructure and public facilities. The
application of planned unit development concept is intended to encourage
neighborhoods, housing, design, open space and facilities compatible with the
present living environment in the City as described by the General Plan, while
at the same time ensuring compliance with practices which will assure the
health, safety and public welfare of the future inhabitants of the planned unit
development, as well as maximizing the energy utilization efficiency of the
project. In exchange for the additional services provided by the developer in a
planned unit development, this chapter will allow for increased intensity of
buildings and more flexible uses of the land.
   B.   The PUD approach is expected to result in development that is superior
to what could be obtained through ordinary lot-by-lot development. It is not
intended to circumvent conventional land use regulations. The City may apply
the flexibility of the planned unit development regulations, when the
development, through its design and establishment, will provide benefits that
may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
      1.   The stabilization and preservation of the existing or planned land
uses in abutting areas and surrounding residential neighborhoods;
      2.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such
as natural topography, vegetation and geologic features, and the prevention of
soil erosion;
      3.   Preservation of buildings which are architecturally or historically
significant or contribute to the character of the City;
      4.   Maximizing and preserving vegetation and open space and/or other
special development amenities to provide light, air and privacy, to buffer
abutting properties and to provide active and passive recreation opportunities
for residents of the planned development and/or the community;
      5.   Minimize significant through traffic impacts on adjacent residential
neighborhoods;
      6.   Provide an appropriate transition or buffering between uses of
differing intensities both on site and off site; and
      7.   Provide safe and convenient vehicle and pedestrian connections
between adjacent uses.
   C.   In return for greater flexibility in site development, the PUD
introduces some special requirements and standards for design approval. These
conditions will be employed to maximize quality of site design. They will not
be used to cause undue delays nor unwarranted increase in costs, when compared
to more conventional development. The PUD process will not be used as a device
to force a decrease in residential density below that otherwise allowed by the
comprehensive plan and underlying zoning.
   D.   Planned Unit Developments Approval: A development which is to be
developed as a PUD shall be processed in the same manner as subdivisions. PUD
developments shall comply with the underlying zoning requirements except as
specifically varied by this section.
   E.   Deviation From Design And Improvement Standards: Requests for design
deviations, other than those outlined in this section or as approved by
development agreement in conjunction with a P-District rezone, may only be
approved as a legislative decision by the City Council. Where, in the opinion
of the City Council, the literal enforcement of the design and improvement
standards in this Title would result in an unreasonable utilization of land and
water or undue hardship due to unique circumstances compliance with one or more
of the design and improvement standards may be waived, according to the
following procedure:
      1.   Application: Application for a modification of design standards
shall be made on a form provided by the City and shall include:
         a.   A description of the land to be developed;
         b.   An identification of the title provision from which the
modification is requested;
         c.   A description of the peculiar physical conditions pertaining to
the land in question and which do not pertain to other lands in the general
area;
         d.   A description of the hardships which will accrue to the detriment
of the property owner if the requested modification is not granted;
         e.   A nonrefundable modification review fee, where established and
payable to the City, in accordance with the Comprehensive Fee Schedule as
adopted by resolution of the City Council.
      2.   Public Hearing; Notice: The Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing before making a recommendation on the requested modification. Notice of
said public hearing shall be given in accordance with USC 10-9a-205 as a class
B notice.
      3.   Recommendation To City Council: The Planning Commission shall review
the modification application and shall submit its written recommendations for
approval or disapproval of such application to the City Council, along with
written reasons therefore within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of said
application at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission may at its own discretion conditionally approve a
preliminary plat subject to approval of the modification by the City Council,
or may table action on a preliminary plat until the City Council has acted on
the modification request.
      4.   Decision Of City Council: The City Council may approve the requested
modification upon making a finding based upon the record submitted that the
issuance of the modification will not be detrimental to the interest of the
public safety, health or welfare, the proposed development substantially
complies with the City General Plan and adopted Zoning Ordinance, and the
proposed modification will result in improved overall development design.
      5.   Records Maintained: A record of all correspondence, recommendations,
submissions and official action regarding all design modifications applications
shall be maintained permanently by the City as a public record.
   F.   P-District Developments: PUD developments in conjunction with a Planned
(P) District rezone shall also require the approval of a development agreement
by the City Council which includes all design standard variations.
   G.   Planned Unit Developments To Meet Use Limitations Of Districts Wherein
Located:
      1.   Land uses permitted within a PUD subdivision shall comply with the
underlying zone district or the negotiated terms contained in an approved P-
District development agreement. Multi-family attached dwellings shall only be
allowed to the extent permitted in the underlying zone.
      2.   The density allowed in a residential PUD shall be determined by
calculating the net developable area of the development divided by the minimum
land area required per dwelling unit within the zone district. Net developable
area is defined as the total development parcel less the area required for
private or public road rights of ways and including the required adjacent
pedestrian walkways and park strips.
   H.   Development Standards:
      1.   Area: No planned unit development shall have an area less than that
approved by the Planning Commission as adequate for the proposed development.
      2.   Arrangement Of Structures:
         a.   Open Space: The Planning Commission shall require such
arrangements of structures to consolidate and maximize usable open spaces for
the enjoyment and convenience of future tenants of the development. Care shall

govern the processing of condominium record of survey maps pursuant to the
requirements of the condominium ownership act, Utah Code Annotated title 57,
chapter 8. Said procedures and requirements shall supplement zoning, site
development, health, building and other ordinances applicable to a particular
condominium project, and shall apply to the approval of such projects involving
new construction, as well as those involving the conversion of existing
structures. In addition, condominium projects which contemplate dedication of
real property or improvements for the use of the public, or condominium
projects in which units are not contained in existing or proposed buildings,
shall also be considered subdivisions requiring compliance with all applicable
codes of the City.
   B.   It is the intent of this chapter to establish a reasonable process
whereby the City can assess the impact of mixing collective and individual
ownerships, as presented in a particular condominium project, upon the public
health, safety, convenience and general welfare of present and future
inhabitants of the City. In the case of commercial or residential conversions
of existing buildings, corrections of building code violations, the upgrading
of vehicle parking facilities and safety of common functional elements of the
structure or structures are of prime importance. It is also recognized the
conversion of existing apartments or similar multi-family rental dwelling
structures present the potential of relocation hardship to existing tenants,
especially senior citizens, and warrants that reasonable notice and disclosure
requirements be established by the City to minimize said hardships.
   C.   Application Requirements: The owner or developer of a proposed
condominium project desiring approval shall file an application with the
Community Development Department in accordance with applicable subdivision
process or plat amendment. In addition to the subdivision application
requirements the following shall also be submitted:

Annotated section 57-8-13, as amended, which shall be made by a registered Utah
land surveyor. In addition, said map or an additional site plan shall include
diagrammatic floor plans identifying boundaries of the project units,
convertible and expandable areas or spaces and common areas. Said map or plan
should designate the intended use of common areas (e.g., storage, recreational,
parking for guests as opposed to unit owners, open space, etc.) and should
indicate whether such common areas are to be open to the public, assigned to
specific units or semiprivate and available only to unit owners. Said map or
site plan shall also identify and describe in detail the location of existing
or proposed driveways, pedestrianways, curb cuts, walls, structures, fences,
landscaping and sprinkling systems.
      2.   The proposed condominium declarations and bylaws.
      3.   Where conversion of an existing building is proposed as part of the
condominium project, a property report and code analysis, prepared by a
licensed architect or engineer, including the following information with the
plan for proposed improvements, renovations and repairs:
         a.   The age of the building or buildings.
         b.   The general conditional, useful life and capacity of the
building's structural elements, including the roof, foundations, mechanical
system, electrical system, plumbing system, boiler, and other structural
elements.
         c.   The age and condition of all underground utility systems,
including meters, and identifying utility improvements required to provide
separate meters and services to individual units.

to meet existing Building Codes.
         e.   All known conditions which may require repair or replacement
within the next succeeding five (5) year period.
         f.   The property report shall certify that the structure or
structures conform to the International Building Code minimum standards, or the
owner shall present plans to bring the structure or structures into conformity
with said standards prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy.
         g.   Where it is determined that physical conditions in an existing
building do not allow the strict application of the International Building Code
standard, the City Board of Appeals, as provided for in the International
Building Code, shall review all requests to vary from these standards and may
grant variances or approve alternates where it is determined the intent of the
requirement will be met. In any event, there shall be disclosure to buyers of
any conditions that do not meet code or standards set by the City.
      4.   Proof of notice to tenants as required by section K below shall be
required before final approval, but may be submitted, at the owner/developer's
option, after preliminary plat approval is obtained from the Planning
Commission.
      5.   To assist the City to defray costs involved with the review of the
project, fees shall be submitted with a preliminary plat application as
outlined in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule.
   D.   Copies Routed: Upon receipt of a completed application for approval of
a condominium project, the Community Development Department staff shall route
copies of the application and development plans in the same manner as a
standard subdivision as outlined in chapter 5 of this title.

mechanical, plumbing or utility systems, recreational areas, landscaping and
parking areas. The declarations shall also restrict the use of any individual
residential dwelling unit to single "families", as defined in section
10-1-47 of the City Code. The staff shall also review said declaration to
require appropriate disclosure of any unusual circumstances, variances or
conditions placed upon the condominium project for approval.
         b.   Plans And Related Documents: The staff shall review the plans and
related documents to determine whether the project conforms to applicable
requirements of this Title, the status or extent of nonconforming rights,
applicable conditions imposed upon the building or use by ordinance, variance,
conditional use permit and/or prior approval under a PUD, clustered or group
dwelling plan. If the planning staff finds there are violations of applicable
zoning ordinances or requirements, the staff may recommend denial of the
condominium project until such violations have been corrected or requirements
completed or bonded for prior to final approval by the Planning Commission.
      2.   Building Inspection Staff Review:
         a.   Upon receipt of the application for approval of a condominium
project, the Building Inspection Department shall review the proposed building
plans for new construction and/or in the case of a conversion project, the
property report and plan of improvement, renovations and repairs to determine
conformance with applicable building codes. In the case of a conversion, the
department shall require inspections of the property and may require
supplementation, revision and resubmission of the property report where
necessary.
         b.   In the preliminary review report to the Planning Commission, the
Building Official shall note corrections, repairs and replacements which must
be made to bring the structures into code compliance, together with a list of
renovation improvements proposed by the owner/developer which are not required
by code. The Building Official shall also list any requirements of the
International Building Code that needs Board of Appeals consideration due to
unique circumstances associated with the structure, as provided in City Code
9-3-1. The Building Official may then recommend denial until such time as
existing violations of code are corrected or may recommend preliminary approval
of the project and building report subject to correction of the violations
prior to final approval.
      3.   Fire Marshal Review: The Fire Marshal shall inspect each structure
proposed for conversion and shall submit a report thereon to the City outlining
the conditions of the structures as they relate to fire safety. The Marshal
shall stipulate those conditions requiring improvement, prior to occupancy, in
the report.
   F.   Planning Commission Consideration: Upon completion of the
recommendations of the development review staff, the matter shall be set for
consideration by the Planning Commission in the same manner prescribed for a
subdivision or plat amendment as provided in this Title.

      2.   Meets the requirements of the condominium ownership act;
      3.   That proper notice to tenants has been given; and
      4.   That in every way the project is ready for preliminary approval.
   H.   Preliminary Approval: If the Planning Commission finds that the project
substantially complies with the above mentioned criteria but that certain facts
of the proposal require changes or modifications prior to final approval, or
that tenant notification has not been completed, the Planning Commission may
grant conditional preliminary approval to the project with instructions as to
what criteria must be met prior to submission for final approval by the
Community Development Director.
   I.   Disapproval: If the Planning Commission finds the project in conflict
with the ordinances of the City and/or the state and is not in the best
interests of the City as a whole and/or specific neighborhood in which the
project is proposed to be located, or if it is not satisfied with the site
development plans of the project, the Planning Commission may disapprove the
project specifying in detail the reasons for disapproval.
   J.   Notice: As part of the application for approval of a condominium
project, when said project involves the conversion of an existing structure
where the structure has been occupied by residential or commercial tenants
prior to application for conversion, the owner/developer shall provide notice
of intended conversion to said tenants by certified mail. This notice
requirement shall not apply to a structure that was vacant and remained so
during the year prior to filing of the developer's application for conversion.
Such notice shall include:
      1.   The proposal for the conversion of the building to a condominium
project;
      2.   The established dates of construction period and termination of
occupancy which shall not be less than sixty (60) days from the date notice is
served upon occupants or expiration of individual leases, whichever is longer;
      3.   The disclosure of the sales price for each unit shall be no greater
than the price initially advertised and offered to the general public at such
time as when the condominiums are offered for public sale;
      4.   Relocation information for the tenants specifying available
alternative housing relocation resource agencies and organizations and a plan
of any services to be voluntarily provided by the owner/developer.
   K.   Dissemination Of Notice: A copy of said notice, together with a list
prepared by the owner/developer identifying names, apartment or unit numbers,
approximate ages, rental rates and other known special disabilities or factors
affecting relocation needs of the tenants, shall be submitted to the Davis
County Housing Authority and any applicable social services department of the
County or State to advise said agencies of the conversion and/or solicit their
assistance with relocation services. No final approval of such a conversion
project shall be granted by the Planning Commission until the owner/developer
has provided proof of notice by certified mail or subsequent proof of actual
delivery by method of services allowed under state law of such notices and
relocation information as required above, and any plans for relocation services
to be voluntarily provided by the owner/developer and the time designated
therein (a minimum of sixty (60) days) has expired.
   L.   Protest Review Procedure: When a tenant of a residential dwelling has
received written formal notice of eviction without cause and without at least
sixty (60) days notice of conversion required above and has reason to believe
that notice was issued because of a proposed condominium project, he may,
within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice of eviction, initiate an
appeal regarding the issue of proper notice to the Community Development
Director, or designee. The filing of such a protest shall stay the issuance of
any approval or issuance of any permits for the structure in question for a
period not to exceed thirty (30) days and the matter shall be set for hearing
before the Planning Commission.
   M.   Investigation: Upon filing a tenant appeal, the City staff shall
institute an investigation to determine if the notice requirements set forth
above were satisfied. They shall then report their findings to the Planning
Commission within ten (10) days of filing of the appeal. (Ord. 93-5, 7-6-1993,

those in which mobile home parks are located; and to protect other land use
values contiguous to or near mobile home or recreational vehicle developments.
   C.   Location:
      1.   Mobile Homes: No mobile home shall be located anywhere within the
corporate boundaries of the City except in a licensed mobile home park or
approved mobile home subdivision. Emergency or temporary parking of any
unoccupied mobile home outside a licensed mobile home park or mobile home

hours. This limitation does not apply to unoccupied mobile homes in licensed
mobile home sales areas.
      2.   Recreational Vehicles:

living quarters except in designated camping areas or recreational vehicle
parks.
         b.   Recreational vehicles which are unoccupied for living space may
be stored on an owner's private residential lot, provided the parking complies
with the regulation in section 10-6-6 of this Title. Long term commercial
storage of recreational vehicles, maintenance operations, reconstruction or
construction activities are permitted within zoning districts allowing such
uses.
   D.   Standards And Requirements:
      1.   Determination Of Compliance: The Planning Commission shall review
the proposed development plan to determine its compliance with all portions of
the City General Plan and, among other things, shall attempt to make sure that
such development will constitute a residential environment of sustained
desirability and stability and that it will not adversely affect amenities in
the surrounding area. Standards higher than the minimum standards contained in
this Title may be required if necessary for local conditions of health, safety
and protection of property, and to ensure that the development will mix
harmoniously with contiguous and nearby existing and planned uses.
      2.   Required Facilities: The Planning Commission shall not approve any
application for mobile home park, recreational vehicle park or mobile home
subdivision if the developer cannot provide required water supplies and
facilities, waste disposal systems, storm drainage facilities, access or
improvements, or if the developer cannot assure that the development will be
completed within twelve (12) months, or if the Planning Commission determines
there would be unusual danger of flood, fire or other hazard, or if the
proposed development would be of such character or in such a location that it
would:
         a.   Create excessive costs for public services and facilities;
         b.   Endanger the health or safety of the public;
         c.   Unreasonably hurt or destroy the environment;
         d.   Cause excessive air or water pollution, or soil erosion; or
         e.   Be inconsistent with any adopted general or specific plan of the
area in which it is to be placed.
      3.   Standards And Requirements Specified; Exception: The development
shall conform to the following standards and requirements, unless modified by
an approved planned unit development plan:
         a.   The area shall be in one (1) ownership, or if in several, the
application for approval of the development shall be filed jointly by all
owners of the property included in the plan.
         b.   A strip of land at least fifteen feet (15') wide surrounding the
entire park shall be left unoccupied by mobile homes, recreational vehicles,
storage buildings, service buildings, garages or any accessory buildings or
uses, and shall be planted and maintained in lawn, shrubs or trees, with an
approved durable permanent wall or fence designed to afford privacy to the
development.
         c.   All storage and solid waste receptacles outside the confines of
any mobile home or recreational vehicle shall be housed in a closed structure
compatible in design and construction to the mobile homes, and to any service
buildings within the development; all patios, carports, garages and other
additions shall be compatible in design and construction with the mobile home.
The service buildings shall be constructed in accordance with standard
commercial practice and kept in good repair. In mobile home developments where
units will be situated with long axis perpendicular to the street, streets will
run in a north-south direction to the greatest extent possible. This is to
promote solar orientation of the units.
         d.   In addition to meeting the above requirements and conditions, and
conforming to the other laws of the City, all mobile home parks, recreational
vehicle parks, and mobile home subdivisions shall also conform to all
applicable state regulations. In the event of any conflict between said
regulations and this chapter, this chapter shall take precedence where its
regulations are more strict, and the provisions of the state regulations shall
take precedence where such regulations are more strict.

park and mobile home subdivision shall provide and maintain underground utility
service to every mobile home stand or lot including, but not limited to, water,
sewer, power, natural gas (mobile home parks only), and telecommunications.
      5.   Inspection And Special Regulation Of Mobile Homes: Mobile homes are
considered by the City to be less durable and less resistant to deterioration
than are conventional homes; therefore, all mobile homes which are used for
human habitation, whether conforming or nonconforming, and whether located in
mobile home parks, in mobile home subdivisions or on bona fide farms and
ranches, shall be subject to the following special regulations:
         a.   Permits are required for mobile home set up, plumbing and
electrical hookups, and such hookups shall be made only by licensed plumbers
and electricians.
         b.   A certificate of compliance is required for all mobile homes
within the City, whether occupied or awaiting occupancy, and may be obtained
from the building official following an inspection wherein the mobile home is
found to meet the safety, sanitary and structural standards adopted by the
City. The state or federal inspection certificate will be honored in lieu of a
certificate of compliance.
      6.   Compliance With Other Regulations: Any mobile home or recreational
vehicle located in any permitted area shall comply with and conform to all
other zoning laws, rules and regulations, and building, plumbing, electrical
and fire prevention codes, and all other codes and requirements applicable to a
structure or building erected within the district in which said mobile home or
recreational vehicle is located.
      7.   Guarantees:
         a.   For mobile home parks and recreational vehicle parks, adequate
and reasonable guarantees must be provided for permanent retention of open
spaces and for the maintenance of roadways, storage facilities, service
facilities and landscaping resulting from the application of these regulations.

open spaces and for the maintenance of roadways, storage facilities, service
facilities and landscaping resulting from the application of these regulations.

of covenants, conditions, restrictions, and easements (CCRs) which shall
provide for a home owner's association (HOA) or management entity responsible
for the maintenance of all common areas and private infrastructure.

for both yearly maintenance and long range reserve projects or maintenance.
            (4)   The developer shall implement any reasonable steps in the
creation of the appropriate accounts and funding sources for the HOA yearly
operations and maintenance costs prior to occupancy of any units in the park.
The developer shall ensure that said accounts are funded in a manner to cover
ongoing maintenance costs during construction of all common facilities and
units, so long as the developer remains in control of the park.
            (5)   The declaration shall require a reinvestment fee, or other
mechanism as permitted by law, for the purposes of funding the improvements in
perpetuity. The reinvestment fee shall apply to all closings within the park in
perpetuity, including initial closings from the developer to a buyer and all
subsequent closings. The reinvestment fee shall be used to fund the reserve and
operating funds for the park.
            (6)   The developer shall provide a management plan and a first
year budget at build out demonstrating the viability of the park to meet its
obligations including proposed monthly or annual assessment. The management
plan developed by the applicant shall outline standards of operation and
remedies for failure to comply with those standards, as well as a single
responsible person or entity for its administration and communication with the
City.
            (7)   The City and the Developer may enter into a formal
Development Agreement when specific PUD performance standards are imposed or
deviation in design standards have been approved.
         b.   In any case, when a mobile home park or recreational vehicle park
is owned by more than one (1) person, the owners shall establish and appoint a
park manager. The manager shall be authorized to receive, process and represent
fully the interests of the owners in respect to continuing management and
maintenance of the park.
         c.   A prerequisite to the operation of any mobile home park or
recreational vehicle park in the City shall be the obtaining of an annual
business license from the City.
         d.   In the event a mobile home or recreational vehicle park is not
completed according to approved plans, or operated and maintained according to
the approved management plan, the annual business license may be denied or
revoked. The mobile homes or recreational vehicles and associated property and
facilities shall be removed, and all services discontinued before any part of
the land within the development planning area may be used for any other
purpose, or be subdivided.
         e.   The premises on which any mobile home is located, used or
occupied shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and sanitary condition. The
accumulation of any rubbish, waste, weeds, inoperative vehicles or other
unsightly material thereon shall constitute a public nuisance and a violation
of this Title. Reasonable guarantees to assure compliance with this requirement
will be required of the developer and/or owner as a condition of conditional
use permit approval and ultimately the issuance of the annual City business
license.

International Building Code, as adopted by the City, and this Title.
   P.   The design of a development shall preserve insofar as possible the
natural terrain, natural drainage, existing topsoil and trees.
   Q.   Land subject to hazardous conditions, such as slides, mudflow,
rockfalls, snow avalanches, possible mine subsidence, shallow water table,
liquefaction, faults, open quarries, floods, and polluted or nonpotable water
supplies, shall be identified and shall not be developed until the hazards have
been mitigated or will be mitigated by the development and construction plans.
   R.   Existing pipelines and high-voltage powerline easements: Subdivisions
with existing underground pipelines or overhead high-voltage powerlines shall
be designed in a manner that utilizes these easements for open space or other
compatible land uses and are excluded from individual residential lots. (Ord.
93-5, 7-6-1993, eff. 7-15-1993; amd. 2012 Code; Ord. 2022-03, 6-7-2022; Ord.
2024-01, 1-16-2024)
13-8-2: SUBDIVISION LAYOUT:
   A.   Conformance To General Plan: Where a proposed subdivision includes
property identified within the City General Plan or other Master Planning
documents to include specific essential infrastructure improvements, such as
trails, active transportation improvements, or right of way improvements; the
developer shall provide a lot layout which accommodates the improvement.
   B.   Preservation Of Features: Where trees, groves, waterways, scenic
points, historic spots or other City assets and landmarks, as determined by the
City, are located within a proposed subdivision, every reasonable means shall
be provided to preserve these features.
   C.   Adjoining Existing Street: Whenever a tract to be subdivided adjoins or
contains any part of an existing or proposed street so designated on the street
plan, such part of the public way shall be platted, dedicated and improved by
the developer in the location and at the width specified. (Ord. 2024-01, 1-16-
2024)
13-8-3: LOTS:
   A.   General Requirements: All subdivisions shall result in the creation of
lots which are developable and capable of being built upon. A subdivision shall
not create lots, and no building permit shall be issued for any lots which
would make improvement impractical due to size, shape, steepness of terrain,
location of watercourses, problems of sewerage or driveway grades, or other
physical conditions.
   B.   Lots:
      1.   No single lot shall be divided by a municipal or county boundary
line.
      2.   A lot shall not be divided by a road, alley or other lot.
      3.   No wedge shaped lot shall have less than the required width for lot
frontage required in the zoning district.
      4.   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street which the lot
fronts or approximately radial to the center of street curve or cul-de-sac on
which the lot faces. The City Engineer may allow exceptions to this requirement
where considerations are warranted for solar orientation or topography.
      5.   All lots created by the subdivision shall front on a public street,
or on an approved private street, which is improved to the standards
hereinafter required, and shall have frontage equal to the minimum frontage
requirement for the zone unless modified as part of a planned unit development.
      6.   Double Frontage: Lots having double frontage shall not be approved
except where necessitated by topographic or other unusual conditions. The
Administrative Land Use Authority may require that vehicular access be
restricted for portions of double fronted lots, where access would be deemed
difficult due to topography or pose a traffic hazard.
      7.   Corner lots shall be so designed as to provide for the same quality
and size of building area as interior lots by increasing the minimum width by
ten feet (10') to accommodate the required side street setbacks.
      8.   Lot Size Standards: All lots shall conform to area requirements of
any existing zoning regulations.
      9.   Slope of Lots: All residential lots shall have an average slope of
less than thirty percent (30%). Slopes which are thirty percent (30%) and
greater shall be excluded from the building envelope designated on the plat.
All approved lots twelve thousand square feet (12,000 sf) and smaller shall
have no area of slope greater than thirty percent (30%).
      10.   For lots twelve thousand square feet (12,000 sf) and larger, the
buildable area or the building envelope as designated on the plat shall be at
least five thousand square feet (5,000 sf) in size with no single dimension of
less than fifty feet (50') and shall exclude required setbacks and easements.
      11.   Remnants parcels of property shall not be left which do not conform
to lot requirements or are not required or suitable for common open space,
private utility or public purpose.
   12.   Lot numbers shall begin with the number "1" and shall continue
consecutively through the subdivision, with no omissions or duplications. No
block designations shall be used. When a subdivision is developed in ph   ases,
the phase number shall precede each lot number. For example, phase 2 would be
numbered "201, 202, 203" etc. (Ord. 2024-01, 1-16-2024)
13-8-4: FLAG LOTS:
In older areas of the City, certain residential properties have evolved over
time with irregular shapes and sizes, some with deep rear lots. As the City
continues to see these lots subdivided, there may exist a need to develop these
deeper lots. Flag lots are one alternative to such development. However, many
problems can result from the misuse of flag lots, including increased points of
traffic access on busy or narrow streets, large paved areas created to access
rear units, a mass of new units incompatible with an existing neighborhood, and
the compromising of adequate and safe fire protection to rear dwelling units.
These problems threaten the character and stability of existing neighborhoods.
For these reasons, the following restrictions and prohibitions are established
to better control increasing residential density in predominantly single-family
neighborhoods through the use of flag lots:
   A.   Circumstances Permitting: The City discourages and restricts the
creation of flag lots. A flag lot should be permitted only under certain
limited circumstances. Flag lots are prohibited except:
      1.   Where necessary to reduce access onto major streets and
thoroughfares;
      2.   To reasonably utilize irregularly shaped land;
      3.   To reasonably utilize land with severe topography;
      4.   To provide for the protection of significant natural or
environmentally sensitive areas;
      5.   To allow a property owner reasonable use and benefit of a parcel of
land not otherwise developable; or
      6.   To achieve affordable housing goals as outlined it the City's
Moderate Income Housing Plan.
   B.   Prohibited Flag Lots: Flag lots are expressly prohibited where:
      1.   The creation of the flag lot will increase the number of access
points onto a major thoroughfare;
      2.   The density created by the flag lot would exceed the average
existing density in the immediately adjacent developed residential area; or
      3.   Flag lots for non-residential use.
   C.   The applicant proposing a flag lot must have demonstrated to the
Planning Commission that because of topographical features and/or unique
situations as set forth in subsection A of this section, creation of a flag lot
should be allowed.
   D.   Design Requirements For Flag Lot:
      1.   A flag or L-shaped lot shall be comprised of a staff portion
contiguous with the flag portion thereof.
      2.   The staff portion of said lot shall front on and be contiguous to a
dedicated public street. The minimum width of the staff portion of each flag
lot shall be thirty feet (30'). Two (2) staffs may be placed side by side and
be a minimum width of fifteen feet (15') each with a minimum shared paved
driveway width of twenty feet (20'). The staff shall not be longer than one
hundred fifty feet (150').
      3.   The flag portion of the lot shall meet the minimum lot size
requirement for the zone in which it is located. The staff portion shall not
count as part of the land area needed to meet the lot area requirement.
      4.   Flag lots must be similar in shape of the buildable area (i.e.,
rectangular or pie shaped if on a cul-de-sac) to the majority of the lots in
the immediately adjacent developed residential area.
      5.   The front side of the flag portion of the lot shall be deemed to be
that side nearest to the dedicated public street upon which the staff portion
fronts. The staff portion shall be deemed to end and the flag portion shall be
deemed to begin at the extension of the front lot line.
      6.   Flag lot units located away from the street shall be oriented to the
street or front property line.
      7.   Identification Signs:
         a.   Address Identification: All new and existing structures shall be
provided with approved address identification that is legible and visible from
the street fronting the property. Address characters shall be Arabic numbers
(shall not be spelled out) or alphabetical letters not less than four inches
(4") high with a minimum stroke width of one-half inch (½") (IFC 505.1).
         b.   The building address for the structure shall be posted
conspicuously at the driveway entrance via sign, monument, mailbox, and be
maintained in good condition and in a visible location not obstructed by
vegetation, landscaping features, walls, or fences, or other obstruction.
         c.   Any lighting provided for address identification shall be
provided in a manner where the sign is either backlit, illuminated by street
light or driveway light or if directly lit shall be in a manner that the
lighting will not shine directly into the yard or window of an adjacent
residence, and shall not be a hazard for street traffic.
         d.   A fire lane sign shall be posted near the entrance of all access
roadways and driveways reading "No Parking-Fire Lane". The sign shall be a
minimum of twelve inches by eighteen inches (12" x 18") with four inch (4")
block letter with one-half inch (½") stroke and have red letters on a white
reflective background (IFC D103.6).
         e.   Access driveways and private roadways shall not be named or
posted in a manner similar to approved street signs (color or design). All
private roadway signs shall be approved by the public works department prior to
placement at the intersection of a city street and private driveway.
      8.   All minimum required setbacks for the zone in which the flag lot is
located shall apply and all front setback distances shall be measured from the
flag portion of the lot and not from the street. Orientation, setbacks and
private yards shall conform to the following criteria:
         a.   All units shall orient to the street.
         b.   Each unit shall have both a "front" and "rear" yard on opposite
sides of the lot.
      9.   An access driveway with a minimum paved width of twenty feet (20')
shall be provided with landscaping on each side and a maximum slope of ten
percent (10%) (IFC D103.2). Landscaping shall be installed in accordance with
Title 10, Chapter 22, Water Efficient Landscape Standards. The access driveway
shall be asphalt or concrete with adequate drainage and shall be properly
maintained on a continuous basis. Where two (2) flag lots are adjacent to each
other, a common driveway for both units is required. Shared driveways shall
have a platted cross easement access and maintenance agreement. The minimum
width of the shared driveway shall be twenty feet (20') unless additional width
is required by the International Fire Code (IFC).
      10.   The access road or driveway shall be maintained by the property
owner or possessor of the premises in good condition and repair and with
adequate snow removal so as to provide free and uninhibited access by emergency
service vehicles.
      11.   Emergency Access Easements: The property owner/developer shall
grant unto the City an access easement and public utility easement along the
full width of the stem portion of the lot, permitting access to the City for
emergency and service vehicles as well as inspection personnel.
      12.   Fire Protection For Flag Lot Units: All flag lots must be reviewed
by the local fire protection agency for compliance with the International Fire
Code (IFC), for emergency vehicle access requirements prior to subdivision
approval and the issuance of a building permit. No primary residential
structure may be located on a flag lot more than five hundred feet (500') from
a public street. All measurements shall be taken from the edge of the public
right of way along the centerline of the driveway or private access driveway to
the nearest point of the primary structure.
      Upon recommendation of the Fire Marshal and in conformance to the
International Fire Code, as adopted, the Planning Commission may require one
(1) or more of the following conditions to be met as a condition for building
permit approval:
         a.   An access road or driveway which meets the following standards:
            (1)   An asphalt or concrete surface capable of supporting the
imposed load of fire apparatus weighing up to seventy five thousand (75,000)
pounds (IFC D102.1) extended to within one hundred fifty feet (150') of all
portions of the exterior walls of the first story of any building (IFC
503.1.1). If constructed of asphalt, the access road or driveway shall be a
minimum of two and one-half inches (2 ½") of asphalt over a minimum of six
inches (6") of compacted road base. If constructed of concrete, the access road
or driveway shall have a minimum of five inches (5") of concrete over a
compacted road base.
            (2)   Where such access road or driveway is adjacent to required
fire hydrants, the width shall be increased to a minimum of twenty six feet
(26')(IFC D103.1). Such required widths shall be unobstructed, including
parking of vehicles, and shall have a minimum vertical clearance of thirteen
and one-half feet (13 ½') (IFC 503.1.1).
            (3)   Reduction of the maximum grade allowed by this section for
any access road or driveway.
            (4)   The construction of a turnaround approved by the fire marshal
at a location recommended by the fire marshal (IFC 503.2.4).
            (5)   Each access road or driveway shall be identified and marked
by the property owner to the satisfaction and approval of the fire marshal (IFC
503.3).
         b.   Water Line And Hydrants:
            (1)   Installation of one (1) or more fire hydrants at the expense
of the property owner and connected by a water line from the water main sized
to meet the minimum fire flow requirements required by the IFC (IFC 507.1). The
hydrant(s) shall be located to the satisfaction and approval of the fire
marshal and city engineer. Required fire hydrant(s) shall be located on all
access roads or driveways within five feet (5') of the paved surface.
            (2)   If, in the opinion of the fire marshal, fire hydrants are
vulnerable to vehicular damage, appropriate impact protection shall be required
(IFC 507.5.6). No obstruction shall exist within a three foot (3') working area
of each fire hydrant (IFC 507.5.5).
            (3)   Hydrant shutoff valves shall be located as per city
specifications.
            (4)   The fire hydrant, water line and access road or driveway

unimpeded access to the improvements.
         c.   The installation at the time of construction, and keep
continuously maintained, a pressurized fire suppression system that complies
with the minimum standards of the International Fire Code and approved by the
fire marshal.
         d.   Other conditions as warranted and in conformance to the
International Fire Code or Urban Wildland Interface, where adopted and
applicable.
      13.   In addition to the above minimum requirements, the Planning
Commission may, as part of the conditional use permit or preliminary or final
subdivision plat approval, impose additional conditions to mitigate impacts of
the flag lot(s), such conditions include the following:
         a.   Fencing and screening requirements, including location, height,
materials, colors, and landscaping;
         b.   Limitations on lot grading, cuts and fills, drainage, retaining
wall construction, including location, materials, vegetation, and height;

6-5-2007; amd. 2012 Code; Ord. 2021-08, 10-19-2021; Ord. 2022-03, 6-7-2022;
Ord. 2024-01, 1-16-2024)
13-8-5: BLOCKS:
   A.   Block Lengths: Block lengths shall be reasonable in total design to
provide for convenient access and circulation for emergency vehicles. Blocks
shall be a minimum of three hundred feet (300') with maximum length of seven
hundred feet (700').
   B.   Midblock Pedestrian Access: Where blocks exceed six hundred feet (600')
in length, a dedicated walkway through the block at approximately the center of
the block is required where feasible. Such walkways shall have a pedestrian
easement not less than sixteen feet (16') in width. Walk improvements (paving

the easement. The use of bollards or other similar mechanism shall be required
to prevent the use of the walkway by passenger vehicles. Ownership and
maintenance of walkways shall be the responsibility of the development's
homeowner association (HOA).
   C.   Width; Variation: The width of each block shall be sufficient for an
ultimate layout of two (2) tiers of lots therein of a size required by the
provisions of this Title, unless the general layout of the vicinity, lines of
ownership, topographical conditions or locations of arterial streets or
freeways justify or make necessary a variation from this requirement. (Ord.
2024-01, 1-16-2024)
13-8-6: STREETS:
   A.   Street Requirements:
      1.   The street layout shall conform to the General Plan of the City.
      2.   Minor streets shall be laid out to discharge through traffic.
      3.   Stub streets shall be provided where needed to connect to adjacent

Local (minor) street   50 feet     27 feet
 
      6.   Minimum right of way and pavement widths for private streets within
single or two-family developments shall be the same as for public streets of
the same use category. Minimum right of way and pavement widths for townhome or
other multi-family development may be reduced in accordance with the standards
outlined in subsection 13-6-1H3 for Planned Unit Developments.
      7.   Alleys: The Land Use Authority may approve service access to the
interior of blocks where deemed to be in the public interest, in which case
such alleys must be indicated in the preliminary design plans and on the final
plat.
      8.   No half streets are permitted.
      9.   Dead end streets, including stub streets, shall be permitted only to
provide future access to adjoining property, except for dead end street systems
in cluster developments, such as planned unit developments and condominium
developments, or when necessary due to topography, other natural environmental
feature, or geologic hazard.
      10.   Streets which provide frontage and access for thirty (30) or more
lots or dwelling units are required to have a minimum of two (2) separate means
of egress.
      11.   The following standards apply to all temporary and permanent cul-
de-sacs:
         a.   Cul-de-sacs shall be terminated by a turnaround of not less than
one hundred feet (100') in right of way diameter, and the face of curb or
pavement edge radius shall be thirty eight and one-half feet (38½') or more.
         b.   Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be paved with a minimum of two inches
(2") of hot mix asphalt.
         c.   Permanent cul-de-sacs shall be paved with a minimum of three
inches (3") of hot mix asphalt.
         d.   Downhill cul-de-sacs are strongly discouraged and may only be
allowed if it can be demonstrated that surface drainage and street grade will
be controlled in a manner acceptable by the City Engineer. A surface overflow
drainage outlet will be designed to protect adjacent properties in the event
the curb face inlet(s) become obstructed or clogged.
         e.   Cul-de-sac length shall be measured from the centerline of an
intersecting street, excluding other cul-de-sacs, along the centerline of the
cul-de-sac, to a point at the center of the closed end of the cul-de-sac.
         f.   Residential Zoning Districts:
            (1)   A cul-de-sac shall not serve more than twenty (20) lots or
exceed six hundred feet (600') in length.
            (2)   The Planning Commission may recommend a deviation from design
standards to the City Council in the manner provided in subsection 13-6-1E to
increase to the maximum length of a cul-de-sac, up to one thousand feet
(1,000') in total length, when the following conditions exist:
               (A)   Physical conditions exist which preclude the ability to
establish any other practical means of access. Such conditions may include:
topography; environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, ponds, streams,
rivers, or lakes; or manmade structures that cannot be altered, moved or
relocated;
               (B)   Construction of a through street will result in undesired
cuts and fills or will damage natural terrain or drainage; or
               (C)   Buildings or existing developments block access to the
site, which would result in landlocked property or an inefficient development
plan; and
               (D)   Such an exception has received a favorable recommendation
from the South Davis Metro Fire District and the City's development review
staff.
            (3)   Exceptions to cul-de-sac length may also be subject to the
following as needed:
               (A)   Possible modified construction standards such as pavement
width and cul-de-sac diameter, quantity of fire hydrants, placement of fire
hydrants on alternating side of street, looped water lines, emergency egress
routes or plans, drainage, pedestrian easements or other reasonable measures to
ensure public safety.
         g.   Nonresidential Zoning Districts:
            (1)   A cul-de-sac shall not exceed six hundred feet (600') in
length. Cul-de-sacs longer than six hundred feet (600') may be recommended by
the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council if the development
review staff recommends that such a cul-de-sac would better preserve the
natural terrain and vegetation in the area or provide a superior street design
or provide needed access to landlocked parcels.
            (2)   The Planning Commission may require public accessways from a
cul-de-sac to provide safe circulation for pedestrians and bicyclists.
      12.   No more than four (4) streets shall enter an intersection.
      13.   Streets shall intersect at ninety degrees (90°), except where
otherwise approved as necessary by the Planning Commission upon favorable
recommendation of the City Engineer.
      14.   The centerlines of two (2) subordinate streets meeting a through
street from opposite sides shall extend as a continuous line, or the
centerlines shall be offset at least one hundred fifty feet (150').
      15.   Protection strips are not allowed adjacent to or on public streets
and rights of way.
   B.   Street Names: The following principles shall govern street names in a
subdivision:
      1.   Streets shall be numbered based on the adopted grid system wherever
practical. Alphabetic names may be considered for streets of a meandering or
diagonal nature or for other streets as specifically approved by the Land Use
Authority.
      2.   All new street names must be reviewed with the County Recorder and
the development review staff to avoid duplication or near duplication to any
streets in the City or area that may lead to confusion of response by public
safety agencies.
      3.   Each street which is a continuation of, or an approximate
continuation of, any existing dedicated street shall be given the name of such
existing street.
      4.   The words "Street", "Avenue", "Boulevard", "Place", "Way", "Court",
or other designation of any street shall be spelled out in full on the plat.
Any street name incorporating one (1) of the terms used above shall conform to
the established definition of that term. Any named street shall also have the
proper numerical coordinate as approved by the City Engineer.
      5.   Street names shall not be permitted that contain a cardinal
direction, such as north, south, east, or west, for example "South Bay Drive".
      6.   Street names which reflect the history or character of the City are
strongly encouraged.
   C.   Curvature And Alignment:
      1.   To ensure adequate sight distances, street roadway line connections
shall be made by horizontal curves. The minimum centerline radii for minor
streets shall be one hundred feet (100') and of all other streets shall be
three hundred feet (300'). On collector streets, a minimum tangent of one
hundred feet (100') shall be required between a curve and street intersection;
a minimum tangent of one hundred feet (100') shall be required between reverse
curves.
      2.   Vertical curves shall be used at all changes of grade exceeding one
percent (1%) and shall be designed to provide minimum sight distances of two
hundred feet (200') for minor streets and three hundred feet (300') for all
other streets, except that vertical curves for major streets shall be as
determined by the current specifications of the state department of
transportation.
   D.   Construction Standards For Paved Roadways For Public And Private
Streets: Minimum roadbed grading and paving for all street types shall be

13-9-4: STORM DRAINAGE:
   A.   Required Systems: Complete drainage systems for the entire development
area shall be designed by a professional engineer, licensed in the state and
qualified to perform such work, and shall be shown graphically. All existing
drainage features which are to be incorporated in the design shall be so
identified. If the final plat is to be presented in sections, a general
drainage plan for the entire area shall be presented with the first section,
and appropriate development stages for the drainage system for each section
indicated. All drainage systems shall be designed for retention of the
eightieth percentile storm precipitation in accordance with the adopted
Standards and Specifications Manual, as well as any other regulations adopted
by the State of Utah, Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
   B.   Design: The drainage systems shall be designed with:
      1.   Adequate Drainage: Ensure adequate drainage of all low points.
      2.   Designated Floodplain Regulations: Ensure applications of the
following regulations regarding development in designated floodplains:
         a.   Construction of buildings shall not be permitted in a designated
floodway with a return frequency more often than a one hundred (100) year
storm.
         b.   Building construction may occur in that portion of the designated
floodplain, as designated by FEMA, where the return frequency is between a one
hundred (100) year and a maximum probable storm provided all usable floor space
is constructed above the designated maximum probable flood level.
         c.   Where flow velocities in a floodplain are generally determined to
be under five feet (5') per second and maximum flood depth will not exceed
three feet (3'), such uses as cultivated agriculture, nurseries, parks and
recreation facilities and accessory parking may be permitted.
         d.   Any use of land is prohibited where flooding would create a
public health hazard or problem. This includes shallow wells, noncased deep
wells, sanitary landfills, septic tanks and on lot sewage disposal systems,
water treatment plants, and also sewage disposal systems not completely
protected from inundation.
         e.   Any contemplated floodplain encroachment or channeling shall be
thoroughly analyzed and its effect on stream flow determined before such
encroachment is undertaken. Any construction, dumping and filling operations in
a designated floodway constitute an encroachment and must be approved by the
Army Corps of Engineers, the Floodplain Manager and the City Engineer before
accomplishment.
         f.   No lot one (1) acre or less in area shall include any portion of
a one hundred (100) year floodplain when computing the size of the lot. All
lots containing more than one (1) acre shall contain not less than forty
thousand (40,000) square feet of land which is at an elevation at least two
feet (2') above the elevation of the one hundred (100) year recurrence interval
flood, or, where such data is not available, five feet (5') above the elevation
of the maximum flood of record.
      3.   Drainage Basin: The drainage basin as a whole shall accommodate not
only runoff from the development area but also, where applicable, the system
shall be designed to accommodate the runoff from those areas adjacent to and
"upstream" from the development itself, as well as its effects on lands
downstream. Basins by which the developer proposes to handle stormwater
drainage shall be designed for an event with a ten (10) year return period for
all storm drain pipe, and for an event with a one hundred (100) year return
period for all storm drain detention basins. The calculation must size the
detention basin, size the orifice plate and determine the amount of flow which
can be released (the release rate can be 0.2 cfs/acre).
      4.   Surface Drainage Structures: All proposed surface drainage
structures shall be indicated on the plans.
      5.   Construction Materials And Elevations: All appropriate designs,
details and dimensions needed to clearly explain proposed construction
materials and elevations shall be included in the drainage plans.
      6.   Permits: All necessary permits shall be obtained from applicable
local, state and federal agencies (i.e., state engineer, U.S. army corps of
engineers, state division of health, etc.).
      7.   Low Impact Development (LID):
         a.   All development and redevelopment that warrants compliance with
the Utah General Construction Permit (UGCP) regulation must include an LID
analysis that meets the objective of mirroring the predevelopment hydrology and
meets the objective of retaining on site. Detention basins shall retain the
required twenty four (24) hour storm equivalent, as required under the Utah
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (UPDES) general discharge permit.
         b.   Low impact development (LID) is an approach to land development
that uses various land planning and design practices and technologies to
simultaneously conserve and protect natural resource systems and reduce
infrastructure costs. LID still allows land to be developed, but in a cost
effective manner that helps mitigate potential environmental impacts.
         c.   As part of the City of North Salt Lake permit, the City requires
use of an LID approach, which includes the implementation of structural BMPs,
where practicable, that infiltrate, evapotranspire or harvest and use
stormwater for the site to protect water quality.
         d.   All development or redevelopment that warrants compliance with
the Utah general construction permit (UGCP) regulation must include an LID
analysis that meets the objective of mirroring the predevelopment hydrology and
meets the objective of retaining on site, with no discharge, the 0.6-inch,
twenty four (24) hour rainfall event. Groundwater recharge may be considered to
meet the onsite retainage requirement, where applicable and feasible. If
meeting the retention standard is technically infeasible, a rationale shall be
provided on a case by case basis for the use of an alternative design criteria.
         e.   No LID limits are defined except designs must not negatively
impact surrounding properties. The LID analysis must identify LID options
considered and list the reasons why it will be incorporated or why the
considered LIDs are not practical for the site use or conditions. Submit a
report with stormwater calculations that summarizes the analysis and results.
         f.   Suggested and preferred LIDs are outlined in the City's
"Stormwater Best Management Practices Handbook".
      8.   Postconstruction Stormwater Maintenance Plan And Agreement:
         a.   The purpose of the postconstruction stormwater maintenance plan
and agreement is to control stormwater runoff and reduce pollutants in
stormwater runoff after construction is complete and the developed site is in
operation. This is achieved by accomplishing the following:
            (1)   Controlling erosion.
            (2)   Controlling discharge of sediment into stormwater drainage
facilities or off site.
            (3)   Preventing illicit discharges into on site soils, storm
drainage facilities or off site.
            (4)   Prevention of debris and garbage from entering the stormwater
system.
         b.   A postconstruction stormwater maintenance plan must be prepared
and submitted with the plans for approval for all privately owned or maintained
facilities that warrant compliance with the UGCP regulation. The plan shall be
contained on a plan sheet of its own, rather than being a part of another plan
sheet, and is to contain at least the following:
            (1)   The site plan, including vicinity map, proposed contours,
permanent stormwater features, and landscaping.
            (2)   BMPs to accomplish the purpose of the plan. Examples of
appropriate BMPs may include those addressing operation and maintenance of
storm drainage quality control facilities, operation and maintenance of
stormwater discharge control facilities, maintenance of landscaping, good
housekeeping practices, etc.
            (3)   Showing the following for each BMP specified:
               (A)   Location and extent of specified BMPs, as appropriate.
               (B)   Detailed schedule of execution for each specified BMP, in
terms of starting time, duration, frequency, etc., as appropriate.
               (C)   Any information in addition to or different from that
shown on the BMP fact sheets as necessary to employ the BMPs on the site.
         c.   The owner of development that warrants compliance with the UGCP
regulation must submit a signed stormwater maintenance agreement using the City
of North Salt Lake agreement template. The postconstruction maintenance
agreement needs to be recorded at the Davis County recorder's office. (Ord. 93-
