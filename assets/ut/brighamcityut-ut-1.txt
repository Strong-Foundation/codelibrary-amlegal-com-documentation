   The city shall comply with all required procedures contained in the Utah
Code and as outlined in §§
30.035 through

below in this section of the city code. If any rule is in conflict with any
provision of Utah State Code governing meeting procedures for the City Council,
the City Council shall follow the provision of the Utah State Code. Unless
otherwise stated in State Code, three votes are required to approve an item or
any action.
(Prior Code, § 2.03.040) (Ord. 11-32, passed 12-1-2011)
§ 30.057 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   Public comment may be listed on the agenda of the City Council and may be
limited to residents of the city. The public comment portion of the meeting

not listed on the agenda. Members of the public shall be free to express any
idea, question or viewpoint without limitation, except for time and the manner
of the presentation. Individual members of the public shall be limited to three
minutes’ time. The Chair of the meeting shall ensure that the public comment is
civil and orderly. Personal attacks made publicly toward any person or city
employee are not allowed. Speakers are encouraged to bring their complaints
regarding employee performance through the supervisory chain of command in
accordance with the city’s personnel policies. The Chair shall use his or her
best efforts to allow the free expression of the public and keep the meeting in
order. Council members should not interrupt, argue with or otherwise interfere

been sufficient discussion of an item and all Council members have had an
opportunity to speak, the Chair can call for a motion on the item. If no motion
is received the item will be considered continued to allow further thought by
the Council members on the item. Any meeting designated as a work meeting shall
be more informal and Council members may freely participate as long as proper
decorum is maintained.

of a quorum of the Council need not be physically present at the physical
location from which the electronic meeting originates or from which the Council
members are connected to the electronic meeting in order for an electronic

shall give public notice of the meeting in accordance with state statute and
post written notice at the anchor location. The City Recorder shall provide
notice of the electronic meeting to the Council members at least 24 hours

activity. The impact fee facilities plan shall identify the demands placed upon
existing public facilities by new development activity and the proposed means
by which the city will meet those demands.
   (B)   Citywide Impact Fees Facilities Plan. The city has, through its
consultants, researched and analyzed the factors set forth in U.C.A. § 11-36a-
302 of the Impact Fees Act and has caused to be prepared a Citywide Impact Fees
Facilities Plan (“IFFP”). The IFFP has been prepared based on reasonable growth
assumptions for the city and general demand characteristics of current and
future users of facilities. The IFFP identifies the impact on system
improvements created by development activity and estimates the proportionate
share of the costs of impacts on system improvements that are reasonably
related to new development activity. As shown in the IFFP, the city has
considered all revenue sources to finance the impacts on system improvements,
including grants, bonds, interfund loans, impact fees and anticipated or
accepted dedications of system improvements. The IFFP establishes that impact
fees are necessary to maintain proposed level of service that complies with
applicable provisions of U.C.A. § 11-36a 302 of the Impact Fees Act.
   (C)   Plan certification. The IFFP includes a written certification in
accordance with U.C.A. § 11-36a-306 of the Impact Fees Act from the person or

(Prior Code, § 6.01.050) (Ord. 18-05, passed 5-17-2018)
§ 34.006 CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Impact fee calculations.
      (1)   Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-305, in calculating an impact fee, the
city may include: the construction contract price; the cost of acquiring land,
improvements, materials and fixtures; the cost for planning, surveying and
engineering fees for services provided for and directly related to the
construction of the system improvements; and debt service charges if the city
might use impact fees as a revenue stream to pay principal and interest on
bonds, notes or other obligations issued to finance the costs of the system
improvements.
      (2)   In calculating the proposed impact fees, the city has based such
amounts calculated on realistic estimates and the assumptions underlying such
estimates are more particular disclosed in the IFA.
   (B)   Previously incurred costs.
      (1)   To the extent that new growth and development will be served by
previously constructed improvements, the city’s impact fees may include public
facility costs and outstanding bond costs related to the improvements
previously incurred by the city.
      (2)   As provided in the IFA, a buy-in component is contemplated in the
analysis and therefore the interest costs associated with any outstanding storm
bond obligations have been included in the calculation of the impact fees.
(Prior Code, § 6.01.060) (Ord. 18-05, passed 5-17-2018)
§ 34.007 SCHEDULE AND FORMULA.
   (A)   Impact fee schedule or formula required. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-
402 of the Impact Fees Act, the city is required to provide a schedule of
impact fees for each type of development activity that specifies the amount of
the impact fee to be imposed for each type of system improvement or the formula
that the city will use to calculate each impact fee.
   (B)   Maximum impact fee schedule. Based on the IFA, the maximum impact fees
which the city may impose on development activity within the defined service
area is set forth in the following schedules:

§ 34.008 ADJUSTMENTS AND CREDITS.
   (A)   Adjustments.
      (1)   In accordance with U.C.A. § 11-36a-402 of the Impact Fees Act, the
city may adjust the impact fees at the time the fee is charged to respond to:
         (a)   Unusual circumstances in specific cases;
         (b)   A request for a prompt and individualized impact fee review for
the development activity of the state, a school district or a charter school
and an offset or credit for a public facility for which an impact fee has been
or will be collected; and
         (c)   To ensure that impact fees are imposed fairly.
      (2)   The impact fees assessed to a particular development may also be
adjusted should the developer supply sufficient written information, studies
and/or data to the city showing a discrepancy between the fee being assessed
and the actual impact on the system.
   (B)   Developer credits.
      (1)   In accordance with U.C.A. § 11-36a-402 of the Impact Fees Act, a
developer, including a school district or a charter school, may be allowed a
credit against impact fees or proportionate reimbursement of impact fees if the
developer:
         (a)   Dedicates land for a system improvement;
         (b)   Builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement; or
         (c)   Dedicates a public facility that the city and the developer
agree will reduce the need for a system improvement; provided that, the system
improvement is:
            1.   Identified in the city’s IFFP; and
            2.   Is required by the city as a condition of approving the
development activity.
      (2)   To the extent required in U.C.A. § 11-36a-402, the city shall
provide a credit against impact fees for any dedication of land for,
improvements to, or new construction of any system improvements provided by the
developer if the facilities are:
         (a)   Are system improvement; or
         (b)   Are dedicated to the public and offset the need for an
identified system improvement.
   (C)   Waiver for “public purpose”.
      (1)   The City Council may, on a project by project basis, authorize
exceptions or adjustments to the impact fees for development activity
attributable to:
         (a)   Low income housing;
         (b)   The state;
         (c)   A school district;
         (d)   A charter school; or
         (e)   Other development activity which the City Council determines to
have a broad public purpose.
      (2)   Waivers provided under this division (C) shall be by resolution of
the City Council.
      (3)   For development activities requesting a waiver as serving a broad
public purpose, the City Council shall find that such activities will provide
benefits to the citizens of the city as a whole and will accomplish a defined
purpose of the city’s General Plan that may otherwise require the expenditure
of city funds to accomplish. If the City Council is unable to make such a
finding, no exemption shall be provided.
      (4)   The City Council shall consider requests for exemption of
development activities due to the provision of low income housing only under
the following circumstances:
         (a)   The developer is a bona fide non-profit organization which has
the provision of low income housing as a principal objective;
         (b)   The developer has established procedures that will ensure that
the dwelling or dwellings for which the exemption is requested will remain
affordable to low income households for a period of not less than 30 years;
         (c)   The developer has established procedures that will guarantee the
long-term maintenance and upkeep of the low income housing development,
including all structures, landscaping and other site features; and
         (d)   The Planning Commission and City Council find that the project
demonstrates quality in site planning and architecture.
   (D)   Impact Fee Adjustment Committee. Requests for adjustment or waiver of
impact fees, or for developer credits, shall be reviewed by the Impact Fee
Adjustment Committee (the “Committee”), which shall be comprised of three
members, which shall be the Community and Economic Development Director, the
Chief Building Official and the City Engineer. The Director of Public Works and
the Director of Public Power shall advise the Committee, and may act as
alternate members in the event that one of the Committee members is unable to
attend. Committee members may also designate a member of their respective
departments to act as their alternate in the event they are unable to attend.
      (1)   All requests for adjustment or waiver of impact fees or developer
credits shall be submitted to the Community and Economic Development
Department, which shall forward the request to the Committee. The Committee
shall convene as needed to review all requests.
      (2)   Requests for adjustment or waiver of impact fees or developer
credits must be requested in writing by the developer, and must include
evidence supporting the request, and compiled, as applicable, in a standard
form as it relates to equivalent residential units, as defined herein.
      (3)   If the request for adjustment or waiver or developer credit is the
result of land dedication, or improvement of new public services or buildings,
then a fair market appraisal shall be made of the proposal and shall be
submitted, with any other evidence, to the Committee for review. The appraisal
shall be at the expense of the developer. Land dedication must first be
approved by the City Council.
         (a)   All submitted requests shall be reviewed by the Committee within
14 days from the date a complete application is submitted, and all decisions of
the Committee shall be submitted in writing to the developer within 30 days
following the Committee meeting.
         (b)   The Committee is authorized or deny requests for adjustment of
impact fees. In such cases, the Committee’s decision may be appealed to the
City Council.
         (c)   The committee shall make recommendations to the City Council
regarding requests for waiver of impact fees.
         (d)   Minutes of committee meetings shall be submitted to the City
Council.
         (e)   The Committee shall be subject to the requirements of the
state’s Open and Public Meetings Act (U.C.A. Title 52, Chapter 4).
      (4)   Except for the exemption of low income housing, in the event that
the City Council exempts a project from the payment of all or a portion of
impact fees, it shall establish one or more sources of funds other than impact
fees to offset funds that would otherwise be paid in the form of impact fees.
Applications for exceptions are to be filed with the city at the time the
applicant first requests the extension of service to the applicant’s
development or property.

(Prior Code, § 6.01.090) (Ord. 18-05, passed 5-17-2018)
§ 34.010 IMPACT FEE ACCOUNT AND EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   Impact fees accounting. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-601 of the Impact
Fees Act, the city will establish a separate interest bearing ledger account
for each type of public facility for which an impact fee is collected, deposit
a receipt for an impact fee in the appropriate ledger account established
herein and retain the interest earned on each fund or ledger account in the
fund or ledger account.
   (B)   Reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, the city shall prepare a
report on each fund or ledger account showing the source and expenditures as
required by law. Annually, the city shall produce and transmit to the State
Auditor a certified report in accordance with U.C.A. § 11-36a-601 in a format
developed by the State Auditor.
   (C)   Impact fee expenditures.
      (1)   Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-602 of the Impact Fees Act, the city
may expend impact fees only for a system improvement:
         (a)   Identified in the IFFP; and
         (b)   For the specific public facility type for which the fee was
collected.
      (2)   Impact fees will be expended on a first-in first-out basis.
   (D)   Time of expenditure. Except as otherwise provided by law, the city
shall expend or encumber impact fees for a permissible use within six years of
their receipt. For purposes of this calculation, the first funds received shall
be deemed to be the first funds expended.
   (E)   Extension of time. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-602 of the Impact Fees
Act, the city may hold the impact fees for longer than six years if it
identifies in writing:
      (1)   An extraordinary and compelling reason why the fees should be held
longer than six years; and
      (2)   An absolute date by which the fees will be expended.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-603 of the Impact Fees Act, the city
shall refund any impact fees paid by a developer, plus interest earned, when:
         (a)   The developer does not proceed with the development activity and
has a written request for a refund;
         (b)   The fees have not been spent or encumbered; and
         (c)   No impact has resulted.
      (2)   An impact that would preclude a developer from a refund from the
city may include any impact reasonably identified by the city, including, but
not limited to, the city having sized facilities and/or paid for, installed
and/or caused the installation of facilities based in whole or in part upon the
developer’s planned development activity even though that capacity may, at some
future time, be utilized by another development.
   (G)   Other impact fees. To the extent allowed by law, the City Council may
negotiate or otherwise impose impact fees and other fees different from those
currently charged. Those charges may, at the discretion of the City Council,
include, but not be limited to, reductions or increases in impact fees, all or
part of which may be reimbursed to the developer who installed improvements
that service the land to be connected with the city’s system.
   (H)   Additional fees and costs. The impact fees authorized herein are
separate from, and in addition to, user fees and other charges lawfully imposed
by the city and other fees and costs that may not be included as itemized
component parts of the impact fee schedule. In charging any such fees as a
condition of development approval, the city recognizes that the fees must be a
reasonable charge for the service provided.
   (I)   Fees effective at time of payment. Unless otherwise provided in the
city’s Consolidated Fee Schedule, the city will collect the impact fees prior
to final plat recording or prior to building permit issuance, as applicable.
The fees will be calculated by the city. Unless the city is otherwise bound by
a contractual requirement, the impact fees shall be determined from the fee
schedule in effect at the time of payment.
   (J)   Imposition of additional fee or refund after development. Should any
developer undertake development activities such that the ultimate acreage or
other impact of the development activity is not revealed to the city, either
through inadvertence, neglect, a change in plans, or any other cause
whatsoever, and/or the impact fee is not initially charged against all acreage
within the development, the city shall be entitled to charge an additional
impact fee to the developer or other appropriate person covering the acreage
for which an impact fee was not previously paid.
(Prior Code, § 6.01.100) (Ord. 18-05, passed 5-17-2018)
§ 34.011 CHALLENGES TO IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   Request for information. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-701, a person or
entity required to pay an impact fee who believes the impact fee does not meet
the requirements of law may file a written request for information with the
City Administrator. As required by law, the City Administrator shall, within
two weeks after the receipt of the request for information provide the person
or entity with the IFFP, the IFA and any other relevant information relating to
the impact fee.
   (B)   Advisory opinion. A potentially aggrieved person may request an
advisory opinion from a neutral third party regarding compliance of the impact
fees with the Impact Fees Act by filing such request with the office of the
Property Rights Ombudsman in accordance with the procedures and provisions of
U.C.A. Title 13, Chapter 43, known as the Property Rights Ombudsman Act. The
aggrieved party requesting an advisory opinion is not required to exhaust the
administrative appeals procedures set forth in division (C) below before
requesting an advisory opinion.
   (C)   Appeal. A person or entity that has paid impact fees under the
provisions of this chapter may challenge such impact fees pursuant to the
provisions set forth in U.C.A. Title 11, Chapter 36a, Part 7, of the Impact
Fees Act regarding challenges.
      (1)   Grounds for challenge. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-701, a person or
entity that has paid impact fees under the provisions of this chapter may
challenge:
         (a)   The impact fees;
         (b)   Whether the city complied with the notice requirements of the
Impact Fees Act with respect to the imposition of the impact fees; and/or
         (c)   Whether the city complied with other procedural requirements of
the Impact Fees Act for imposing the impact fee.
      (2)   Sole remedy. The sole remedy for challenging the notice
requirements is the equitable remedy of requiring the city to correct the
defective notice and repeat the process. The sole remedy for challenging the
impact fee is a refund of the difference between what the person or entity paid
as an impact fee and the amount the impact fee should have been if it had been
correctly calculated. Reasonable attorney’s fees may be awarded to the
substantially prevailing party to the extent provided in the Impact Fees Act.
      (3)   Imitation. A challenge to an impact fee is initiated by filing:
         (a)   An appeal to the City Council pursuant to the administrative
appeal procedures set forth herein;
         (b)   A request for arbitration as provided in U.C.A. § 11-36a-705 of
the Impact Fees Act; or
         (c)   An action in district court.
   (D)   Time restrictions. The time for filing a challenge to the impact fees
shall be filed in accordance with the time limitations set forth in U.C.A. §
11-36a-702, depending upon the type of challenge. The deadline to file an
action in district court is tolled from the date that a challenge is filed
using the administrative procedures set forth in division (C) above until 30
days on which a final decision is rendered in the administrative appeals
procedure.
      (1)   Administrative appeal procedure. The city hereby adopts an
administrative appeal procedure to consider and decide challenges to the impact
fees. Any person or entity that has paid an impact fee pursuant to this chapter
may challenge or appeal the impact fee by filing written notice of
administrative appeal with the city within 30 days after the day on which the
person or entity paid the impact fee. The notice of appeal shall set forth the
grounds for the appeal and shall include any applicable filing fees as set
forth in the city’s Consolidated Fee Schedule. Upon receiving the written
notice of appeal, the City Council shall set a hearing date to consider the
merits of the challenge or appeal. The person or entity challenging or
appealing the fee may appear at the hearing and present any written or oral
evidence deemed relevant to the challenge or appeal. Representatives of the
city may also appear and present evidence to support the imposition of the fee.
The City Council shall hold a hearing and make a decision within 30 days after
the date the challenge or appeal is filed.
      (2)   Mediation. In addition to the methods of challenging an impact fee
as provided herein, a specified public agency may require the city to
participate in mediation of any applicable impact fee in accordance with the
provisions of U.C.A. § 11-36a-704 of the Impact Fees Act. A written request for
mediation must be filed in accordance with U.C.A. § 11-36a-704 no later than 30
days after the day on which the impact fee is paid.
      (3)   Declaratory judgment action. Pursuant to U.C.A. § 11-36a-701, a
person or entity residing in or owning properly within the service area, or an
organization, association or a corporation representing the interests of
persons or entities owning property within the service area are deemed to have
standing to file a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of an
impact fee.

rate or system of charge except as provided herein shall give the city the
right to discontinue service upon five days’ written notice. Miscellaneous
loads such as general lighting of the area, laundry facilities, washroom,
recreational facilities and the like, available only to facility tenants will
be considered residential usage and served under the applicable schedule. Loads
for commercial purposes such as stores, restaurants, service stations and other

to the sanitary sewer system if the sewer is available and within 300 feet of
the property line or building.
   (B)   The property owner shall pay all current impact, connection and user
rate fees. If a property owner fails to connect to the sanitary sewer system
within a 90-day period commencing from the date of written notification or
fails to pay for the sewer service required by the city ordinances, the city
may cause the culinary water service to the property or building to be shut off
until the person has connected up to the sewer at the person’s own expense and
paid in full for all sewer service. However, a property owner may be allowed to
continue the use of an existing septic tank or cesspool until the system fails
to handle the waste or becomes a public health threat; in such case, the
property owner shall connect to the sanitary sewer system and pay all required
fees.
   (C)   Any user rate fees collected by the city prior to a sewer being
connected shall be credited back against the connection(s) and impact fees.

   Hauled wastewater shall not be permitted in the city’s sewage system without
written authorization first obtained from the POTW manager. Charges for hauled
wastewater shall be set by the City Council from time to time by resolution.
The POTW manager may refuse service to waste haulers at the POTW manager’s
discretion. See also §
52.068 of this ordinance.
(Prior Code, § 22.01.250) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)

owner shall pay all the actual expenses of installing the service line from the
property to the main sewer line, connecting to the city sewer line subject to
the city’s inspection and approval, and all other costs including the repairing
and restoring of the street in a manner satisfactory to the city.
   (C)   Where property on existing city streets is not served by a sewer line
in front of or adjacent to such property and the owner desires a sewer service
connection, the abutting property owner, in addition to paying the service
connection fee, will be required to run the line at his or her own expense to
the main sewer line, to make the connection at his or her own expense, subject
to the city’s inspection and approval, and to restore and repair the street in
a manner satisfactory to the city.
   (D)   (1)   If any abutting improved property on which is located a
residence or business, is not connected to the city sewer lines after the
effective date of this ordinance; provided, the sewage facilities are available
in sewage lines passing in front of or adjacent to such property, the city is
to discontinue service of water to such property, and shall not serve such
property with water until the connection is made and the connection charge
paid, or arranged for, and further in the event any owner of improved property
fails or refuses to make such connection prior to such date, such failure or
refusal is hereby declared to be a misdemeanor and each day that such failure
or refusal continues is hereby declared to be a separate offense and punishable
as such.
      (2)   All provisions contained in prior ordinances, in conflict with the

§ 52.122 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any User subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the POTW
manager a report containing the information described in §§
52.084(A)(7) and
52.120(B)(2) of this chapter. For all Users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
User’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
52.133 of this chapter. All sampling will be done in conformance with §

   (A)   Each User must notify the POTW manager of any significant changes to
the User’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume
of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change, including changes that
may affect slug discharges to the POTW.
      (1)   The POTW manager may require the User to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52.084 of this chapter.
      (2)   The POTW manager may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under §
52.105 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§
52.102 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
   (B)   The POTW manager may approve, deny or conditionally approve the change
based on the affects the change may have on the POTW and/or the pretreatment
program.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.050) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.125 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately notify either in
person or via a phone conversation with the POTW manager of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the User.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the User shall, unless
waived by the POTW manager, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which might be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial Users are required to notify the POTW manager
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.060) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.126 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.
   All Users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the POTW manager may require.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.070) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.127 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.

the POTW manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the POTW manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. Resampling by the industrial User is not required if the city
performs sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the city
performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the User or the city receives the results of this
sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial User. If the city performs the sampling and analysis and a violation
occurs, in lieu of the User performing the sampling and analysis, then the city
will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the User of
the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat sampling and
analysis.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.080) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.128 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the User discharges more
than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the User:
      (1)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      (2)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
      (3)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (B)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division (B) need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under §
52.124 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.120,
52.122 and
52.123 of this chapter.
   (C)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the User discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
   (D)   In the case of any new regulations under RCRA Subtitle C, § 3001,
being 42 U.S.C. § 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous
waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must
notify the POTW manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (E)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the User
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (F)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.090) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.129 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS CONSTANT.
   (A)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other
requirement by this ordinance shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW manager or other parties approved by EPA.
   (B)   All laboratory samples collected for this ordinance shall be analyzed
by a laboratory that is either certified by the state’s Department of Health
Environmental Laboratory Certification program or another laboratory approved
by the POTW manager. The following must be met for field methods or analysis
completed by the permittee: the analysis must adhere to the requirements of 40
C.F.R. part 136 and/or have been approved by the POTW manager for analysis by
the User.
(Prior Code, § 22.06.100) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.130 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the POTW manager.
      (2)   Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the POTW manager, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the POTW manager as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
52.120 and
52.122 of this chapter, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the POTW manager may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs in §
52.123 of this chapter, the industrial User is required to collect the number
of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.

operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred, and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The User has submitted the following information to the POTW
manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance;
         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

52.044(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
52.044(B)(4), (B)(5), (B)(6), (B)(7) and (B)(8) of this chapter if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or
interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the User’s prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its UPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Prior Code, § 22.13.020) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.182 BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
User’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   Violations. A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) below.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW manager, at least ten days before the date of
the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A User shall submit oral notice to the POTW manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the User becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW manager may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW manager may take an enforcement
action against a User for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The User submitted notices as required under division (C) above.
      (2)   The POTW manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW manager determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) above.
(Prior Code, § 22.13.030) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 52.195 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   When the POTW manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the POTW manager may serve upon that User a written notice of
violation.
   (B)   Within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the POTW
manager.
   (C)   Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the POTW manager
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.010) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.196 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The POTW manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for
non-compliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
User to correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
52.198 and
52.199 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.020) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.197 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   (A)   The POTW manager may order a User which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the POTW manager and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.
   (B)   Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior
to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the User as defined in §
52.043 of this chapter and required by §
52.085 of this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.030) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.198 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the POTW manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the POTW manager may issue an order to the User responsible for
the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified
time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the non-compliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.040) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.199 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the POTW manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the POTW
manager may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the User to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.050) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.200 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   (1)   When the POTW manager finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the POTW manager may fine such User in an amount not to exceed
$10,000.
      (2)   Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis.
      (3)   In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty according to the city’s Purchasing and Accounts
Receivable (P.A.R.S.) Policy.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the POTW manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the POTW manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the User’s
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the User. The POTW manager may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Prior Code, § 22.10.060) (Ord. 22-17, passed 8-18-2022)
§ 52.201 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The POTW manager may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after
informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The POTW manager may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW
manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW manager may
allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the POTW manager that the period of endangerment has passed
unless the termination proceedings in §
52.202 of this chapter are initiated against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the POTW manager prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
52.197 or
52.202 of this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension of a permit and/or discharge to the POTW.

§ 52.202 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
52.104 of this chapter, any User who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of access to the User’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or

this option by the POTW manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User.

individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the POTW manager may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction through the city’s Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order
or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the User. The
POTW manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a

costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
         (c)   In the event an industrial User discharges pollutants which
cause the city to violate any conditions of its UPDES permit and the city is
fined by EPA or the state for such violations, then such industrial Users shall
be fully liable for the total amount of the fines and civil penalties assessed
against the city by the EPA and/or the state and administrative costs incurred.
         (d)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User’s violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User and any other factor as
justice requires.
         (e)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
(Prior Code, § 22.11.020)
      (3)   Criminal prosecution.
         (a)   A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of

falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
Class C misdemeanor, and shall be subject to penalties as prescribed by law.
(Prior Code, § 22.11.030)
      (4)   Remedies non-exclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance
are not exclusive. The POTW manager may take any, all or any combination of
these actions against a non-compliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response
plan. However, the POTW manager may take other action against any User when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW manager is empowered to take more than
one enforcement action against any non-compliant User.

§ 93.049 NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Administration. This subchapter shall be administered and enforced by
the Code Enforcement Officer. In case of nuisances involving criminal
violations, or violations of codes typically administered and enforced by the
Police Department, this subchapter may also be administered and enforced by the
Police Department.
   (B)   Finding of nuisance. If a Code Enforcement Officer finds that a
nuisance exists, they shall attempt to have the responsible person abate the
nuisance. Although the Code Enforcement Officer’s first step in correcting or
abating the nuisance will always be to seek voluntary compliance, the Code
Enforcement Officer may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies available
pursuant to Ord. 13-23, contained herein, state law or common law in order to
abate the nuisance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit
the city from engaging in its standard prosecution practices. Therefore, the
city may prosecute violators of city ordinances or state laws without first
having to comply with the provisions of this subchapter, even though the
activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under this
subchapter. Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted to prevent the city
from enforcing applicable city ordinances or codes without first treating the
offending conduct, situation, activity and the like as a nuisance pursuant to
this subchapter.
   (C)   Repeated short-term nuisances. It is recognized by this subchapter
that certain nuisances by their nature may occur for a short period of time
such that at the time of contact with the responsible person by the Code
Enforcement Officer, the nuisance may not be occurring or evident. In such
cases, the Code Enforcement Officer shall document at least three such
occurrences before initiating any action to abate the nuisance. Upon such
documentation, the Code Enforcement Officer may proceed to abate the nuisance
pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, notwithstanding that the
nuisance is not occurring or evident during the abatement process. In such
case, the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine that a reasonable
probability exists that the nuisance will continue to occur periodically if
abatement is not pursued.
   (D)   Voluntary correction; contact. Before taking other steps to abate the
nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer shall make a reasonable attempt to
secure voluntary correction or abatement of the nuisance by:
      (1)   Contacting the responsible person(s), where possible; and
      (2)   Explaining the nuisance.
   (E)   Non-voluntary correction.
      (1)   Enforcement. If the land owner or resident fails to correct or
abate the nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer may still abate the nuisance
using one or more of the procedures set forth in this subchapter, state law or
common law.
      (2)   Civil actions. Either the city or any private person directly
affected by a nuisance may bring a civil action as allowed by law to abate or
enjoin the nuisance, or for damages for causing or maintaining the nuisance
(including the cost, if any, of cleaning the subject property).
      (3)   Criminal actions. Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal
citation from the Code Enforcement Officer, Police Department or by long-form
information.
         (a)   Any responsible person who maintains or assists in maintaining a
nuisance is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
         (b)   If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of
city code (other than this subchapter) or state law, the responsible person may
be charged under the specific provision of city code or state law, even if the
Code Enforcement Officer did not first attempt to obtain voluntary correction
as provided in division (D) above.
         (c)   Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes or interferes with
the city or its agents, or with the responsible person, in the performance of
duties imposed by this subchapter is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.
      (4)   Abatement by eviction. Whenever there is reason to believe that a
nuisance is kept, maintained, or exists in the city, the City Attorney or any
citizen(s) residing in the city, or any person or entity doing business in the
city, in his, her or their own names, may maintain an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance and obtain an order for the
automatic eviction of the tenant of the property harboring the nuisance. The
eviction shall take place as specified in state law.
      (5)   Lien for costs. If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related
to nuisance abatement when due, the city may record a lien on the property or
premises of the full amount of the unpaid fines and costs.
      (6)   Non-exclusive remedies. The city may take any or all of the above-
mentioned remedies (administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/
or to punish any person or entity that creates, causes or allows, a nuisance to
exist. The abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the city or
any person to recover damages or penalties for its past existence.

and evidence exist to initiate a license enforcement action. The Community and
Economic Development Department or City Attorney may request city staff to
investigate further or obtain additional evidence before making a
determination.

Enforcement Hearing Board. Thirty days’ written notice must be provided to the
applicant or licensee. Notice may be served personally or by registered letter,
return receipt requested, at the licensed premises. Receipt by any adult
employee of the business constitutes an adequate service. The notice must

description of the potential penalties; the date, time and place the hearing

grounds for enforcement have been proven. A finding by at least two Board
members is sufficient to sustain a determination. The Board may request that
counsel for either party draft the findings of fact.
      (5)   If the Board determines that there is not sufficient evidence to
provide the alleged grounds for enforcement, then the matter will be dismissed.
      (6)   If the Board determines that sufficient evidence exists to prove
the grounds for enforcement, then it must determine the appropriate penalty
based on the penalty specified in §
111.999 of this chapter. The Board must issue a written order, which may be
drafted by counsel for either party, referencing its finding of facts, and
stating the penalty imposed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 115.001 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent, nor effect, of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution
of obscene material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Brigham City
Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap’s A.M. v. City of
Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.

entitled “Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual
Violence”, by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for
Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from “Sexually-oriented
Businesses: An Insider’s View”, by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan
House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, 1-12-2000, and the Report of
the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually-Oriented
Businesses (6-6-1989, State of Minnesota), the City Council finds the
following.
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed
operators of the establishments, if any. Further, there is presently no
mechanism in the city to make the owners and operators of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of unregulated sexually-oriented businesses
defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at unregulated sexually- oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live
sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses or for the purpose of purchasing
or selling illicit drugs.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually- oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and
chancroid.
      (7)   According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an
estimated 650,000 to 900,000 Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new
HIV infections occurring each year is now about 41,000. Men and women of all
races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
      (8)   Relevant statistics revealed that a total of 1,893 AIDS cases had
been reported in Utah through June 2000.
      (9)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as
many as one in three people with HIV do not know they are infected.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of 10-22-
1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
See, e.g., Findings of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually- oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films.
      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(15) above raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore non-existent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually-oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the
further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity, child
pornography and to minors, materials harmful to them.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of
a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   The barring of such individuals from employment in sexually-
oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent
distribution of illegal material, to prevent conduct which leads to the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to preclude the establishment
of criminal enterprises within the city.
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

effect on the revocation of the license.
   (D)   For the purposes of this section, and for this entire chapter, an act
by any employee that constitutes grounds for revocation of that employee’s
license shall also be imputed to the sexually- oriented business for purposes
of revocation proceedings if the Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance
of evidence that an officer, director or general partner, or an employee who
managed, supervised or controlled, or participated directly in decisions
relating to management or control of the operation of the business, knowingly
or recklessly allowed such act to occur on the premises.
   (E)   (1)   When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in §

Community Development Department within the time stated in division (A)(1)
above, or if after a hearing, the Hearing Officer concludes that grounds as
specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension or revocation of the

days after the Hearing Officer sends, by certified mail, written notice to the
respondent that the license has been denied, suspended or revoked. Such notice
shall include a statement advising the respondent of the right to appeal such
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Hearing Officer finds
that no grounds exist for denial, suspension or revocation of a license, then
within five days after the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall immediately
withdraw the intent to deny, suspend or revoke the license and shall notify the
respondent in writing by certified mail of such action. The Community
Development Department shall contemporaneously therewith issue the license to
the applicant.
   (B)   An applicant or licensee (aggrieved party) whose application for a

intent of the city to protect the public health and safety by requiring that
all swimming pools in the city, insofar as possible, shall meet proper minimum
standards of safety and sanitation designed and adapted to minimize the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   Findings regarding rights-of-way. The city finds that the rights-of-
way within the city:
      (1)   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the city;
      (2)   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      (3)   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-
being of the city and its citizens; and
      (4)   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities’ construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Findings regarding compensation. The city finds that the right to
occupy portions of the rights-of-way for limited times for the business of
providing telecommunications services is a valuable use of a unique public
resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the city
and its taxpayers and, therefore, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair
and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
   (C)   Findings regarding local concern. The city finds that while
telecommunication systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
   (D)   Findings regarding promotion of telecommunications services. The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination
basis, responsive to community and public interest and to assure availability
for municipal, educational and community services.
   (E)   Findings regarding franchise standards. The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
      (1)   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and non- discriminatory basis as provided herein;
      (2)   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
      (3)   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
      (4)   Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority
of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
      (5)   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the city infrastructure;
      (6)   Protects the public’s investment in improvements in the rights-of-
way;
      (7)   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) (Pub. Law No. 104-
104); and
      (8)   Complies with U.C.A. §§ 10-1-401 et seq. and U.C.A. § 72-7-102(4).
   (F)   Power to manage rights-of-way. The city adopts this subchapter
pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the
Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable
compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth
by § 253 of the Act.

digital or analog, voice, data and video imaging and other enhanced
telecommunications services. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS or SYSTEMS also
includes an open video system.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE(S) or SERVICES. Any telecommunications service
provided by a provider within the city that the provider is authorized to
provide under federal, state and local law, and any equipment and/or facilities
required for and integrated with the services provided within the city, except
that these terms do not include “cable service”, as defined in the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (47 U.S.C. §§ 521 et seq.), and the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, being Pub. L. No. 104-104, or its successor
statutes. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM or SYSTEMS also includes an open video
system.
   WIRE. Fiber optic telecommunications cable, wire, coaxial cable or other
transmission medium that may be used in lieu thereof for similar purposes.
(Prior Code, § 33.01.040) (Ord. 98-37, passed 8-20-1998)
§ 152.005 FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Non-exclusive franchise. The city is empowered and authorized to issue
non-exclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, operation,
use and maintenance of systems in the city’s rights-of-way, in accordance with
the provisions of this subchapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider.
   (B)   Every provider must obtain. Except to the extent exempted by federal
or state law, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a
telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services, and every
provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or
providing open video services via an open video system and shall be subject to
the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable
television companies. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may
be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise
for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator
of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and should it intend to
provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a
telecommunications franchise.
   (C)   Nature of grant. A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited
period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the city’s property. This section shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
   (D)   Current providers.
      (1)   Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider
acting without a franchise on the effective date of this subchapter shall
request issuance of a franchise from the city within 90 days of the effective
date of this subchapter.
      (2)   If such request is made, the provider may continue providing
service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or
if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply
with the provisions of §
152.009 of this chapter.
   (E)   Nature of franchise. The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this subchapter shall be a non-exclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, operate, repair, maintain, remove and replace its
system on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services, in
compliance with all other applicable laws and ordinances.
   (F)   Regulatory approval needed. Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   (G)   Term. No franchise issued pursuant to this subchapter shall have a
term of less than five years or greater than 15 years. Each franchise shall be
granted in a nondiscriminatory manner.
(Prior Code, § 33.01.050) (Ord. 98-37, passed 8-20-1998)
§ 152.006 COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS.
   As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to
this subchapter, a provider shall have the following obligations.
   (A)   Application fee. In order to offset the cost to the city to review an
application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, $500 as
a non-refundable application fee. An application fee shall also be paid when an
amendment to an application is filed with the city.
   (B)   Excavation permits. The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in §
153.049 of this code of ordinances.
   (C)   Right-of-way fees. The right-of-way fee, if any, shall be set forth in
the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a right-of-way fee shall
commence on the completion date.
   (D)   Timing. Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
right-of-way fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within 45 days of the close
of each calendar month.
   (E)   Fee statement and certification. Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy.
   (F)   Future costs. A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and expenses
that the city incurs for the services of third parties (including but not
limited to attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or
provider-initiated re-negotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of
this subchapter or a franchise; provided, however, that, the parties shall
agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. Any costs
associated with any work to be done by the Power and Public Works Department to
provide space on city-owned poles shall be borne by the provider.
   (G)   Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider’s use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
subchapter.
   (H)   Interest on late payments. In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
   (I)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
   (J)   Not in lieu of other taxes or fees. The fee payment is not a payment
in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in
this subchapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city-owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   (K)   Continuing obligation and holdover. In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
subchapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation
and other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation;
provided that, any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
   (L)   Costs of publication. A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law.

city for provider’s intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights-of-way during
the franchise term proposed by the provider;
      (3)   Provider’s agreements to comply with the requirements of this
subchapter; and
      (4)   Prior to making any attachments to poles, the willingness to enter
into a pole attachment agreement with the city.
   (C)   Franchise determination. The city, in its discretion, shall determine
the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations
relevant to the use of the rights-of-way, without competitive bidding.
(Prior Code, § 33.01.070) (Ord. 98-37, passed 8-20-1998)
§ 152.008 CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General requirements. No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing
construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any
other requirements or procedures specified by the city or the franchise,
including requirements regarding co-location and cost sharing. A provider shall
obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to the excavation ordinance, before
commencing any work in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Quality. All work involved in the construction, operation,
maintenance, repair, upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a
safe, thorough and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality.
If, at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted
authority by federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part
of the system, including, without limitation, any means used to distribute
signals over or within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or
welfare, or quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its
own cost and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   (C)   Licenses and permits.
      (1)   A provider shall have the sole responsibility for diligently
obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or other forms of
approval or authorization necessary to construct, operate, maintain, upgrade or
repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary approvals from
persons and/or the city to use private property, easements, poles and conduits.
      (2)   A provider shall obtain any required permit, license, approval or
authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits, pole
attachment agreements and the like, prior to the commencement of the activity
for which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.

§ 152.009 RELOCATION OF THE SYSTEM.
   (A)   New grades or lines. If the grades or lines of any rights-of-way are
changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall

   (B)   City authority to move system. The city may, at any time, in case of
fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the city in its reasonable
discretion, cut or move any parts of the system and appurtenances on, over or
under the rights-of-way of the city, in which event the city shall not be
liable therefor to a provider. The city shall notify a provider in writing

prior reasonable written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to
move any structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the
circumstances, temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of
said structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other
than the city for any such movement of its systems.
   (D)   Rights-of-way change; obligation to move system. When the city is
changing a right-of-way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the right-of-way, without cost to the city, to
the extent provided in §§
153.045 through
153.061 of this chapter. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has
obtained an excavation permit.
   (E)   Protect structures. In connection with the construction, operation,
maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its
own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the
city. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the city to alter
any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or any other
municipal structure on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city required
because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be made by the
city or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it shall
be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair and restore
to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the city,
any municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of the city involved in the
construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system
that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on
behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   (F)   No obstruction. In connection with the construction, operation,
maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not
unreasonably obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guide way systems, railways,
passenger travel or other traffic to, from or within the city without the prior
consent of the appropriate authorities.
   (G)   Safety precautions. A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,

other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local requirements including, but not
limited to, the National Electric Safety Code.

the sole determination of the city, an eminent danger exists, any rights-of-way
within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
operation, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be
repaired by the provider of its system may be repaired by the city at the
provider’s expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing before such work
was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a provider an
itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the rights-of-way
intruded upon. The provider shall, within 30 days after receipt of the
statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof.

assignment, sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or
involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, such that it
or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek the approval of the PSC,
the provider or its successor entity shall promptly notify the city of the
nature of the transaction and, if applicable, request a transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity.
         (b)   A request for a transfer shall include a certification that the
successor entity unequivocally agrees to all of the terms of the original
provider’s franchise agreement.
      (2)   Transfer of franchise. Upon receipt of a request to transfer a
franchise, the city designee, as provided in §
152.014(A)(1) of this chapter, may send notice approving the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. Such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the city has reason to believe that the successor entity may not
comply with this subchapter or the franchise agreement, it may require an
application for the transfer. The application shall comply with §
152.005 of this chapter.
   (B)   If PSC approval is no longer required. If the PSC no longer exists, or
if its regulations or state law no longer require approval of transactions

§ 152.013 OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (A)   Insurance, indemnity and security. Prior to the execution of a
franchise, a provider will deposit with the city an irrevocable, unconditional

franchise. A provider shall also indemnify the city as set forth in the
franchise.
   (B)   Oversight. The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and

prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
   (C)   Maintain records. A provider shall at all times maintain:

city’s existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the
types of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights-of-way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights-of-
way where work will be undertaken. As used herein, AS-BUILT MAPS include file
construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. As-built maps, including the
compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be submitted within 30
days of completion of work or within 30 days after completion of modification
and repairs. As-built maps are not required of the provider who is the
incumbent local exchange carrier for the existing system to the extent they do
not exist.
      (2)   Throughout the term, a provider shall maintain complete and
accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership and operations
of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows the city at
all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the franchise.
      (3)   Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the state and generally accepted accounting principles
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section.
   (D)   Confidentiality. If the information required to be submitted is
proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by federal, state or local
law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be treated as a
protected record within the meaning of the state’s Government Records Access
and Management Act (“GRAMA”), being Title 63G, Chapter 2, Part 1, or its
successor statute, making it available only to those who must have access to
perform their duties on behalf of the city; provided that, a provider notifies
the city of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems to be
confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling shall be
the sole responsibility of the provider.
   (E)   Provider’s expense. All reports and records required under this
subchapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter or a franchise.

§ 152.014 RIGHTS OF CITY.
   (A)   Enforcement and remedies.
      (1)   Enforcement; city designee. The city is responsible for enforcing
and administering this subchapter, and the city or its designee, as appointed
by the Mayor, is authorized to give any notice required by law or under any
franchise agreement.
      (2)   Enforcement provision. Any franchise granted pursuant to this
subchapter shall contain appropriate provisions for enforcement, compensation
and protection of the public, consistent with the other provisions of this
subchapter, including, but not limited to, defining events of default,
procedures for accessing the Bond/Security Fund and rights of termination or
revocation.
   (B)   Force majeure. In the event a provider’s performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by this subchapter or a franchise is
prevented by a cause or event not within a provider’s control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events
not within the control of a provider shall include, without limitation, acts of
God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, failure or loss of
utilities, explosions, acts of public enemies and natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes, landslides and fired.

      (1)   Continuation after expiration. Upon either expiration or revocation
of a franchise granted pursuant to this subchapter, the city shall have
discretion to permit or require a provider to continue to operate its system or
provide services for an extended period of time not to exceed six months from
the date of such expiration or revocation. A provider shall continue to operate
its system under the terms and conditions of this subchapter and the franchise
granted pursuant to this subchapter.
      (2)   Continuation by incumbent local exchange carrier. If the provider
is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall be permitted to continue to
operate its system and provide services without regard to revocation or
expiration, but shall be obligated to negotiate a renewal in good faith.
   (D)   Removal or abandonment of franchise property.
      (1)   Abandoned system. In the event that the use of any portion of the
system is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, and 30 days after
no response to written notice from the city to the last known address of
provider; any system has been installed in the rights-of-way without complying
with the requirements of this subchapter or franchise; or the provisions of §
152.005 of this chapter are applicable and no franchise is granted, a provider,
except the provider who is an incumbent local exchange carrier, shall be deemed
to have abandoned such system.
      (2)   Removal of abandoned system. The city, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this subchapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time
the abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards,
any affected rights-of-way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights-of-way in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles, or attachments. The City shall have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the rights-of-way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to
and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
subchapter and any security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full
force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by a
provider with the terms and conditions of this section.
      (3)   Transfer of abandoned system to city. Upon abandonment of any
system in place, a provider, if required by the city, shall submit to the city
a written instrument, satisfactory in form to the city, transferring to the
city the ownership of the abandoned system.
      (4)   Removal of above ground system. At the expiration of the term for
which a franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as
provided for by this subchapter, in any such case without renewal, extension or
transfer, the city shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all above-ground portions of a system from the rights-of-way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180 days. If the
provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall not be required to
remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good faith.
      (5)   Leaving underground system. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this subchapter, a provider may abandon any underground
system in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the
rights-of-way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or
other person. A provider shall not damage a system or otherwise make or render
the system unusable by the city or any other provider prior to abandoning the
system.

(Prior Code, § 33.01.150) (Ord. 98-37, passed 8-20-1998)
§ 152.016 CONFLICTS; SEVERABILITY; NEW DEVELOPMENTS; NOTICES.
   (A)   Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this
subchapter and a franchise entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this
subchapter shall control.
   (B)   Severability. If any provision of this subchapter is held by any
federal, state or local court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as
conflicting with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a court to be
modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and
all appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the subchapter provisions
in question are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate,
distinct and independent part of this subchapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the
event that such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise
changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law the provision in question shall return to full
force and effect and shall again be binding on the city and the provider;
provided that, the city shall give the provider 30 days, or a longer period of
time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a
rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance
with such provision.
   (C)   New developments. It shall be the policy of the city to liberally
amend this subchapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable
the provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of

      (2)   Any accident, damage, death or injury to any of a permittee’s
contractors or subcontractors, or any officers, agents or employees of either
of them, while engaged in the performance of the construction, installation or
maintenance of any small wireless facility, utility pole or wireless support
structure authorized by a small wireless facility permit, or while in or about

misconduct of the city. Each permittee acknowledges and agrees that it has an
immediate and independent obligation to defend the city from any claims that

allegations are or may be groundless, false or fraudulent, which obligation
arises at the time such claim is tendered to the permittee or its agent by the
city and always continues thereafter. Each permittee further agrees that the
city shall have a cause of action for indemnity against the permittee for any
costs the city may be required to pay as a result of defending or satisfying
any claims that arise from or in connection with a small wireless facility

subchapter to the extent that such requirements:
      (1)   Do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally
equivalent services; and

§ 153.006 ADOPTION OF PUBLIC WORKS STANDARDS.
   (A)   There is hereby adopted by the City Council that certain manual
entitled Brigham City Public Works Standards, most current edition, containing
certain minimum standards for the construction of streets, culinary water
lines, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, street intersections, street designs,
details for construction of curb and gutter, sidewalks, driveways from public
streets, details for private connections to public sewer and water systems and
related matters, not less than one copy of which have been and are now filed in
the office of the City Recorder. Any amendments, modifications, supplements or
later editions of said manual shall constitute the manual then in effect under
this subchapter; provided, however, that, before any later editions shall take
effect, the City Council, by resolution, shall certify that the later editions
are available and one copy of all amendments, modifications, supplements or
later editions shall be filed for examination and use by the public in the
office of the City Recorder.
   (B)   Whenever, in the opinion of the city’s Director of Public Works, the
City Engineer or the Supervisor or Manager having jurisdiction, a literal
enforcement of these standards may work an undue hardship or a literal
enforcement may be unnecessary to meet the goals and standards of the city, the
city may modify these standards and specifications. Modifications may be
granted when there are practical difficulties involving carrying out the
provisions of the manual and a panel consisting of the City Engineer, Director
of Public Works and Supervisor or Manager having jurisdiction over that
section, determine that a granting of a modification for an individual case
will meet the goals and requirements of the city without unduly jeopardizing
the public and the individual’s interest. The Supervisor or Manager having
jurisdiction shall first receive an application for modification to the
standards of an interested party. Upon receipt of the application the panel
shall find that a special individual reason makes the strict letter of the
standard and practical, and shall find the modification is in conformance with
the intent and purpose of the standards and shall find that such modification
does not in any way lessen the integrity of the standards. When such findings
of fact are made, the panel may grant such modification as it deems
appropriate. The details of an action granted as modification by this panel
shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Public Works office, with
these specific reasons for the granting of said modification.

STORM DRAIN UTILITY
§ 154.001 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the city and its inhabitants by improving the city’s storm drain system,
managing and controlling storm water runoff, protecting property, preventing
polluted waters from entering the city’s water supply and other receiving
waters, and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the
construction, operation and maintenance of the storm drain system.
(Prior Code, § 24.05.020) (Ord. 00-22, passed 6-1-2000; Ord. 1-16-2025)
§ 154.002 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter and all other ordinances relating to storm
water, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). Management procedures, schedules of
activities, prohibited practices, maintenance procedures, treatment
requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff,
spills or leaks, sludge, water disposal or drainage from raw material storage.
   CATCH BASIN. An inlet into the storm water system designed to keep out large
or obstructive matter.
   CITY or MUNICIPALITY. Brigham City, Utah. The CITY may also be referred to
as a MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4).
   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT. One plan for development or sale, separate parts
of which are related by any announcement, piece of documentation (including a
sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, drawing, plat,
blueprint, contract, permit application, zoning request, computer design and
the like), physical demarcation (including contracts) that identify the scope
of the project, regardless of phasing, combination with other construction
activities or implementation by different owners or operators and may be
commercial, industrial or residential in nature.
   DEBRIS. Any pollutant, dirt, rock, sand, tree, rubbish, litter or any other
item or combination of items.
   DETENTION BASIN. A water storage pond designed to store a volume of water
that reduces the post-development peak runoff of a storm to the pre-development
runoff rate or other rate, as defined by the city. This is accomplished by the
use of an outlet which controls the rate of flow out of the pond into the
receiving storm drain or water body. DETENTION PONDS contain an inlet, outlet
and spillway; the inlet and outlet may be the same. The DETENTION BASIN is
intended to drain the storm water within a period of time to make the volume
available for the next storm event.
   DEVELOPED PARCEL. Any parcel of real property that has been altered from its
natural condition by grading, filling or the construction of improvements or
other impervious surfaces.
   DEVELOPMENT or LAND DEVELOPMENT. Any change to improved or unimproved real
property, including, but not limited to, site preparation, filling, grading,
paving, excavation and construction of buildings or other structures.
   DIRECTOR. The Director of Public Works of the city or his or her duly
authorized representative.

reach such ground water source.
   EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNIT (ESU). The average amount of impervious surface,
expressed in square feet, on developed single-family residential parcels.
   HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. Any material, including any substance, waste or
combination thereof, which because of its quantity, concentration, physical,
chemical or infections characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute
to a substantial presence or potential hazard to human health, safety, property
or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of or
otherwise managed. HAZARDOUS MATERIAL includes, but is not limited to, any
hazardous substance designated under 40 C.F.R. part 116, pursuant to §
   ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.
      (1)   Any drain or conveyance whether on the surface or subsurface, which
allows an illicit discharge to enter the storm drain system, including, but not
limited to, any conveyances which allow any non-storm water discharge,

prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil or that causes water
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rate of flow than
the natural surface.
   LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID). An approach to land development (or re-
development) that works with nature to more closely mimic pre-development
hydrologic functions. LID employs principles such as preserving and recreating
natural landscape features, minimizing effective imperviousness to create
functional and appealing site drainage that treat storm water as a resource
rather than a waste product. There are many practices that have been used to
adhere to these principles such as bioretention facilities, rain gardens,
vegetated rooftops, rain barrels and permeable pavements.
   MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4). A conveyance or system of
conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch
basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, human-made channels or storm drains).
   NON-STORM WATER RUNOFF. Any runoff other than storm water.
   PARCEL. The smallest separately segregated unit or plot of real property
having an identified owner, boundaries and surface area which is documented for
tax purposes and given a property tax or lot number by the County Assessor.

resonates); and noxious or offensive matter of any kind.
   REDEVELOPMENT. The addition, replacement or improvement of impervious
surfaces on a developed site.
   RETENTION BASIN. A water storage pond designed to store the runoff volume of
a storm and dispose of water through percolation, infiltration and evaporation
within a period of time to make the volume available for the next storm event.
A RETENTION BASIN contains an inlet and spillway, but no structure outlet.
   SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW (SSO). A discharge of untreated sanitary wastewater.
   SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. A residential building having only one living
unit, or a residential building having more than one living unit, if living
units are separately owned and titled.
   STORM DRAIN. A closed conduit for conducting storm water that has been
collected by inlets or collected by other means.
   STORM WATER. Any flow that occurs during or following any form of natural
precipitation. STORM WATER includes only the portion of the flow that is
composed of precipitation.

captured at a site which eventually enters into the storm water system and
natural water bodies such as rivers, streams and lakes.
   SUMP. A formalized structure underground, surrounded by drain rock, that
acts as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the
surrounding sub-soil. SUMPS usually receive storm water runoff from paved areas
such as streets, parking lots, building roofs and the like.
   UPDES. Utah Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. All definitions found in
the general permit for discharges from small municipal separate storm sewer
systems (MS4s), not included in the above, are hereby incorporated by
reference.

a base rate of one ESU. All other developed parcels, including multiple-family
residential parcels, shall be charged a fee based on the number of ESUs on the
parcel. If there is more than one city utility bill for the parcel, the fee
shall be divided between the city utility bills covering the parcel. The actual
monthly fee (service charge) shall be computed by multiplying the total ESUs
for the parcel by the monthly rate.
   (D)   Charge per ESU. The amount charged for each ESU shall be established
by resolution of the City Council.
   (E)   Exemptions and credits. The Storm Drain Credit Review Committee may
establish exemptions and credits to the storm drain utility fee. Exemptions set
forth by City Res. 98-20 include the following.
      (1)   Undeveloped parcels. Undeveloped parcels shall not pay any storm
water drainage utility fees.
      (2)   Streets. All streets (publicly and privately owned) are part of the
storm utility conveyance system and are therefore exempt from the storm drain
fee. For the purpose of this section, STREETS shall include the following:
         (a)   Any publicly-owned rights-of-way;
         (b)   Any property that has been dedicated, deeded or condemned as a
street and accepted by the city as a street;
         (c)   Any property that has been abandoned to the public as a street,
if the city considers the property a street and maintains it as such;
         (d)   Any thoroughfares (publicly or privately owned) that are open to
the public, provide access to real property and are used primarily for

the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the
city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services provided to
the property. All properties shall be charged the fee, regardless of whether or
not the owner or occupant of the property requests the Storm Drain Utility
services.
      (2)   Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in
termination of other utility services. The Storm Drain Utility fee shall, from
time to time, be set by resolution.
   (B)   Non-single-family residential parcels will be assessed a fee based on
the actual amount of impervious surface on the parcel. Single-family
residential parcels will all be assessed a common fee, based on the average
amount of impervious surface area found on single-family residential parcels in
the city. The City Council finds that the common fee for single-family
residential parcels is justified because of the following:
      (1)   Each single-family residential parcel contributes approximately the
same amount of storm water runoff; and
      (2)   It would be impractical and difficult to administer the utility if
each single-family residential parcel were measured individually.
   (C)   (1)   The City Council finds ESUs to be of the most accurate
measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to,
benefits from, and otherwise uses the Storm Drain Utility.
      (2)   The City Council establishes the amount of impervious surface
included in each ESU to be equal to the average amount of impervious surface
found on single-family residential parcels. Therefore, each single-family
residential parcel will pay the fee for one ESU.

effectiveness of the measures and controls described in the original plan, the
permittee shall redline the storm water pollution prevention plan, as set forth
below.
(Prior Code, § 24.07.020)
      (9)   Attachments.
         (a)   1.   For sites:
               a.   With a disturbance area between 5,000 square feet and
43,560 square feet (one acre) and not considered a common plan of development;
and
               b.   Located within a special concern area (as determined by the
city) with any amount of disturbance, an erosion control plan shall be
required.
            2.   The erosion control plan shall identify:
               a.   The general topographic features of the site;
               b.   The direction of existing storm water flows from the site;
               c.   Proposed improvements to the site;
               d.   Locations of best management practices to control quantity
and quality of storm water leaving the site during disturbance, including
restoration; and
               e.   Sequencing plan or narrative.
         (b)   A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), including a
state-issued notice of intent, shall be required for all sites disturbing one
acre or greater and that are less than one acre that are part of a common plan
of development. The SWPPP shall contain, but not be limited to, the following
information: (For complete requirements, see the general permit for
construction activities, UTR300000 which can be found on the state’s Department
of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality, website.)
            1.   A site description (including a map with spot elevations and
contour lines) which includes a description of the nature and location of the
construction activity, a description of the intended sequence of major
activities which will disturb soils for major portions of the site (e.g.,
grubbing, excavation, grading, utilities and infrastructure installation and
the like), and estimates of the total area of the site and the total area of
the site that is expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading or other
activities; and
            2.   A description of the proposed measures and controls that will
be implemented during construction activity and/or while the site is not
stable. The plan must clearly describe the times during the construction
process that the measures will be implemented for each major activity
identified pursuant to division (C)(2)(a) above. The plan shall also state the
name and phone number of the person or entity responsible for implementation of
each control measure.
         (c)   The proposed measures and controls described in the plan shall
be designed to meet the following goals and criteria.
            1.   The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to
prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the discharge of
sediment, debris and other construction-related pollutants from the
construction site by storm water runoff into the storm drainage system.
            2.   The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to
prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the deposit, discharge,
tracking by construction vehicles, or dropping of mud, sediment, debris or
other potential pollutants onto public streets and rights-of-way. Any such
discharge shall be cleaned up and removed immediately upon notification to the
permittee or when it otherwise comes to the attention of the permittee. at a
minimum, the deposit or discharge shall be cleaned and removed at the end of
the work shift in which the deposit occurred, or at the end of the workday,
whichever comes first.
            3.   The proposed measures and controls shall consist of best
management practices (BMPs) available at the time that the plan is submitted.
BMPs may include, but shall not be limited to, temporary silt or sediment
fences, sediment traps and detention ponds, gravel construction entrances and
wash down pads to reduce or eliminate off-site tracking, straw bale sediment
barriers, establishment of temporary grasses and permanent vegetative cover,
use of straw mulch as a temporary ground cover, erosion control blankets,
temporary interceptor dikes and swales, storm drain inlet protection, check
dams, pipe slope drains, rock outlet protection, reinforced soil retaining
systems and gabions.
            4.   The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to
preserve existing vegetation, where possible. Disturbed portions of the site
shall be stabilized. Stabilization practices may include temporary seeding,
permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation and other
appropriate measures. Use of impervious surfaces for stabilization should be
avoided. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in
disturbed portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily
or permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after the construction
activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased,
except under the following circumstances:
               a.   If the initiation of stabilization measures by the
fourteenth day after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceases is
precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures
shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
               b.   If construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing will resume within 21 days, temporary
stabilization measures need not be initiated on that portion of the site.
            5.   The proposed measures and controls shall be employed to
minimize the risk of discharge of construction-related pollutants (such as
paint, thinners, solvents and other chemicals) from the construction site. Such
measures may include implementation of storage practices to minimize exposure
of the material to storm water as well as spill prevention and response.
         (d)   PLAN shall be defined as the erosion control plan or storm water
pollution prevention plan, as applicable.

ATYPICAL SUBDIVISION STREETS AND LOT CONFIGURATIONS
§ 155.160 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter provides standards for individual atypical subdivision
street designs and lot configurations. These atypical street designs and lot
configurations shall only be allowed by the Land Use Authority, as applicable,
when the more accepted and standard street designs and lot configurations are

§ 155.161 CONNECTIVITY; APPLICABLE GENERAL PLAN POLICY.
   (A)   Consistent with the policies of the city’s General Plan, as adopted,
the city has a clear priority that all new roads, streets and other rights-of-
way provide connections to either existing or proposed roads, streets and other
rights-of-way. These connections should include active transportation
(pedestrian and bicycling) and vehicle movements.
   (B)   Undeniable support for the requirement that all roads, streets and
other rights-of-way be connected is found in the General Plan goal and strategy
statements. For example: “City fathers (leaders) allowed for the layout of a
highly connected city street system that serves to enhance the efficiency and
livability of the city’s transportation network.
   (C)   A well-planned grid system of roads offers a community multiple routes
for arriving at a destination and allows users of all modes (driving, biking,
walking) more direct travel routes. Good connectivity also serves to disperse
traffic.
   (D)   During the (General Plan) process, many citizens voiced their
appreciation and preference for well-connected roads. They expressed their
desire to institute policies that would increase connectivity in areas where it
is lacking, as well as policies that require future development to conform to
connected grid-like patterns” (General Plan, 2017, pp. 50-51).
(Prior Code, § 25.08.020) (Ord. 20-03, passed 3-19-2020)
§ 155.162 ROAD, STREET AND RIGHT-OF-WAY CONNECTIVITY REQUIRED; LIMITED
EXCEPTION.
   (A)   (1)   All new roads, streets or other rights-of-way, whether proposed
to be dedicated to the city or to remain private, shall provide connections to
the city’s existing road, street and right-of-way network and be found to be
consistent with the city’s General Plan, including its plans, goals and
strategies.
      (2)   Any cul-de-sac, whether proposed to be dedicated for public use or
to be private shall be prohibited after the effective date of this chapter
unless allowed by division (B) below.
      (3)   Stub streets are required and allowed, considering:
         (a)   To implement the road, street and right-of-way connectivity
policies of the General Plan, and when future property and subdivision
connections are required, or desired, stub streets may be required; and
         (b)   All stub streets shall meet the design requirements of the
city’s Public Works Standards for Development, Design and Construction, as
adopted.
(Prior Code, § 25.08.030)
   (B)    A cul-de-sac proposed after the effective date of this chapter may be
allowed if the Land Use Authority, as applicable, finds a special or unique
circumstance and compelling evidence to support all the following:
      (1)   No potential exists in the future for any road, street or right-of-
way connection;
      (2)   No goal or strategy of the General Plan will be compromised, nor
any other policy of the city adversely affected;
      (3)   Circumstances exist that benefit the city to not require a future
road, street or right-of-way connection;
      (4)   Notwithstanding the preceding exception standards, non-motorized
connections for active transportation and facilities, may be required; and
      (5)    In addition to the findings required by the Land Use Authority, as
provided by this section, no allowed cul-de-sac may exceed the maximum length
or the maximum number of lots or dwelling units, as provided by §§
155.260 through
155.275 of this chapter.

      (1)   The Appeal Authority shall adopt bylaws for the regulation of its
procedure and the conduct of its duties not inconsistent with the provisions of
this chapter or of the Utah Code. Such bylaws, to become effective, shall first
be approved by the City Council.
      (2)   Decisions of the Appeal Authority shall become effective at the
meeting in which the decision is made, unless a different time is designated in
the Appeal Authority’s rules.
   (B)   Powers and duties. The Appeal Authority shall have the following
powers:
      (1)   Appeals. Hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement,
determination or decision of the Land Use Authority and/or Community
Development Staff’s application of the city’s land use ordinances. An appeal
may not be used to waive or modify the terms or requirements of the city’s land
use ordinances;
      (2)   Special exceptions. Hear and decide special exceptions to the terms
of the zoning ordinance where the City Council has granted jurisdiction to the
Appeal Authority to do so. The Appeal Authority may hear and decide special
exceptions only if authorized to do so by the zoning ordinance and based only
upon the standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance;
      (3)   Variances. Hear and decide all applications for variance from the
terms of the zoning ordinance other than allowing a use variance. Such
decisions shall be made in accordance with state law, this section and the
rules adopted by the Appeal Authority; and
      (4)   Non-conforming use. Hear and make determinations regarding the
existence, expansion or modification of non-conforming uses.
   (C)   Community Development staff’s determinations. The Community
Development Staff may decide certain matters as designated by the Appeal
Authority Board, and consistent with guidelines established by this chapter,
the Utah Code and the rules adopted by the Appeal Authority. Pursuant to this
authority, the Community Development Director or designee may decide all cases
which are routine in nature, uncontested, do not impact on the character of the
neighborhood, are primarily brought about by recent changes in the Zoning
Ordinance creating a large number of non-conforming structures or uses, and
which the Appeal Authority has granted on an almost routine basis. The specific
types of decisions the Community Development Director or designee is authorized
to make shall include:
      (1)   Determination of a non-conforming use which can be verified by
substantial evidence. Substantial evidence, for the purpose of this section,
shall mean official documents, including any written correspondence, receipts,
permits or documents issued by a public body or agency thereof and the like
that may establish the truth of the matter asserted by the applicant;
      (2)   Consider additions or alterations to existing buildings and
structures which are non- conforming as to height, area or yard regulations;
provided, the addition follows the existing wall lines and no additional
dwelling units are added to the building or structure;
      (3)   Change in status of a non-conforming use to an equally intensive or
a less intense use than that immediately preceding the proposed use; and
      (4)   Final review and approval on plans where the Appeal Authority has
required that a final plan be submitted for special approval, showing that all
the requirements imposed by the Appeal Authority in granting the original
approval have been complied with. All decisions of the Community Development
Director or designee made under this section may be appealed to the Appeal
Authority.
   (D)   Appeals to the Appeal Authority. Appeals may be made to the Appeal
Authority by the city, the applicant, or any other person or entity adversely
affected by a zoning decision administering or interpreting a zoning ordinance.
All appeals shall be made as follows.
      (1)   The appeal shall be made within 30 days of the action or decision
being appealed from by filing a notice of appeal with the Appeals Authority
with the Community Development Department.
      (2)   The notice of appeal shall specify the grounds for the appeal and
circumstances related thereto. The notice shall allege that there was error in
the order, requirement, decision or determination made by an official or
officials in the administration or interpretation of the zoning ordinance. A
notice failing to allege such error or specifying the grounds for appeal may be
summarily dismissed by the Appeals Authority with or without prejudice.
Response to the above requirements shall be set forth in detail in the notice
of appeal. The person or entity making the appeal shall have the burden of
proving that an error has been made.
      (3)   All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was made shall be transmitted to the Appeals Authority.
      (4)   The Appeals Authority shall set the appeal for hearing to be held
within a reasonable time from the date the appeal is received. Written notice
of the date set for hearing the appeal shall be mailed to the applicant at
least seven days before the appeal hearing date. After hearing the appeal, the
Appeals Authority may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such
order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and, to that
end, shall have all the powers of the officer or body from which the appeal is
made.
      (5)   The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings and actions in
furtherance of the matter appealed, pending a decision of the Appeals
Authority. Said stay shall exist unless the Planning Commission or Community
Development Director or designee certifies to the Appeals Authority, after the
notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, the stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by restraining order which
may be granted by the District Court on application, notice and due cause
shown.
      (6)   The concurring vote of three members of the Appeals Authority shall
be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of
any administrative official, Planning Commission or agency, or to decide in
favor of the appellant.
      (7)   The city, or any person adversely affected by any decision of the
Appeals Authority, may petition the district court for a review of the
decision, provided the petition is filed with the court within 30 days after
the Board’s decision is final. In the petition, the appealing party may only
allege that the Appeals Authority’s decision was arbitrary, capricious or
illegal. The Appeal Authority may, after finding that it is in the best
interest of the city to do so, stay its decision pending district court review.
   (E)   Variances.
      (1)   A variance is a device which grants a property owner relief from
certain provisions of the zoning ordinance when, because of the particular
physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the property,
compliance would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience or a desire to reduce financial
difficulties.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the Appeals Authority
may grant a variance from the requirements of any provision of the zoning
ordinance to the extent that such a grant shall be consistent with the
provisions of this section. Notwithstanding, the spirit of this chapter must be
observed and substantial justice done. Further, a previous variance can never
set a precedent. Each case must be considered only on its individual merits.
The Appeals Authority may grant a variance only if:
         (a)   Literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause an
unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of the zoning ordinance;
         (b)   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zoning district;
         (c)   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zoning
district; and
         (d)   The granting of the variance will not substantially affect the
General Plan and will not be contrary to the public interest; and the spirit of
the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial justice done.
      (3)   In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance
would cause unreasonable hardship under this section, the Appeals Authority may
not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship:
         (a)   Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
         (b)   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
      (4)   In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance
would cause unreasonable hardship under this section, the Appeal Authority may
not find unreasonable hardship if the hardship is self-imposed or economic
      (5)   In determining whether or not there are special circumstances
attached to the property under this section, the Appeal Authority may find that
special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances:
         (a)   Relate to the hardship complained of; and
         (b)   Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties
in the same district.
      (6)   The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the
conditions justifying a variance have been met.
      (7)   Variances, once granted, shall run with the land.
      (8)   Use variances may not be granted by the Appeal Authority, nor by
any other body.
      (9)   In granting a variance, the Appeal Authority may impose additional
requirements on the applicant that will:
         (a)   Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
         (b)   Serve the same or similar purpose of the standard or requirement
that is waived or modified.

MULTIPLE USE, AGRICULTURAL AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
§ 156.085 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Multiple use districts. The purposes of providing a multiple use
district are to establish areas in mountain, hillside, canyon, mountain valley,
desert and other open and generally undeveloped lands where human habitation
would be limited in order to protect land and open space resources; to reduce
unreasonable requirements for public utility and service expenditures through
uneconomic and unwise dispersal and scatteration of population; to encourage
use of the land, where appropriate, for forestry, grazing, agriculture, mining,
wildlife habitat and recreation; to avoid excessive damage to watersheds, water
pollution, soil erosion, danger from brushland fires, damage to grazing,
livestock raising and to wildlife values; and, to promote the health, safety,
convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants of the
community:
      (1)   MU-40 minimum lot size: 40 acres;
      (2)   MU-80 minimum lot size: 80 acres; and
      (3)   MU-160 minimum lot size: 160 acres.
   (B)   Agricultural districts. To promote and preserve in appropriate areas
conditions favorable to agriculture and to maintain greenbelt open spaces.
These districts are intended to include activities normally and necessarily
related to the conduct of agriculture and to protect the district from the
intrusion of uses inimical to the continuance of agricultural activity:
      (1)   A-1 minimum lot size: one acre;
      (2)   A-5 minimum lot size: five acres; and
      (3)   A-20 minimum lot size: 20 acres.
   (C)   Rural residential districts. To promote and preserve in appropriate
areas conditions favorable to large-lot family life, the keeping of limited
numbers of animals and fowl for personal use and home base agricultural
production and reduced requirements for public utilities. These districts are
intended to be primarily residential in character and protected from
encroachment by commercial and industrial uses:
      (1)   RR-1 minimum lot size: one acre; and
      (2)   RR-5 minimum lot size: five acres.
(Prior Code, § 29.11.010) (Ord. 22-16, passed 8-11-2022)
§ 156.086 EXISTING AGRICULTURE PRACTICES AND KEEPING OF ANIMALS AND FOWL.
   Existing agriculture practices and keeping of animals and fowl that existed
lawfully prior to 8-11-2022, which is not allowed under this chapter, may be
continued as a non-conforming use; except that, if the non-conforming use
property is subdivided, the non-conforming use shall then be deemed abandoned
and any future agriculture practices and keeping of animals and fowl shall be
in conformity with this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.11.015) (Ord. 22-16, passed 8-11-2022)
§ 156.087 CODES AND SYMBOLS.
   In following the sections of this chapter, uses of land or buildings which
are allowed in the various districts are shown as “permitted uses”, indicated
by a “P” in the appropriate column, or as “conditional uses”, indicated by a
“C” in the appropriate column. If a use is not allowed in a given district, it
is either not named in the use list or it is indicated in the appropriate
column by an “N”. If a regulation applies in a given district, it is indicated
in the appropriate column by a numeral to show the linear or square feet, or
acres required, or by the letter “A”. If the regulation does not apply, it is
indicated in the appropriate column by a dash, “-”.
(Prior Code, § 29.11.020) (Ord. 22-16, passed 8-11-2022)
§ 156.088 USES.
   (A)   No building, structure or land shall be used, and no building or
structure shall be hereafter erected, structurally altered, enlarged or
maintained in the multiple use, agricultural or rural residential districts,
except as provided in this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   In the absence of a specific approval from the Planning
Commission to the contrary, public service structures shall be subject to yard
area requirements and setbacks.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may allow public service structures to be
located within the required yard areas specified in this subchapter upon the
following findings:
         (a)   The public service structure is needed for the efficient
delivery of public services to the subject property;
         (b)   Location of the public service structure in the required yard
area will be beneficial to the subject property and will not result in undue
public safety, aesthetic or functional impacts on the subject property or
surrounding properties;
         (c)   The public service structure is integrated functionally and
aesthetically into the overall design of the site; and
         (d)   Location of the public service structure outside of the required
yard area would be impossible or impractical due to functional considerations
or because of site specific limitations.

and the like, to a listed use, and when so categorized such use shall
thereafter be recognized and treated the same as a listed use.

§ 156.121 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Protection of single-family residential uses. A six-foot solid fence
or masonry wall shall be provided along the adjoining property line where a
two-family, three-family, four-family, multi-family group or planned unit
development adjoins any single-family residential use. Chain link fencing with
slats is not considered a solid fence for purposes of this section, unless the
chain link has interlocking opaque vinyl, which is pre-inserted into the mesh.
A minimum 20-foot wide planting strip shall be required between the multi-
family dwelling and the property line. When a single-story height multi-family
building adjoins any single-family residential use the planting strip can be
reduced to ten feet after ensuring there is no negative effect on the single-
family residence. Evergreen or deciduous trees shall be planted in the planting
strip to provide a buffer between the two uses. A tree planting plan shall be
submitted to the city for review and approval by the City Forester. The minimum
tree size is two-inch caliper for deciduous trees and an eight-foot height for
evergreens. A fence or wall is not required along the adjoining property line
in the required front yard setback. If a fence or wall is installed along the
property line in the required front yard setback it shall comply with the
height and location standards as referenced in §
156.346 of this chapter.
   (B)   Recreation and playground areas. In any residential development with
four or more dwelling units on a single parcel of land, there shall be provided
usable recreation or playground areas outside of the front yard setback, with a
total minimum area of 2,000 square feet for three dwelling units and 250
additional square feet for each dwelling unit thereafter. The minimum width and
length of any usable recreation or playground area shall not be less than 20
feet unless a trail system is approved as part of the requirement by the
Community Development Manager or designee. The on-site, above grade storm
drainage detention basin may count toward a portion of the recreation area if
the applicant provides sufficient evidence that the basin is safe for
recreational purposes and usable pertaining to the area, slope and landscape.
All recreation and playground areas shall be accessible by all dwelling units
within the development. Pathways within the designated areas may be included in
the calculation (sidewalks which border a parking lot and/or buildings and
parking lots are not considered recreation area for the purposes of this
section).
   (C)   Landscaping. In multiple residential developments (two-family, three-
family, four-family, multiple-family, group or planned unit developments), all
areas not covered by buildings, structures and parking, shall be landscaped and
maintained using an underground automatic irrigation system. Areas not covered
by an approved building, required parking trees or shrubs shall be covered by
grass or another acceptable ground cover such as bark, wood chips or decorative
rocks. Dirt, weeds and similar materials are not considered acceptable ground
cover. Each project shall submit a complete landscaping plan to the city for
review and approval by the City Forester. The landscaping plan shall include at
least one tree per unit or as approved by the City Forester. The minimum tree
size is two-inch caliper for deciduous trees and eight feet in height for
evergreen trees. No species of trees or large shrub should be planted under
overhead lines or over underground utilities if its natural growth may
interfere with the installation or maintenance of any public or private
utility. Storm drainage facilities should be incorporated into the landscape
design and appear to be a part of the overall project.

COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
§ 156.135 PURPOSE.
   (A)   General Commercial (GC) Zone. The purpose of this zone is to establish
a district for a combination of commercial, office, entertainment, retail, and
service businesses and activities. The zone is designed to allow a range of
businesses with access from major streets. This zone is distinguished from the
Central Business District by the accommodation of uses that may generate a
lower level of pedestrian activity. A high level of quality is required in
project design.
   (B)   Central Business District (CDB) Zone. The purpose of this zone is to
establish a district for retail, entertainment, service and heritage related
businesses and activities that are intended to cultivate a high level of
pedestrian activity, and encourage both daytime and nighttime consumer
activity. This zone is also intended to protect the unique nature of the city’s
downtown area. Regulations of this zone are designed to provide a suitable
environment for those commercial and service uses which are vital to economic
life, with an emphasis on retail, service, entertainment and heritage
enterprises. A high degree of quality is required in project design.
Compatibility of new construction with existing architecture is required.

§ 156.139 PROTECTION OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Where a commercial development adjoins any residential zone or
residential use, there shall be provided along the adjoining property line a
six-foot solid fence or masonry wall. Chain link fencing with slats is not
considered a solid fence for purposes of this section. A fence or wall is not
required along the adjoining property line in the required front yard setback.
If a fence or wall is installed along the property line in the required front
yard setback, it shall comply with the height and location standards as
referenced in §
156.346 of this chapter.
   (B)   Where a multiple-family residential development adjoins any single-
family residential use, there shall be provided along the adjoining property
line a six-foot solid fence or masonry wall. Chain link fencing with slats is
not considered a solid fence or wall for purposes of this section, unless the
chain link has interlocking opaque vinyl, which is pre-inserted into the mesh.
A fence or wall is not required along the adjoining property line in the
required front yard setback. If a fence or wall is installed along the property
line in the required front yard setback, it shall comply with the height and
location standards as referenced in §
156.346 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.13.050) (Ord. 09-03, passed 2-19-2009)
§ 156.140 LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Landscaped areas are used to frame and soften structures, to define
site functions, to enhance the quality of the environment and to screen
undesirable views. Landscaping should complement the buildings and surroundings
to make a positive contribution to the aesthetics and function of both the
specific site and the area.
   (B)   The following characteristics will need to be addressed in the design
of each commercial project:
      (1)   (a)   Landscaped areas should generally incorporate planting
utilizing a three tiered system:
            1.   Grasses and ground cover;
            2.   Shrubs and vines; and
            3.   Trees.
         (b)   Landscape design and construction should emphasize drought
tolerant landscaping where possible.
      (2)   All areas not covered by approved buildings and structures or
required parking must be completely landscaped and maintained using an
automatic irrigation system. All areas not covered by an approved building,
required parking, trees or shrubs shall be covered by grass or another
acceptable ground cover such as bark, wood chips or decorative rocks. Dirt,
weeds and similar materials are not considered acceptable ground cover.
      (3)   All required landscaping must be properly maintained.
      (4)   Plant materials will be placed in a manner that avoids interference
with project lighting or restriction of access to emergency apparatus such as
fire hydrants or fire alarm boxes. Landscaping should preserve the clear view
area defined in this chapter.
      (5)   Planting areas will be protected from vehicular and pedestrian
encroachment by raised planting surfaces, bumper guards or the use of curbs.
      (6)   Plants in containers or planter boxes are encouraged for areas
adjacent to store fronts along walkways; provided that, the containers or
planter boxes do not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular circulation.
      (7)   Vines and climbing plants integrated upon buildings, trellises and
perimeter walls are not only attractive, but also help discourage graffiti and
are encouraged in appropriate areas.
      (8)   Existing mature trees, riparian corridors and view sheds should be
preserved and incorporated into the project landscaping.
      (9)   Storm drainage facilities should be incorporated into the landscape
design and appear to be a part of the overall project.
      (10)   No species of trees or large shrub should be planted under
overhead lines or over underground utilities if its natural growth may
interfere with the installation or maintenance of any public or private
utility.
      (11)   A complete landscaping plan is considered part of an application
for site plan review and shall include the types and sizes of all planting
materials. A minimum of one evergreen tree no less than five feet in height or
deciduous tree with no less than two-inch caliper for every 1,000 square feet
of land not covered by an approved building or required parking. Each plan
should include a variety of planting materials and a mixture of evergreen and
deciduous trees.
         (a)   For the purposes of this section, if a fractional number is
obtained in calculating the tree requirement, the fraction will either be
rounded up to a whole number if at point-five (0.5) or greater or disregarded
if at point-four (0.4) or less.
         (b)   1.   The Planning Commission, upon receiving a recommendation by
the City Forester, may approve a modification to the number of required trees
if the property owner seeking development approval presents substantial
evidence demonstrating that the modification, as determined by the Planning
Commission, should be approved based on one of the following reasons:
               a.   The strict application of the number of trees will result
in an unreasonable hardship as the result of shallow lot depth, irregular lot
shape, unusual topography or other similar factors including soil condition,
tree spacing or utility conflict; or
               b.   The proposed modification constitutes an innovative
landscaping design which is superior to the landscaping that would result from
application of required standards.
            2.   If the Planning Commission grants a modification under this
section, it shall make specific findings justifying the modification.
         (c)   Existing trees on the said property m ay count toward the
requirement upon the City Forester’s inspection and approval. Consideration
includes the size, type, location and condition of the tree(s).
      (12)   Refer to 1100 South Corridor Design Guidelines, West Forest Street
Design Guidelines and West Forest Street Corridor Overlay and the Historic
Downtown Design Guidelines for specific landscape requirements.
(Prior Code, § 29.13.060) (Ord. 09-03, passed 2-19-2009)
§ 156.141 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Any area outside of a building used for any activity other than off-
street parking and loading shall be completely enclosed within a solid fence or
wall of a height sufficient to completely screen such activity from the street
or from adjoining parcels (chain link fencing with slats is not considered a
solid fence or wall for purposes of this chapter).
   (B)   All uses shall be conducted from enclosed buildings except automobile
fuel or service stations, carwashes, automobile and recreational vehicle sales,
rental or lease, off-street parking and loading, plant material nurseries,
outdoor restaurants and commercial recreation, unless otherwise permitted by
planned unit development or conditional use permit.
   (C)   All uses shall be free from objectionable noise, hazards or nuisances.
   (D)   Properties located within the 1100 South Corridor, West Forest Street
and Historic Downtown areas of the community are subject to established design
guidelines.
(Prior Code, § 29.13.070) (Ord. 09-03, passed 2-19-2009)
§ 156.142 USES NOT LISTED.
   The Community Development Director or designee shall have the authority to
identify and categorize unlisted uses within the listed permitted or
conditional uses of this chapter, based on a finding of substantial similarity
of character, origin and impact and the like to a listed use and, when so
categorized, such use shall thereafter be recognized and treated the same as a
listed use.

shall be considered the same as a change in the zoning map, and shall be made
in accordance with the provisions for amendments of the zoning ordinance.
   (E)   If no development has occurred to effectuate a P District development
within two years after the district is created, the Planning Commission shall
review the action and determine whether or not the continuation of a given P
District is in the public interest. If the Planning Commission so recommends,
the governing body may order the area reverted to the original district from
which it was created, without a public hearing.
   (F)   At the time of adoption of any ordinance establishing a P District,
the governing body shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to
insure the accomplishment, at the scheduled times, of the public improvements,
public dedications and grants of easement shown on the approved General

SENSITIVE AREAS OVERLAY ZONES
§ 156.230 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for safe, orderly and
beneficial development of property within areas characterized by diversity of
physiographic conditions and shown on the City Zoning Map as “Sensitive Areas
Overlay Zone”; to limit alteration of topography and reduce encroachment upon,
or alteration of, such areas.
   (B)   Physiographic conditions can be considered to include, but are not
limited to, slope of the land, natural drainage ways, wetlands, soil
characteristics, potential landslide areas, faults zones and wildfire hazard
areas.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.010) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.231 REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The type of regulation applicable to the land depends upon the
classification in which the land is placed, as provided in §
156.234 of this chapter.
   (B)   If those regulations conflict with other regulations of the city’s
municipal code, the more stringent of the two regulations shall govern.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.020) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.232 SENSITIVE AREAS OVERLAY MAP.
   (A)   A map showing the sensitive areas overlay which specifies critical
areas within the city which, when proposed for development, must go through the
process outlined in this subchapter.
   (B)   Properties within this overlay may not be suitable for development or
may only be suitable after mitigation of the hazards associated with the
specific site.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.030) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.233 ALL DEVELOPMENTS(S) TO BE CONSIDERED A CONDITIONAL USE IN SENSITIVE
AREAS.
   Because of the environmental conditions existing within sensitive areas, all
developments proposed within an area determined to be a sensitive area shall be
considered a conditional use and shall be reviewed and considered consistent
with the procedures for the review of a conditional use as provided in §§
156.375 through
156.387 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.040) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.234 LAND CLASSIFICATIONS.
   The following factors shall be used to determine the classifications of
various lands and their constraints to building and development on them:
   (A)   Floodplain corridor lands. Lands with potential stream flow and flood
hazard. The following lands are classified as floodplain corridor lands:
      (1)   All land contained within the 100-year floodplain as defined by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, in maps adopted by the city municipal
code;
      (2)   All land within the area defined as floodplain corridor land in
maps adopted by the City Council as provided for in §
156.236 of this chapter;
      (3)   All lands which have physical or historical evidence of flooding in
the historical past; and
      (4)   All areas within 20 feet (horizontal distance) of any creek
designated for riparian preservation in division (B) below and depicted as such
on maps adopted by the Council as provided for in §
156.236 of this chapter.
   (B)   Riparian preservation and wetland areas. The lands shown on the
official maps as riparian areas. These areas are identified as 75 feet from the
stream centerline for streams draining a basin of greater than one square mile,
and 25 feet from a stream that drain areas of one square mile or less. It also
includes any areas identified as wetlands or riparian in a Federal Section 404
Permit Process;

IMAGES/0-0-0-3021.jpg]
   (C)   Erosive and slope failure lands. Lands with potential erosion hazards.
Erosive lands and slope failure lands are lands that are subject to damage from
erosion and slope failure, or defined as erosion and slope failure lands on the
sensitive area overlay map (see §
156.232 of this chapter) and have a slope of 25% or greater;
   (D)   Earthquake fault and hazard lands. Lands with identified earthquake
faults and areas prone associated earthquake hazards such as debris flows,
landslides, liquefaction and rock falls, as defined on the sensitive area
overlay map (see §
156.232 of this chapter);
   (E)   Wildfire hazard lands. Lands with potential of wildfire, as defined on
the sensitive area overlay map (see §
156.232 of this chapter);
   (F)   Sever constraint lands. Lands with severe development limitations
which generally limit normal development. The following lands are classified as
severe constraint lands:
      (1)   All areas which are within the floodway channels; and
      (2)   All lands with a slope greater the 25%.
   (G)   Classifications cumulative. The above classifications are cumulative
in their effect and, if a parcel of land falls under two or more
classifications, it shall be subject to the regulations of each classification.
Those restrictions applied shall pertain only to those portions of the land
being developed and not necessarily to the whole parcel.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.050) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.235 REVIEW OF PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IN SENSITIVE AREAS.
   The Community Development Department, prior to scheduling any application
for a development proposed to be located wholly or partially, within any
sensitive area as identified by this subchapter, shall receive comments and
recommendations from city departments and other reviewing agencies, as
applicable.
(Prior Code, § 29.18.060) (Ord. 07-17, passed 8-30-2007)
§ 156.236 FLOODPLAIN CORRIDOR LANDS.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage.
      (1)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
         (a)   Protect human life and health;
         (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
         (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water

      (2)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its
purposes, this section uses the following methods:
         (a)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety
or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
         (b)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         (c)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;
         (d)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
         (e)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.
      (3)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING. Flooding occurring on the surface of an
alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is
characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment
transport and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
         APEX. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the
flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and
alluvial fan flooding can occur.
         AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a 1% chance or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow.
         AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The
area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After

FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A-1-99, VO, V1-30, VE
or V.
         BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.

the floor of the water; and
               b.   Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base
flood. In the case of Zones A-1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, ELEVATED
BUILDING also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement
of flood waters.

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
         LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that, such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of § 60.3 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001 et seq.
         MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections,

improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. Law No. 97-348)),
being 16 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., includes substantial improvement and means the
date the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual START
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual START
OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
         STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
         SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
            1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
            2.   Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided that, the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
         VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of the
ordinance contained herein when specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship. A VARIANCE, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section. (For full
requirements, see § 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
         VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3),
(e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is
codified in § 60.03 of C.F.R. Title 44, is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
         WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
      (4)   General provisions.
         (a)   Lands to which this section applies. The section shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city.
         (b)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The
areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, “The Flood Insurance
Study” for Brigham City, dated 9-29-2010, with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions
thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
section. The city automatically adopts all effective FEMA Flood Insurance Rate
Studies, and all FEMA effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
         (c)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall
be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this section.
         (d)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this
section and other applicable regulations.
         (e)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not
intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
         (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements; liberally
construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit nor
repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
         (g)   Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood
protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased
by human-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside
the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on
the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
      (5)   Administration.
         (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Mayor’s
appointee is hereby appointed the Floodplain Administrator to administer and
implement the provisions of this section and other appropriate sections of 44
C.F.R. (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain
management.
         (b)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:
            1.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records
pertaining to the provisions of this section;
            2.   Review permit applications to determine whether proposed
building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be
reasonably safe from flooding;
            3.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development
permits required by adoption of this section;
            4.   Review permits for proposed development to assure that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local
governmental agencies (including § 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344) from which prior approval is
required;
            5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation;
            6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the
State Coordinating Agency which is the Utah NFIP Coordinator, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
            7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;
            8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in
accordance herewith, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
division (B)(6) below;
            9.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the
Floodplain Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A-1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community; and
            10.   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones A-1-30, AE, AH, on the community’s FIRM which increases
the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot; provided
that, the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(Conditional Letter of Map Revision).
         (c)   Permit procedures. Application for a development permit shall be
presented to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her and
may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing
the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations,
existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured
homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood
hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:
            1.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
            2.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be flood-proofed;

architect that the non- residential flood proofed structure shall meet the
flood-proofing criteria hereof;
            4.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and
            5.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
division (B)(3) above.
         (d)   Approval or denial of a development permit. Approval or denial
of a development permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all
of the provisions of this section and the following relevant factors:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
            7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
            8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
            10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan for that area.
      (e)   Variance procedures.
            1.   The Appeal Authority as established by the community shall
hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of
this section.
            2.   The Appeal Authority shall hear and render judgment on an
appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision
or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this section.
            3.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal
Authority may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
            4.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
            5.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
            6.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (B)(3)(b) above have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
            7.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent
of this section, the Appeal Authority may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this section.
            8.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
            9.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
            10.   Prerequisites for granting variances.
               a.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
               b.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
                  i.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
                  ii.   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
                  iii.   A determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
               c.   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
            11.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction
and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided that:
               a.   The criteria outlined in divisions (B)(4)(a) through (B)(4)
(i) above are met; and
               b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.
      (6)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
         (a)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements.
            1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
            2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
            3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
            4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
            5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
            6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
            7.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
         (b)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where
base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in divisions (B)(3)
(b), (B)(4)(h) or (B)(5)(c) above, the following provisions are required.
            1.   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this division (B)(6)(b),
as proposed herein, is satisfied.
            2.   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
               a.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this section.
               b.   A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood
proofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
            3.   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements,
with fully-enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum criteria.
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
            4.   Manufactured homes.
               a.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within
Zone A on a community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and
practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces;
               b.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or
substantially improved within Zones A-1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM
on sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision or in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage”
as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement; and
               c.   Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
Zones A-1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions hereof be elevated so that either:
                  i.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above
the base flood elevation; or
                  ii.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength
that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement.
            5.   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles
placed on sites within Zones A-1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM either:
               a.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
               b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
               c.   Meet the permit requirements of division (B)(4)(a) above,
and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” herein. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (c)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
            1.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with divisions (B)
(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4) above.
            2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including
the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet
development permit requirements of divisions (B)(3)(c), (B)(4)(c) and (B)(6)
above.
            3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to divisions (B)
(3)(b) or (B)(4)(b)8. above.
            4.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
            5.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
         (d)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established herein are areas
designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply.
            1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one
foot above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number
is specified).
            2.   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures:
               a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one
foot above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number
is specified); or
               b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy:
                  i.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of
this section, as proposed herein, are satisfied; and
                  ii.   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from
proposed structures.
         (e)   Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood
hazard established in division (B)(3) above are areas designated as floodways.
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply.
            1.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted
regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
            2.   If division (B)(5)(e)1. above is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of this division (B)(6).
            3.   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations; provided that, the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

or preliminary plat of a subdivision, which contains areas designated wildfire
hazard areas.
      (2)   The Community Development Department shall forward the Fire
Prevention and Control Plan to the Director of Emergency Services within three
days of the receipt of a completed application. The Director of Emergency
Services shall review the Fire Prevention and Control Plan, and submit a
written report to the Community Development Department no less than seven days
before the scheduled hearing. The Director of Emergency Services report shall
be a part of the record of the planning action.
      (3)   The Fire Prevention and Control Plan shall include the following
items:
         (a)   An analysis of the wildfire hazards on the site, as influenced
by existing vegetation and topography;
         (b)   A map showing the areas that are to be cleared of dead, dying or
severely diseased vegetation;
         (c)   A map of the areas that are to be thinned to reduce the
interlocking canopy of trees;
         (d)   A tree management plan showing the location of all trees that
are to be preserved and removed on each lot. In the case of heavily forested
parcels, only trees scheduled for removal shall be shown;
         (e)   The areas of primary and secondary fuel breaks that are required
to be installed around each structure, as required by this section; and
         (f)   Roads and driveways sufficient for emergency vehicle access and
fire suppression activities, including the slope of all roads and driveways
within the wildfire lands area.
      (4)   The Land Use Authority shall approve the Fire Prevention and
Control Plan when, in addition to the findings required by this chapter, the
additional finding is made that the wildfire hazards present on the property
have been reduced to a reasonable degree, balanced with the need to preserve
and/or plant a sufficient number of trees and plants for erosion prevention,
wildlife habitat and aesthetics.
      (5)   The Land Use Authority may require, through the imposition of
conditions attached to the approval, the following requirements as deemed
appropriate for the development of the property:
         (a)   Delineation of areas of heavy vegetation to be thinned and a
formal plan for such thinning;
         (b)   Clearing of sufficient vegetation to reduce fuel load;
         (c)   Removal of all dead and dying trees; and
         (d)   Relocation of structures and roads to reduce the risks of
wildfire and improve the chances of successful fire suppression.
      (6)   (a)   The Fire Prevention and Control Plan shall be implemented
during the public improvements required of a subdivision or planned unit
development, and shall be considered part of the subdivider’s obligations for
land development. The plan shall be implemented prior to the issuance of any
building permit for structures to be located on lots created by partitions and
for subdivisions or planned unit development not requiring public improvements.
         (b)   The Director of Emergency Services, or designee, shall inspect
and approve the implementation of the Fire Prevention and Control Plan, and the
plan shall not be considered fully implemented until the Director of Emergency
Services has given written notice to the Community Development Department that
the plan was completed as approved by the Land Use Authority.
      (7)   In subdivisions or planned unit developments, provisions for the
maintenance of the Fire Prevention and Control Plan shall be included in the
covenants, conditions and restrictions for the development, and the city shall
be named as a beneficiary of such covenants, conditions and restrictions.
   (B)   Requirements for construction of all structures.
      (1)   All new construction and any construction expanding the size of an
existing structure, shall have a “fuel break”, as defined below.
      (2)   A FUEL BREAK is defined as an area which is free of dead or dying
vegetation, and has native, fast-burning species sufficiently thinned so that
there is no interlocking canopy of this type of vegetation. Where necessary for
erosion control or aesthetic purposes, the fuel break may be planted in slow-
burning species. Fuel breaks do not involve stripping the ground of all native
vegetation.
      (3)   A primary fuel break will be installed, maintained and shall extend
a minimum of 30 feet in all directions around structures, excluding fences on
the property. The goal within this area is to remove ground cover that will
produce flame lengths in excess of one foot. Such a fuel break shall be
increased by five feet for each 10% increase in slope over 10%.
      (4)   A secondary fuel break will be installed, maintained and shall
extend a minimum of 100 feet beyond the primary fuel break where surrounding
landscape is owned and under the control of the property owner during
construction. The goal of the secondary fuel break is to reduce fuels so that
the overall intensity of any wildfire is reduced through fuels control.
      (5)   All structures shall be constructed or re-roofed with Class B or
better non-wood roofing materials, as determined by the current Building Code.
All re-roofing of existing structures in the wildfire lands area shall be done
under approval of a zoning permit. No structure shall be constructed or re-
roofed with wooden shingles, shakes, wood-product material or other combustible
roofing material, as defined in the current Building Code.
      (6)   Fuel breaks in areas which are also erosive or slope failure lands
shall be included in the erosion control measures outlined in §
156.238 of this chapter.

grading, filling or vegetation removal and, whenever possible, alternative
development should be considered.
   (B)   Development of floodways is not permitted, except for bridges and road
crossings. Such crossings shall be designed to pass the 100-year flood without
raising the upstream flood height more than six inches.
   (C)   New structures are not allowed on severe constraints lands.
   (D)   Other development of land or approval for a planning action shall be
allowed only when the following study has been accomplished. An engineering
geologic study approved by the City Engineer, Public Works Department and
Community Development Department establishes that the site is stable for the
proposed use and development. The study shall include the following:
      (1)   Index map;
      (2)   Project description to include location, topography, drainage,
vegetation and discussion of previous work and discussion of field exploration
methods;
      (3)   Site geology, based on a surficial survey, to include site geologic
maps, description of bedrock and surficial materials, including artificial
fill, locations of any faults, folds and the like, and structural data
including bedding, jointing and shear zones, soil depth and soil structure;
      (4)   Discussion of any off-site geologic conditions that may pose a
potential hazard to the site, or that may be affected by on-site development;
      (5)   Suitability of site for proposed development from a geologic
standpoint;
      (6)   Specific recommendations for cut slope stability, seepage and
drainage control or other design criteria to mitigate geologic hazards;

§ 156.256 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and
property of users in the Brigham City Airport and of occupants of land or to
property in its vicinity. Such hazard also reduces the size of the area
available for landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, and it tends to
destroy or impair the utility of the Brigham City Municipal Airport and the
public investment therein.
   (B)   Accordingly, it is declared:
      (1)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Brigham City Municipal
Airport;
      (2)   It is necessary in the interest of public health, public safety and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard be
prevented; and
      (3)   The prevention of those hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
   (C)   It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or
establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration,
mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public
purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and
acquire lands or interests in land.

approach zone shall rise one foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal
distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of
the precision instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the
end of the runway.
   (E)   Outer Approach Zone (AZ). The area within the FAR “Part 77” Outer
Approach Surface for Runway 35 is established at 10,200 feet from the end of
Runway 35 with a width of 2,500 feet widening thereafter uniformly to a width
of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond the end of the runway. This
approach zone will rise one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal
distance beginning at a point 10,200 feet from and at the centerline elevation
of the precision instrument runway and extending to a point 50,200 feet from
the end of the runway.
   (F)   Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   (G)   Horizontal Zones. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs
of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
Runway 35/17 and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
   (H)   Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

(Prior Code, § 29.22.010) (Ord. 13-14, passed 4-18-2013)
§ 156.296 ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   Air quality. Any land use in the North Shore development that produces
emissions to the air shall, at a minimum demonstrate compliance with all state
air quality standards, as evidenced by the issuance of any permits required for
their emissions by the state.
   (B)   Water quality and watershed protection. Land uses in the North Shore
Development Planned District shall be subject to any applicable requirements of
the city source protection zones.
   (C)   Sewage disposal.
      (1)   Connection to the city sewer is required for all land uses, except
as otherwise permitted by the city’s Waste Treatment Department under
applicable provisions of the city code.
      (2)   If permitted by the City Council, following a recommendation by the
city’s Waste Treatment Department and city’s Culinary Water Department,
alternative sewage disposal systems shall be sited and constructed in
accordance with applicable health regulations and standards of the city, the
county and the state.
   (D)   Revegetation/erosion protection/runoff control. To the extent
possible, plans for the development of the North Shore Development and actual
construction of infrastructure and land uses shall provide for the preservation
of existing vegetation; shall provide for appropriate, prompt revegetation or
erosion protection measures; and shall provide for surface water runoff control
in accordance with the city’s Public Works Standards and Technical
Specifications or modifications thereto granted pursuant to the procedure for
such modifications.
      (1)   Storm water created by the development shall be detained on the
property and released according to standard engineering calculations and
practices, except as such practices may be modified for the North Shore
Development. Existing natural storm water drainage shall be allowed to follow
the current natural drainage patterns. due to the unique setting and rural
environment of the property, storm water management may be accomplished through
the use of roadside swales and permeable basins allowing storm water to
infiltrate into the ground. Design and construction of such storm water
management features shall be subject to restrictions of the city’s source
protection zones, if applicable.
      (2)   All developments shall minimize the area disturbed by construction
activities at any given time.
      (3)   Buildings shall not be located on soils with severe limitations for
any of the proposed uses, unless fully mitigated by appropriate design and
construction techniques. Limitations on development may be due to any of a
number of factors including the depth to bedrock or a water table, soil
permeability, the soil’s propensity to shrink and swell and other factors.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.020)
§ 156.297 CRITICAL AREAS.
   Development within critical areas, as defined in divisions (A) through (C)
below, is prohibited.
   (A)   Geologic hazards. The development layout and design shall avoid areas
which may be adversely affected by geologic hazards.
      (1)   This prohibition may be waived in cases where the developer
demonstrates to the Planning Commission that the geologic hazard is fully
mitigated by appropriate design and construction techniques.
      (2)   Geologic hazards include ground subsidence that may result from
natural or human-made conditions and also any kind of seismic activity.
   (B)   Floodplains. All areas within a 100-year floodplain as mapped for the
Federal Flood Insurance program, or as calculated by a qualified engineer, or
where the prevailing or potential natural vegetation is riparian in nature, are
declared to be critical to the maintenance of the North Shore Development’s
hydrologic systems, fisheries and wildlife habitat. Development of floodplain
areas has a significant potential to adversely affect wildlife, water quality
and, if it modifies the floodway, adjoining, upstream and downstream
properties, roads and other public facilities. Development in floodplain areas
may also be constrained by a high water table which raises the cost of
installing and maintaining utilities. Finally, floodplain development adversely
affects all taxpayers through public expenditures to prevent or clean up flood
damages.
      (1)   Development, other than open use recreation, shall be prohibited in
areas that include 100- year floodplains. Structures shall not be permitted in
a 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   Road and driveway crossings shall bridge over all 100-year
floodplains. The installation of culverts for such purposes shall be minimized
and is generally not appropriate.
      (3)   Where 100-year floodplain areas are modified any action that may
increase flood hazards or adversely affect water quality or fisheries shall be
avoided. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, stream channel
modifications, the storage of floatable or potentially polluting materials and
the construction of stream crossings.
      (4)   Plantings or natural areas (as opposed to scrap metal, junked
vehicles or concrete slabs) shall be used where stream channels are required to
be stabilized. Riprap may be utilized if approved in advance through the
development review process and integrated with a planting plan.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.030)
§ 156.298 WATER AND WATER SUPPLY.
   (A)   For individual subdivisions and development proposals, the developer
shall submit a site plan prepared by a professional engineer showing the
property boundary with topography, proposed building envelopes and proposed
public and private roads and streets. The submittal shall show infrastructure
necessary to serve the proposed development with a water system designed in
compliance with the Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical
Specifications, or applicable modifications thereto, to be dedicated to the
city, serving all building lots. A publicly dedicated water system is necessary
for the following purposes:
      (1)   To protect existing and future city water rights and water sources;
      (2)   To provide an efficient and reliable water source for fire
prevention and suppression; and
      (3)   To provide development sites with an efficient and reliable source
of water for culinary and other uses.
   (B)   All development shall be designed, constructed and maintained in
compliance with applicable city source protection zones. Source protection
restrictions must be binding on all heirs, successors and assigns. Any land use
restrictions required to insure compliance with source protection restrictions
must be recorded with the property description in the County Recorder’s office.
Copies of this recording must be submitted to the city’s Culinary Water
Department for review.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.040)
§ 156.299 SANITARY SEWER.
   (A)   (1)   For individual subdivisions and development proposals, the
developer shall submit a site plan prepared by a professional engineer showing
the property boundary with topography, proposed building envelopes and proposed
public and private roads and streets. The submittal shall show infrastructure
necessary to serve the proposed development with a sanitary sewer system
serving all building lots. A sanitary sewer system is necessary for the
following purposes:
         (a)   To protect existing and future city water sources from
contamination;
         (b)   To provide development sites with an efficient and reliable
system for the treatment of sewage and waste water; and
         (c)   To protect water bodies on and adjacent to the property subject
to this planned district from contamination.
      (2)   The system shall be designed in compliance with the Brigham City
Public Works Standards and Technical Specifications, or applicable
modifications thereto.
   (B)   Easements or rights-of-way required for sewer service by the city’s
Waste Treatment Department shall be provided by all developments proposing
public sewer systems prior to final subdivision plat or final development plan
approval.
   (C)   Where the city sanitary sewer capital facilities plan calls for sewer
main sizes through a development that are larger than necessary to serve the
development, the larger main shall be installed in accordance with city policy.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.050)
§ 156.300 FIRE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Water infrastructure and water supply shall be in place and
serviceable prior to any combustible construction.
   (B)   (1)   The city’s Fire Department has established the acceptable
emergency response time as ten minutes or less within the district. an
acceptable response time to larger scale development may actually be less, as
determined by the city’s Fire Department. (It must be realized that prevailing
weather conditions, general topography, geographical diversities and unusual
traffic conditions may inhibit Fire Department response times at any time of
year.)
      (2)   In order to comply with an acceptable level of service standard, a
developer may be required to provide appropriate fire protection
infrastructure, including facilities, apparatus and equipment for the city’s
Fire Department to comply with the appropriate level of service standard. In
addition, approved fire sprinkler and suppression systems may be required by
the Fire Marshal in conjunction with other appropriate mitigation measures,
which must be approved by the Fire Marshal, to comply with the required level
of service standard.
      (3)   If the city’s Fire Marshal determines that a desired level of
service cannot be provided to a proposed development, the developer shall
prepare and submit a fire protection mitigation plan to the Fire Marshal for
review and approval. This plan shall address the measures that will be used to
comply with the intent of the level of service standard, and the timing/phasing
in which such measures will be provided. An acceptable mitigation plan shall be
approved by the city’s Fire Marshal before a final subdivision plan or final
site plan approval is granted. Failure of a developer to provide an acceptable
plan may be cause for denial of a development application by the city.
   (C)   (1)   All proposed new subdivisions or developments will be analyzed
and rated for wildfire risk using the fire hazard severity scale developed by
the state’s Division of State Lands and Forestry. All of these factors can vary
from development to development. The composite score will categorize the hazard
level of the proposed development. Once a proposed subdivision or development
has been classified as to its hazard level, development standards for each
level can be used by the city’s Fire Marshal to guide fire protection and
wildfire prevention measures. This rating shall be submitted to the city at the
initial stage of a subdivision application, as required by the Fire Marshal, or
as otherwise required in the processing of development permits for any proposed
development. The rating scale is based on five separate factors:
         (a)   Slope: this factor is displayed as a percentage. It is
calculated by measuring the vertical distance and horizontal distance for a
given area, and dividing the vertical by the horizontal;
         (b)   Aspect: this factor is the cardinal direction in which the
surface of the ground faces;
         (c)   Response time of fire agency: this factor is measured in minutes
it takes the nearest responsible fire agency to respond to a fire in a given
area;
         (d)   Type of vegetation: this factor is categorized by fuel types.
Rates of spread, resistance to control and potential to cause structural damage
are the criteria for rating severity; and
         (e)   Vegetation density: this factor is considered the total
combustible vegetation that may be available as a fuel for wildfire.
      (2)   (a)   Hazardous fuels in the form of native vegetation will be
cleared around structures and around the perimeter of the development to assist
in wildfire prevention measures. This fuel break is not intended as a complete
vegetation clearing fire break. Fuel breaks must be in place prior to occupancy
of the structure.
         (b)   The definition of a fuel break by the state’s Division of Lands
and Forestry is “a change in fuel continuity, type of fuel or degree of
flammability of fuel in a strategically located parcel or strip of land to
reduce or hinder the rate of fire spread”.
         (c)   Fuel breaks shall consist of the following:
            1.   Grasses within 30 feet of structures shall be mowed to four
inches or less;
            2.   Ground litter shall be removed annually;
            3.   Over mature, dead and dying trees shall be evaluated as to
their potential to ignite and to carry fire and possibly will be removed;
            4.   Fuel breaks may contain individual tree specimens, ornamental
plants or other similar vegetation used as ground cover; provided, they will
not provide a means of transmitting wildfire from native vegetation to
structures; and
            5.   Fire resistive vegetation shall be planted in the fuel breaks
to prevent undue soil erosion.
         (d)   A maintained fuel break easement around the perimeter of any
development shall be dedicated in favor of the city and shall be shown on the
final recorded subdivision plat of a subdivision or the final approved site
plan of a development not requiring subdivision. The easement shall be recorded
by separate deed for development plans not requiring subdivision of land. Fuel
breaks must be maintained by the landowners and a requirement for such
maintenance shall be included as a stipulation in private covenants recorded as
part of any subdivision plat approval. In subdivisions, planned unit
developments, or other developments where a homeowners’ or other association of
property owners is created, such association shall be responsible for
monitoring of the fuel break easement. private covenants for the subdivision,
planned unit development, or other development shall include language enabling
the homeowners’ or other property owners’ association to budget for and provide
fuel break maintenance services around the perimeter of the development
boundary.
         (e)   The following chart identifies fuel break clearing limits around
structures and development perimeters based on the wildfire hazard rating:
 
Type                   Moderate High    Extreme
Development perimeters None     75 feet 100 feet
Structures             30 feet  50 feet 100 feet
 
   (D)   Certification of compliance with adopted service levels and standards
of the city’s Fire Department, shall occur prior to final site plan approval,
or in the case of a single-family dwelling unit or any use approved as a
conditional use or a permitted use, before a building permit is issued for such
development.
   (E)   Fire hydrants, water line sizes, water storage for fire protection and
minimum flow for fire protection shall be determined by using the standards of
the Insurance Services Office, which are known as the fire system grading
standards and the city’s Public Works Standards and Technical Specifications.
In no case shall minimum fire flow be less than 1,000 gallons per minute for a
period of two hours, unless otherwise permitted herein, or as approved by the
Fire Marshal.
   (F)   (1)   All recorded subdivision plats for the North Shore Development
shall include the following note. In developments not requiring subdivision of
land, an affidavit containing the following note shall be recorded against the
subject property in the County Recorder’s office.
      (2)   The property owner acknowledges that he or she is building in a
rural environment adjacent to lands managed primarily for natural values
including wildlife habitat and agriculture. As such, the property owner is on
notice that public services in the area are subject to the constraints inherent
to such environments.
      (3)   Emergency response time may be longer than it is in more accessible
areas, and access by emergency vehicles may be impeded at times due to weather
and road conditions. The owner understands and acknowledges that wildfire risks
are higher in the North Shore Development than in other areas of the city. By
this notice, the property owner assumes the risk of occupancy as outlined
above.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.060)

road, as designated on the General Development Plan or subsequent development
plans shall be 600 feet.
      (3)   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac on a rural designated road, as
designated on the General Development Plan or subsequent development plans
shall be as follows, unless the Fire Marshal agrees to other lengths. The
length of these cul-de-sacs shall be based on the wildfire hazard rating of the
surrounding area.
 
Wildfire Hazard Rating Maximum Length
Moderate               1,200 feet
High                   900 feet
Extreme                500 feet
 
      (4)   The cul-de-sac shall not be less than 60 feet in diameter, or as
required by the Fire Marshal and City Engineer.
      (5)   A hammerhead cul-de-sac design may be allowed at the discretion of
the Fire Marshal.
      (6)   All cul-de-sacs must include signage indicating that the road is a
dead end road within 50 feet of the outlet.
   (D)   Bridges and culverts. Bridges and culverts shall be constructed to
support a gross vehicle weight of 40,000 pounds and shall have vehicle load
limits posted. Permanent culverts shall be installed at all intermittent and
perennial stream crossings. Specifications for bridges, culverts and other
stream crossing devices shall take into account at least the 25-year frequency
storm and upstream debris hazard. If the development is within a 100-year
floodplain, then 100-year frequency storm shall be used in drainage design.
   (E)   Traffic control and street signage.
      (1)   All roads will be designated with road names and signs will be
installed at each major road intersection. All lots and/or home sites will be
visibly signed with street addresses and numbered as such. Emergency access
roads shall be clearly identified.
      (2)   All roads shall be named or numbered in accordance with the city’s
addressing system and road identification signs in accordance with city
standards and specifications. All permitted occupied structures shall post
addresses prior to occupancy.
      (3)   The developer shall be responsible for the expense of constructing
and placing traffic- control signs, as follows.
         (a)   Stop signs shall be placed at all intersections of arterials; of
collectors and arterials; and when appropriate as determined by the City
Engineer, local streets/roads and collectors.
         (b)   Yield signs shall be required at the intersection of all other
streets and roads when determined by the Streets Department.
   (F)   Snow removal and road maintenance on private roads. Snow removal and
road maintenance on private roads will be the responsibility of the respective
property owner or homeowners’ association and will be noted as such on the
recorded plat of any subdivision which includes private streets. The CC&Rs for
the development shall include enforcement language for mandatory budgeting by
the association to provide snow removal and road maintenance services. When no
homeowners’ association exists, snow removal shall be the responsibility of the
owner of the private street.
   (G)   Pedestrian access.
      (1)   Sidewalks, pedestrian walkways or non-motorized trails shall be
provided for internal pedestrian, bicycle and/or equestrian circulation within
developed portions of the North Shore Development.
      (2)   Sidewalks, walkways, and trails shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with the Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical
Specifications, as modified for the North Shore Development.
   (H)   Public utilities.
      (1)   All utilities shall be placed underground unless the City Council,
following recommendation by the City Planning Commission, with input from the
affected utility, determines that special conditions exist, other than cost,
which should permit the utility to be installed above ground.
      (2)   Natural gas service may be installed at the developer’s option.
Propane use must conform to all applicable provisions of the Uniform Fire Code.
      (3)   Rights-of-way or easements shall be provided as required by the

maintenance is anticipated shall provide adequate school bus loading and turn-
around areas, as evidenced by a written statement from the Box Elder School
District.
(Prior Code, § 29.22.070)
§ 156.302 SPECIAL SITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   These criteria serve the public interest by requiring that the design of
developments in the North Shore Development are compatible with the natural,
rural environment and characteristics of their setting and with the image of
the area which the city seeks to promote; helping to reduce the potential for
land use conflicts by encouraging the protection of privacy and scenic views;
and protecting the integrity of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge.
   (A)   Clustering of homes is encouraged to allow for reduced infrastructure
costs for roads, driveways and water and sanitary sewer systems when compared
with conventional design, and promote the visual integrity of development as
viewed from within the development.
   (B)   Development in the North Shore Development Planned District shall be
integrated in a manner that is consistent with the city’s General Plan and the
General Development Plan for the North Shore Development. Integration shall be

between the vertical axis and the first line of sight at which the bare source
is not visible.
      FOOT-CANDLE. A unit of illuminance amounting to on lumen per square foot.
      FULLY SHIELDED.
         (a)   Outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light
rays are emitted by the installed fixtures at angles above the horizontal
plane.
         (b)   This means that the shield is not flush or parallel with the
light source or bulb.
         (c)   This is referred to in this document as a cut-off-fixture.
      GLARE. The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that
is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to
cause annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and visibility.
      ILLUMINANCE. The quantity of light, or luminous flux, arriving at a
surface divided by the area of the illuminated surface, measured in lux or
foot-candles.
      INSTALLED. The initial installation of outdoor light fixtures defined
herein, following the effective date of this subchapter, but shall not apply to
those outdoor light fixtures installed prior to such date.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 156.425 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the planned unit development is to allow
diversification in the relationship of various uses and structures to their
sites, and to permit more flexibility in the use of such sites.
   (B)   The application of planned unit concepts is intended to encourage
excellence in neighborhood, housing or area design, while insuring substantial
compliance with the intent of the General Plan, district regulations and other
provisions of this chapter relating to the public health, safety and general
welfare, and at the same time securing the advantages of large-scale site
planning for residential, commercial or industrial developments, or
combinations thereof.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.010) (Ord. 98-11, passed 3-19-1998)
§ 156.426 DEFINITION.
   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, for the purposes of this chapter, shall mean an
integrated design for development of residential, commercial or industrial
uses, or combinations of such uses, in which one or more of the regulations,
other than use regulations, of the district in which the development is to be

general requirements as specified in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.020)
§ 156.427 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   Planned unit developments may be allowed by Planning Commission approval in
any zoning district. No such planned unit development permit shall be granted
unless such development will meet the use limitations of the zoning district in
which it is to be located, including planned unit developments in planned
districts, and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except
as such requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this subchapter or
by district regulations. Compliance with the regulations of this chapter in no
sense excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of Chapter 155 of
this code of ordinances, except as modifications thereof are specifically
authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development.

approved by the Planning Commission as adequate for the proposed development.
No minimum area is specified.
      (2)   However, planned unit developments of any size may be allowed only
upon a finding of fact by the Planning Commission that the plan complies with
the intent of the General Plan, and incorporates excellence of neighborhood,
housing or area design, that will compensate for the effects upon the
neighborhood of deviations from district regulations.
   (B)   A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in
the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of
zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning
amendment; except that, any residential use shall be considered a permitted use
in a planned unit development which allows residential uses and shall be
governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit
development permit.
   (C)   The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time
of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of
the property.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall require such arrangements of structures
and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to assure that
adjacent properties will not be adversely affected:
      (1)   Density of land use intensity shall in no case be more than 25%
higher than allowed in the zoning district, except not more than 10% higher in
residential districts;
      (2)   Where feasible, least height and intensity of buildings and uses
shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development; and
      (3)   Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations
shall be determined by approval of the site development plan.
   (E)   Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open spaces within
the development shall be accomplished by:
      (1)   Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system;
      (2)   Granting to the local jurisdiction a permanent, open space easement
on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space
remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being
the responsibility of an owners’ association established with articles of
association and by-laws which are satisfactory to the governing body; or
      (3)   Complying with the provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act of
1963, being U.C.A. Title 57, Chapter 8, or its successor statute, as per Utah
Code, which provides for the payment of common expenses for the up keep of the
common areas and facilities.
   (F)   Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the several uses within
the site and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its
surroundings shall be planned and presented to the Planning Commission for
approval, together with other required plans for the development.
   (G)   The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the
intensity and direction of area or flood-lighting shall be detailed in the
application.
   (H)   A grading and drainage plan shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission with the application.
   (I)   A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be
prepared for the entire site to be developed.
   (J)   The proposed use of the particular location shall be shown as
necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility which will contribute
to the general well-being of the neighborhood and the community.
   (K)   It shall be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case,
the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or general
welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned unit development.

§ 156.429 USES ALLOWED.
   Subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission, uses allowed
in a planned unit development shall be those uses allowed in the planned
district or other zoning district in which the planned unit development is to
be located; provided that, for the purposes of this subchapter and chapter,
multiple-family dwellings may be allowed in a planned unit development approved
in a single-family zoning district; provided, the overall density of the
development does not exceed 10% above the density normally allowed for single-
family dwellings in said district.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.050)
§ 156.430 GENERAL SITE PLAN.

vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking, public uses such as schools and
playgrounds, landscaping and other open spaces;
   (C)   Architectural drawings and sketches outlining the general design and
character of the proposed uses and the physical relationship of the uses; and
   (D)   Such other pertinent information, including residential density,
coverage and open space characteristics, shall be included as may be necessary
to make a determination that the contemplated arrangement of buildings and uses
makes it desirable to apply regulations and requirements differing from those
ordinarily applicable under this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.060)
§ 156.431 REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   In order that it may approve a planned unit development, the Planning

others it deems appropriate) be met by the applicant:
   (A)   The proponents of the planned unit development have demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that they are financially able to
carry out the proposed project;
   (B)   The proponents intend to start construction within one year of the
approval of the project and any necessary zoning district change, and intend to
complete said construction, or approved stages thereof, within four years from
the date construction begins;
   (C)   Application for planned unit development in planned districts meets
the requirements of such districts, including the requirements of the General
Development Plan;
   (D)   The development is planned as one complex land use rather than as an
aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses; and
   (E)   The development as planned will accomplish the purpose outlined in §
156.425 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.070)
§ 156.432 SCOPE OF PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION.
   In carrying out the intent of this subchapter, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following principles.
   (A)   It is the intent of this subchapter that site and building plans for a
planned unit development shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers
having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the
application. The Commission may require the applicant to engage such a
qualified designer or design team.
   (B)   It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a
planned unit development by the Planning Commission be so rigidly exercised
that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense
incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised
be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this subchapter.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may approve or disapprove an application for a
planned unit development. In an approval, the Commission may attach such
conditions as it may deem necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set
forth in §
156.425 of this chapter. The approval or denial of an application for a planned
unit development by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Appeal
Authority. All appeals must be filed with the Community Development Department

and with any conditions imposed in conjunction with its approval.
(Prior Code, § 29.25.090)
OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
§ 156.445 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these off-street parking requirements is to reduce congestion
and traffic hazards within the city by incorporating adequate, attractively-
designed off-street parking and loading facilities for various land uses.
Parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that they will result in
maximum efficiency, protection of public safety, provide for the special needs
of the handicapped and, where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from
adverse impacts created by such parking.
(Prior Code, § 29.26.010)
§ 156.446 GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   New development. The off-street parking standards of this
subchapter apply to any new development and to any new use established.
      (2)   Expansions and alterations. The off-street parking standards of
this subchapter apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or
enlarged. Additional off-street parking spaces shall be required only to serve
the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. The Planning
Commission may require increases in parking for non-complying parking areas
when found necessary to ensure adequate off-street parking.
      (3)   Change of use. Off-street parking shall be required for any change
of use or change of operation that would result in a requirement for more
parking than the existing use. Additional parking shall be required only in
proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use.
      (4)   Required areas. Areas for deliveries and loading shall be required
as a part of the site plan review to ensure that loading and deliveries do not
constrain fire access, street safety or use public streets for deliveries.
   (B)   Parking and loading areas to be maintained. All off-street parking and
loading area within the city shall comply with all of the standards prescribed
in this subchapter, and shall be permanently maintained in good condition for
the duration of the use or uses served by the facility. All paved areas shall
be maintained in good repair without broken parts, potholes or litter.
(Prior Code, § 29.26.020)
§ 156.447 SITE, ACCESS AND LIGHTING PLAN REQUIRED.
   All applications for a building permit shall be accompanied by a detailed
site, access and lighting plan showing the required off-street parking spaces
and points of access. Parking lots with less than five spaces are not required
to submit a lighting plan.
(Prior Code, § 29.26.030)

Parking spaces for                            herein for uses which are similar to the use not
uses not specified                             specified. Appeals to the decision of the Community
                                               Development Director or designee are made to the
                                               Appeal Authority as designated in §§
                                               156.055 through
                                               156.057  of this chapter
 
   (B)   Rules for computing requirements. The following rules apply when
computing off-street parking and loading requirements:
      (1)   Multiple uses: parking for multiple use sharing the parking shall
comply with the requirements of §
156.452 of this chapter for shared parking;
      (2)   Fractions: if, in the application of the requirements of this
subchapter, a fractional number is obtained, any fraction will be disregarded;
      (3)   Area measurements: unless otherwise specifically noted, all square
footage-based parking and loading standards are to be computed on the basis of
gross floor area;
      (4)   Occupancy-based standards: for the purpose of computing parking
based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be
based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum
enrollment or the maximum fire rated capacity, whichever is applicable and
whichever results in the greater number of spaces; and
      (5)   Unlisted uses: upon receiving a development application for a use
not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Community
Development Director or designee shall apply the off-street parking standard
specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or
require a parking study in accordance with this subchapter.
   (C)   Off-street parking for land uses with unique parking requirements.
Off-street parking for land uses with unique parking requirements and uses
which have widely varying parking demand characteristics, make it impossible to
specify a single off-street parking standard. Uses found by the Community
Development Director or designee to have unique parking requirements shall
comply with the provisions of this section.
      (1)   A developer proposing to develop or expand a land use with unique
parking requirements shall submit a parking study that provides justification
for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed.
      (2)   The Community Development Department and City Engineer shall review
this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the
establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed
use.
      (3)   (a)   A parking study shall include estimates of parking based on
recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other
acceptable estimates as approved by the Public Works Department, and should
include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that
are the same as or comparable with the proposed use.
         (b)   Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area,
type of activity, location or parameters of the use that may be estimated to
parking requirements.
      (4)   (a)   The study shall document the source of data used, and methods
used to develop their recommendations.
         (b)   After reviewing the parking study, the Community Development
Department and City Engineer shall establish a minimum off-street parking
standard for the proposed use.
      (5)   Appeals of the administrative decision may be made to the Appeal
Authority in accordance with the procedures of §§
156.055 through
156.057 of this chapter.
   (D)   Parking requirement within the Historical Brigham City Downtown.
      (1)   The boundary of the Historical Brigham City Downtown shall be
defined as those properties that front on or within the boundary of 100 North
to 200 South and 100 East to 100 West.
      (2)   The protection of the buildings and the historical environment
within the historical downtown should be overall objective when considering
parking within this area.

NATURAL RESOURCE EXCAVATION
§ 156.505 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to permit natural resource extractive and
related uses such as mines, quarries, gravel pits, rock crushers, concrete
batching plants and asphalt plants, and to provide for the orderly removal of
mineral resources and the reclamation of the areas from which mineral resources
are taken. This subchapter is further intended to protect the environmental,
ecological, scenic and visual resources of the city from undue impacts
resulting from such uses.
(Prior Code, § 29.28.010) (Ord. 00-03, passed 1-20-2000)
§ 156.506 APPLICATION OF SUBCHAPTER.
   The application of this subchapter and a conditional use permit for natural
resource excavation and related uses as specified in §
156.088 of this chapter will be considered only where all of the following
tests are met:
   (A)   The resource is available;
   (B)   Existing land uses are buffered; and
   (C)   Natural resource excavation and related uses are consistent with the
goals of the city’s General Plan.

§ 156.507 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Words and
phrases not defined in this section, but defined in §
156.020 of this chapter, shall be given the meanings thus set forth. All other
words and phrases shall be given their common, ordinary meaning, unless the
context clearly requires otherwise. Section headings or captions are for
reference purposes only and shall not be used in the interpretation of this
subchapter.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership,
receiver, trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, fiduciary, agent or other
organization or representative of any kind either public or private, submitting
an application for natural resource excavation approval.
   EXCAVATION. The removal of natural resources by excavating, stripping,
leveling or any other process, together with all other types of mining
operations where natural resources are removed from the earth. The provisions
of this subchapter shall not apply to the removal of sod or topsoil; provided
that, any removal of sod or topsoil shall not be closer than ten feet to any
property line, involve excavation depths in excess of 18 inches or adversely
affect the drainage, stability, vegetation or air quality of the area. Further,
this subchapter shall not apply to ditching and land leveling for agricultural
purposes, so long as such land leveling for agricultural purposes does not
include the removal of natural resources from the site for other uses.
   OPERATION. Those activities conducted on the surface of the land directly
involved in or incidental to the exploration for, or development or extraction
of, natural resources from their natural occurrences, including surface mining
and surface effects of underground mining, on-site transportation and other
processing.
   OPERATOR. Any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, receiver,
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, fiduciary, agent or other
organization or representative of any kind either public or private, owning,
controlling or managing natural resource excavation operations or proposed
operations, including exploring for or developing of a mineral deposit.
   OWNER. Any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, receiver,
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, fiduciary, agent or other
organization or representative of any kind either public or private, owning,

existing as a separate legal description with a separate tax identification
number on or before 2-19-1998. Land in one ownership, but with more than one
legal description or tax identification number, shall not be considered one
PARCEL. Land assembled into one legal description or tax identification number
after 2-19-1998 shall not be considered one PARCEL for purposes of this zoning
regulation. Land in one ownership, but physically divided by a public or
private highway, road or street, is not considered contiguous under this
definition.
   PERMITTEE. An owner or operator who has received or is in the process of
applying for a conditional use permit for natural resource excavation.
   RECLAMATION. Actions performed during and after natural resource excavation
operations to shape, stabilize, re-vegetate or otherwise treat the land
affected in order to achieve a safe, stable, ecological condition.

approved by the Planning Commission. The intent of this subchapter is to allow
the Planning Commission to conduct a review of a natural resource excavation
operation following an initial approval term to determine if impacts have
exceeded those foreseen in the initial review process and to allow conditions
to be added to the original approval to mitigate those impacts.
(Prior Code, § 29.28.100) (Ord. 00-03, passed 1-20-2000)
§ 156.515 CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS FOR NATURAL RESOURCE EXCAVATION.
   The following standards shall apply to all conditional use permits granted
under this subchapter. The Planning Commission may modify these standards or
attach additional conditions upon a finding by the Planning Commission that
such modifications or additional conditions are necessary to mitigate impacts
of natural resource excavation operations, as determined during a conditional
use permit review procedure.
   (A)   Buffer distances.
      (1)   All extractive operations, roads, machinery, equipment and
stockpiles (excluding top soil used for reclamation and screening and rock
crushing) shall be kept at least 100 feet horizontal distance from the boundary
with any other property owner, except as may be reduced by the Planning
Commission, but in no event should the operation be closer than 40 feet to the
property line, except as provided in §
156.517(C)(5) of this chapter.
      (2)   All screening and rock crushing operations shall be conducted at
least 400 feet horizontal distance from the boundary of any other property
owner (except as may be reduced by the Planning Commission, but in no event
shall the operation be closer than 50 feet to the property).
      (3)   All excavations shall be kept at least 100 feet from a public road,
except where the Planning Commission determines the excavations may be moved
closer if it will not endanger the users of the road.
   (B)   Fencing. Areas of excavation with serious or hazardous conditions
shall be reasonably fenced, except where in the determination of the Planning
Commission other suitable devices may be used.
   (C)   Grading. All grading, including slope stabilization, shall be done in
accordance with the latest reclamation plans, with the concurrence of the City
Engineer.
   (D)   Air quality. All air quality plans and actions shall be monitored and
approved by the state’s Division of Air Quality. The permittee shall obtain an
air quality approval order from the state’s Division of Air Quality prior to
the final approval of a conditional use permit. The air quality permit and
application for the permit shall be incorporated by reference into a
conditional use permit and shall be on file with the city. The permittee shall
establish to the satisfaction of the city, and as certified by the City
Engineer, the availability of water sufficient for required dust suppression
activities and reclamation. Acceptable opacity on-site shall be established
through the conditional use process and in consultation with the state’s
Division of Air Quality. All equipment and machinery, on-site and off-site,
utilized in the excavation and processing of native natural resources shall be
constructed, operated and maintained in such a manner as to minimize on-site
dust, smoke and odor, and to minimize off-site drift of dust, smoke and odor.
The Planning Commission may impose particular conditions to ensure that
fugitive dust suppression utilizes best available control technologies and to
establish air quality and fugitive dust monitoring and reporting procedures.
   (E)   Water quality. The washing of sand and gravel shall be done so as to
prevent the discharge of waste water onto any public or private roads or any
private property, or into a public or private river, stream, canal or waterway,
without the written consent of the owner and/or appropriate local, state or
federal jurisdiction. Water from wash plants shall be collected in evaporating
ponds and shall not be permitted to drain into waterways.
   (F)   Storm water. The entire area subject to a conditional use permit shall
be graded so that storm water remains on site. The site shall be graded so that
as the area is eventually reclaimed, storm drainage is properly managed in a
manner reviewed and approved by the City Engineer and Planning Commission. A
storm water discharge plan shall be incorporated into the conditional use
permit by reference.
   (G)   Tracking of material onto public streets. Trucks or other equipment
which exit the operations approved under a conditional use permit, whether
owned and operated by the permittee or others, and whether loaded or unloaded,
shall adhere to all laws (state, county or city) requiring that loads be
contained within the hauling vehicles. All vehicles exiting the operation site,
whether owned or operated by the permittee or others, and whether loaded or
unloaded shall be checked for material on the wheels before leaving the pit.
Any material outside a truck or other equipment exiting the operations approved
under a conditional use permit, whether owned or operated by permittee or
others, and whether loaded or unloaded shall be cleaned from the truck or
equipment.
   (H)   Hours and days of operation. Hours and days of operation shall be
established through the conditional use process as follows.
      (1)   The hours for mining operations, crushing and screening, and
hauling, except for the maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, shall
be established during the review of the applicant’s operation plan, but shall
not exceed the hours between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,
and Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
      (2)   Mining operations, crushing and screening, and hauling, except for
the maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, are prohibited on Sundays
and on the following holidays: New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Pioneer Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may vary these days and/or hours of
operation in specific cases upon a finding that unusual circumstances
associated with the particular case warrant such a variance and upon a finding
that no existing or anticipated residential use will be unduly impacted by such
varied hours and/or days of operation.
      (4)   During periods of national or unusual emergency, or in instances of
unusual contractual obligations or other factors, time and hours of operation
may be altered at the discretion of, and following formal approval by, the City
Council.
   (I)   Landscaping. Properties containing uses for which a conditional use
permit for natural resource excavation is required shall be landscaped for
purposes of screening such uses from public streets and abutting properties,
and providing for site reclamation planting. Vegetative materials shall be
planted together with necessary top soil as per the schedule approved in the
granting of the conditional use permit and shall be maintained in a healthy,
growing condition. The reclamation plan shall include a landscaping plan
prepared by a licensed landscape architect, and shall include a planting plan
and an irrigation plan. Landscaping shall be accomplished and maintained in
accordance with the approved Reclamation Plan and the guidelines established in
§
156.516 of this chapter.
   (J)   Lighting. Reflectors, spotlights, floodlights and other light sources
may be used to illuminate buildings, landscaping, signs, parking and loading
areas; provided, they are equipped with proper lenses or other devices
concentrating the illumination upon the building, landscaping, signs, parking
and loading areas and preventing any bright, direct illumination upon adjacent
property or any public right-of-way. No unshielded lights of any color,
reflectors, spotlights, strobe lights or searchlights shall be located in such
a manner that they are pointed toward or are directly visible from frequently
traveled public rights-of-way or adjacent properties.

      (1)   Trucks or other equipment which exit onto a city street from the
operations approved under a conditional use permit, whether owned and operated
by the permittee or others, and whether loaded or unloaded, shall travel only
on truck routes established by ordinance. The Planning Commission may establish
conditions mitigating the impact of traffic on city streets, school zones and
pedestrian routes. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to,
restrictions on hours of truck traffic, restrictions on vehicle size and
restrictions on speed.
      (2)   A traffic study shall be required as part of a mining operations
plan submittal. the traffic study shall address the following issues:
         (a)   Identify peak volumes;
         (b)   Identify measures to mitigate traffic impacts during critical
school times;
         (c)   Projected traffic generated by the operation; and
         (d)   Projected traffic levels on routes traveled by traffic generated
by the operation.
      (3)   Traffic and speed shall be monitored over the first year of
operations, and the Planning Commission shall conduct a review of traffic
routing following the first year of operation. At that time, the Planning
Commission may establish additional conditions related to transportation and
any such conditions shall become binding on the permittee, the property owner
or owners and any successors.
   (N)   Related manufacturing operations. The manufacture of concrete building
blocks or other similar items, the production or manufacture of lime products,
the production of ready-mixed concrete, the production of asphalt mixes and any
similar production or manufacturing processes which might be related to an
excavation operation shall not be permitted in association with such an
operation, except as expressly provided by a conditional use permit under this
subchapter.
   (O)   Monumentation. Monuments or other means of identification shall be
placed and maintained around the perimeter of the excavation site so as to
enable reasonable identification of the property line separating the excavation
property from adjoining land owners.
(Prior Code, § 29.28.110) (Ord. 00-03, passed 1-20-2000)
§ 156.516 RECLAMATION.
   (A)   Objectives. The objectives of excavation reclamation shall be:
      (1)   To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or
within a reasonable amount of time thereafter to a predetermined condition
defined by the reclamation plan as submitted and approved, compatible with
past, present or probable future local land uses, and consistent with the
city’s General Plan;
      (2)   To minimize or prevent present and future on-site or off-site
environmental degradation to the ecological and hydrological regimes caused by
mining operations, and to meet other pertinent state and federal regulations
regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria;
      (3)   To minimize or prevent present and future hazards to public safety
and welfare; and
      (4)   To ensure that the area of excavation shall be rehabilitated to a
condition of practical usefulness and reasonable physical attractiveness.
   (B)   Simultaneous excavation and reclamation.
      (1)   The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resources sites with a
projected life of more than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with
the excavation of the resource. The purpose and intent of simultaneous
excavation and reclamation includes but is not limited to the creation of a
usable land resource and the elimination of waste heaps, and the prevention of
shallow, stagnant, small bodies of water, small unusable remnants of land and
eroding, barren slopes all normally associated with open pit operations, except
as providing storm water detention facilities as described in a hydrological
report.
      (2)   Excavations shall be planned so as to progressively develop the
proposed final land forms by grading and by stockpiling overburden materials in
areas designated for future land forms or in excavations where the material
will be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated.
Such areas are to be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed
or within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and
planting shall be completed within one year. The reclamation plan shall contain
a description of the phased reclamation process throughout the anticipated life
of the mine.
   (C)   Final reclamation. Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any
site where operations authorized under a conditional use permit have been
abandoned for a period of at least one year, or otherwise terminated, as
determined by the Community Development Department. The final reclamation shall
conform to the plan approved (including approved modifications) in the
conditional use permit for natural resource excavation. All reclamation plans
shall conform at least to the below listed minimum standards and requirements
listed elsewhere in the ordinance; provided, however, that, the Planning
Commission may require more stringent standards where special hazards exist in
order to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the public, and to
prevent injury to property or improvements.
      (1)   Grading. Slopes, overburden stockpiles and abandoned soil piles
shall be graded and smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation
of potentially dangerous areas in accordance with the direction of the City
Engineer. The peaks and depressions of the reclamation area shall be reduced to
a surface which will result in topography in substantial conformity to the land
area generally surrounding and which will minimize erosion due to rainfall. In
no case shall any slope of a reclamation site exceed the normal angle of repose
of the material involved.
      (2)   Water-filled areas. All excavations which create standing water or
ponds shall be refilled with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply,
however, to any water-filled excavations scheduled to become an integral part
of the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done
in such a manner that the ground water is not polluted as determined through
consultation with the county’s Health Department. Fill material shall be porous
to allow for water dispersion unless otherwise specified in the reclamation
plan.
      (3)   Landscaping. Unless inconsistent with the final proposed use of the
reclaimed land, the excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be
replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs, grasses or other vegetative ground
cover, native to the area, in order to minimize erosion and to restore the land
to a natural appearance, or to an appearance previously approved by the
Planning Commission.
      (4)   Removal of buildings and equipment. Upon termination of excavation
and/or manufacturing, all buildings, equipment (including electrical conduits),
temporary structures (except fences), rock piles, rubble heaps or other debris
used in the excavation and/or mining operations, shall be removed unless deemed
necessary to the approved final use of the reclaimed site. If determined by the
City Engineer and Community Development Department to be acceptable, these
materials may be back-filled into the excavation.
      (5)   Reclamation. In the final year of excavation, the mining operation
may, as part of the reclamation project, excavate closer than 40 feet to any
property lines, but only upon a showing of compelling mutual good and the
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Reclamation verification. At the conclusion of mining operation and
reclamation of the excavation site, the Community Development Department and
City Engineer shall present to the Planning Commission a statement verifying
the permit area has been reclaimed in compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter and reclamation plans previously submitted in compliance with this
subchapter. The Planning Commission shall certify to the City Council that all
requirements of this subchapter have been met.
(Prior Code, § 29.28.120) (Ord. 00-03, passed 1-20-2000)
§ 156.517 PROVISION OF SURETY.
   (A)   Provision of surety before operations begin. After receiving
notification that the application for a natural resource permit has been
approved, but prior to commencement of such operation, the operator shall
provide surety to the city, in a form and amount to be determined by the
Planning Commission in consultation with the City Engineer.
   (B)   Amount of surety. In determining the amount of surety to be provided,
the Planning Commission shall consider factual information as to the magnitude,
type and costs of approved reclamation activities planned for the land affected
and the nature, extent and duration of operations under the approval notice.
The Planning Commission shall fix the amount of the bond at an amount
reasonably related thereto, to protect the city and ensure compliance with the
requirements of the conditional use permit; however, the amount of the bond
shall not exceed 125% of the estimated cost of rehabilitating the excavation.
The bond shall be periodically reviewed to insure that the amount of the bond
is capable of ensuring adequate reclamation.
   (C)   Form of surety. In determining the form of surety to be provided by
the owner, the Planning Commission shall approve a method acceptable to the
owner and consistent with the requirements of this subchapter which may be one
or a combination of corporate surety bond, land, cash or other deposited
securities.
   (D)   Release of surety. The liability under surety provisions shall
continue until such time as it is released as to part, or in its entirety, by
the City Council.
   (E)   Forfeiture of surety. If the operator fails or refuses to carry out
the necessary land reclamation as outlined in the approved operation and
reclamation plans, the Planning Commission may, after notice and hearing,
declare any surety filed for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate
bond file suit against the owner and his or her bonding company. The city shall
also have the right to file suit against the defaulting permittee for costs of
rehabilitation and reasonable attorney’s fees.

HOME OCCUPATIONS
§ 156.545 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this subchapter to allow persons residing in
dwellings to use their mental or physical expertise and talent in providing a
service, developing a product for sale to the public, operating certain kinds
of small businesses or maintaining a professional or business office work space
in the dwelling or in an attached or detached garage or accessory building, or
yard space, while at the same time maintaining the peace, quiet and domestic
tranquility within all residential areas of the city, guaranteeing to all
residents freedom from excessive noise, traffic, nuisances, hazards and other
possible adverse effects of limited business activities being conducted in such
areas, and improving and maintaining the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood
and the lot or parcel upon which the dwelling and home occupation are located.
It is further the purpose and intent of this subchapter that home occupations
shall be clearly accessory and subordinate to the principal use of the property
for dwelling purposes.
(Prior Code, § 29.30.010) (Ord. 00-32, passed 8-17-2000)
§ 156.546 STANDARDS FOR HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The following standards shall be observed in the operation of all home
occupations.
   (A)   The home occupation shall be conducted primarily by residents of the
premises. A home occupation may have employees; however, only one employee who
does not live in the home may come to the home at any one time for purposes of
employment, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. One
additional off-street parking stall shall be provided for any employee coming
to the home who is not a resident of the premises. This parking stall shall be
subject to setback standards for the zoning district in which the home
occupation is located.
   (B)   The home occupation shall not physically change the dwelling or
accessory structure or attached or detached garage or yard space to the extent
that it would alter the residential or aesthetic character of the dwelling,
accessory structure, attached or detached garage, yard or neighborhood.
   (C)   The home occupation shall be allowed one name plate sign which shall
be consistent with §§
156.480 through
156.491 of this chapter. Temporary signs shall not be permitted for home
occupations.
   (D)   The home occupation shall not generate pedestrian or vehicular traffic
in excess of that customarily associated with the zone in which the use is
located, as determined by the Community Development Department and appropriate
regulatory authorities. Occupancy load, as defined by the currently adopted
Uniform Building Code, shall not be exceeded.
   (E)   The home occupation shall not cause a demand for municipal or utility
services or community facilities in excess of those usually and customarily
provided for residential use, as determined by the Community Development
Department and appropriate regulatory authorities. No electrical equipment
shall be permitted which exceeds three horsepower.
   (F)   Sale of commodities produced on the premises shall be permitted. The
sale of commodities not produced on the premises shall be by prior individual
invitation only.
   (G)   Home occupations shall conform to business license requirements of
Title XI of this code of ordinances.
   (H)   There shall be complete conformity with all applicable city, county,
state and federal laws and ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 29.30.020) (Ord. 01-22, passed 4-19-2001; Ord. 02-08, passed 3-
7-2002) Penalty, see §
156.999
§ 156.547 STANDARDS FOR HOME OCCUPATIONS USING ATTACHED OR DETACHED GARAGES,
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES OR YARD SPACE.
   (A)   The use of an accessory structure or an attached or detached garage,
or yard space, for a home occupation may be considered as a conditional use
only under the following conditions.
      (1)   The Planning Commission finds that the proposed home occupation
will be clearly accessory and subordinate to the principal use of the property
for dwelling purposes.
      (2)   The Planning Commission finds that the proposed home occupation
will not adversely affect the residential nature and aesthetic quality of the
neighborhood.
      (3)   Any off-street parking displaced by the home occupation is
relocated elsewhere on the lot or parcel in compliance with setback standards
for the zoning district in which the property is located.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may impose any conditions it deems
necessary to mitigate impacts of the home occupation on the neighborhood.
   (B)   (1)   In determining whether to grant a conditional use approval for
the use of an attached or detached garage, accessory structure or yard space
for a home occupation, the Planning Commission shall consider the effect of
such use on the residential character of the property upon which the home
occupation is proposed to be located.
      (2)   In making a determination, the Planning Commission may consider
factors including, but not limited to, displacement of normally residential
functions of yard space and building or structure usage; the potential for
generation of noise, dust, vapors, fumes, odors and light; the potential for
generation of excess traffic; the potential impact of the proposed home
occupation on the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood and the property upon
which the home occupation is proposed to be located.
   (C)   Due to the special nature of home occupations, their potential to
create adverse impacts to the neighborhood, and the potential for significant
unforeseen impacts to occur, the Planning Commission reserves the right to
review any home occupation granted conditional use approval pursuant to this
paragraph. The conditional use permit for the home occupation may be reviewed
and modified or revoked by the Planning Commission due to failure of the owner
or operator of the home occupation to observe all conditions specified in
issuing the permit, failure to observe the purpose and intent of this
subchapter, other requirements of this chapter in regards to the maintenance of
improvements, conduct of the home occupation as approved or significant
unforeseen impacts resulting from the operation of the home occupation in
conflict with the purpose and intent of this subchapter.
   (D)   Home occupations which may be considered under §
156.546 of this chapter may include the following uses or uses which are
similar in character, origin or impact, as determined by the Community
Development Department:
      (1)   Artist, author;
      (2)   Architectural service;
      (3)   Barber shop, beauty service;
      (4)   Consulting service;
      (5)   Craft sale;
      (6)   Dance studio; aerobic exercise, music lessons, tutoring and general
educational instruction;
      (7)   Direct sales distribution;
      (8)   Data processing, computer programming;
      (9)   Home crafts;
      (10)   Garden plants and produce;
      (11)   Janitorial service;
      (12)   Insurance sales or broker;
      (13)   Interior design;
      (14)   Mail order (not including retail sales form site);
      (15)   Real estate sales or broker; and
      (16)   Sales representative.
   (E)   Home occupations which shall not be considered under §
156.546 of this chapter include the following uses or uses which are similar in
character, original or impact, as determined by the Community Development
Department:

   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide specific regulations for
the placement, construction and modification of commercial personal wireless
telecommunications facilities on public and private property, and in the public
right-of-way. The provisions of this subchapter are not intended to and shall
not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this
subchapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between
providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent
that any provision or provisions of this subchapter are inconsistent or in
conflict with any other provision of the city code or any ordinance of the
city, the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to control.
   (B)   In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under
this subchapter made by an applicant to provide commercial personal wireless
service or to install commercial personal wireless service facilities, the
Planning Commission shall act within a reasonable period of time after the
request is duly filed with the city, taking into account the nature and scope
of the request, and any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
   (C)   Should the application of this subchapter have the effect of
prohibiting a person or entity from providing commercial personal wireless
service to all or a portion of the city, such provider may petition the city
for an amendment to this subchapter. The city, upon receipt of such a petition,
shall promptly undertake review of the petition pursuant to the standard
procedure for amendment of this chapter in accordance with state law and city
ordinances, and shall make a determination on the petition within a reasonable

§ 156.577 POLICY STATEMENT.
   (A)   The Planning Commission and City Council have on occasion and with
increasing frequency received requests to site communications towers and
antennas. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general guidelines for
the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this subchapter are to:
      (1)   Encourage the location of towers on public property and in non-
residential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the
city;
      (2)   Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sties;
      (3)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal;
      (4)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
      (5)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services throughout the city quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
   (B)   Accordingly, the City Council finds that the promulgation of this
subchapter is warranted and necessary:
      (1)   To manage the location of towers and antennas in the city and
encourage the use of public property for the placement thereof;
      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers, including support structure failure and falling ice;
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful
design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
      (4)   To accommodate the growing need for towers;
      (5)   To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new
towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers, and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future;
      (6)   To consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent
allowed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, being Pub. L. No. 104-104, or
its successor statute; and
      (7)   To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna
support structure failure and falling ice, through engineering and proper
siting of antenna support structure.
   (C)   All new antennas shall comply with this subchapter after the date of
passage.
   (D)   All towers existing on the date of passage of this subchapter shall be
allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance
shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction other than routine
maintenance on existing towers shall comply with the requirements of this
subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.030)
§ 156.578 INDUSTRY SITE SELECTION CRITERIA.
   (A)   In siting a new antenna, the industry requires a location that is
technically compatible with the established network. A general area is to be
identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service.
   (B)   Specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using
the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority:
      (1)   Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum
efficiency in telephone service;
      (2)   Availability of road access;
      (3)   Availability of electric power;
      (4)   Availability of land-based telephone lines or microwave link
capability;
      (5)   Leasable lands, and landlords who want facilities to be located on
their properties consistent with zoning regulations;
      (6)   Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and
topographic features;
      (7)   Zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities;
      (8)   Compatibility with adjacent land uses;
      (9)   The least number of sites to cover the desired area;
      (10)   The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical
requirements;
      (11)   Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact; and
      (12)   Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.040)
§ 156.579 CITY SITE SELECTION CRITERIA.
   (A)   As a fundamental element of this subchapter, the telecommunications
company proposing to construct an antenna support structure, or mount an
antenna on an existing structure, is required to demonstrate, using
technological evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order
to satisfy its function in the company’s grid system. Further, the company must
demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum
height necessary to fulfill the cell site’s function within the grid system.
   (B)   Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the
applicant demonstrates that it is either an FCC licensed telecommunications
provider or has in place agreements with an FCC licensed telecommunications
provider for use or lease of the support structure.
   (C)   Low power mobile radio service facilities should be located and
designed to minimize any adverse effect they may have on residential property
values. Sites should be placed in locations where the existing topography,
vegetation, buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of
screening. Sites should be located on bare ground without visual mitigation
only in M-D and M-G Districts, based on the design standards articulated in
this subchapter.
   (D)   Location and design of sites in all districts should consider the
impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within
the zone district. In residential districts and residential land use areas, the
minimum lot size for commercial communications towers shall be three acres.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.050)
§ 156.580 PRIORITIES.
   (A)   (1)   The following establishes the order of priorities for locating
new communications facilities:
         (a)   Place antennas and towers on public property;
         (b)   Place antennas and towers in districts zoned M-D or M-G;
         (c)   Place antennas and towers in districts zoned GC which do not
adjoin or adversely impact residential neighborhoods;
         (d)   Place antennas on appropriate existing structures, such as
buildings, communications towers, water towers and smokestacks in other zoned
districts;
         (e)   Place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential
property; and
         (f)   Place antennas and towers in:
            1.   Residential districts only if the installation is a small cell
facility, or locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available
on existing structures or in nonresidential districts; and
            2.   Only on or in existing churches, parks, schools, utility
facilities or other public facilities.
      (2)   An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a
residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been
made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government
structure, a private institutional structure or other appropriate existing
structures within a non-residential zoning district, and that due to valid
considerations including physical constraints, and economic or technological
feasibility, no appropriate location is available. The telecommunications
company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures within a one-mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission
to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for reasons other
than economic ones. The information submitted by the applicant shall include a
map of the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna
sites in the applicant’s network, and an evaluation of existing buildings
taller than 20 feet, communications towers and water tanks within one mile of
the proposed tower. The requirements in this division (A)(2) do not apply to a
small cell network or facility.
   (B)   Priority for the use of city-owned land for antennas and towers will
be given to the following entities in descending order:
      (1)   City of Brigham City;
      (2)   Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and
ambulance services, which are not part of the city and private entities with a
public safety agreement with the city;
      (3)   Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to
public safety; and
      (4)   Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication
services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized
mobilized raid (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized raid (ESMR), paging and
similar services that are marketed to the general public.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.060) (Ord. 14-14, passed 11-6-2014)
§ 156.581 USE OF CITY OWNED PROPERTY.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. The placement of antennas or towers on city-
owned property, including power and/or light poles, must comply with the
following requirements.
      (1)   The antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which
the city-owned property is intended.
      (2)   The antennas or tower will have no adverse impact on surrounding
private property.
      (3)   The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and
commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use
of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. Fees shall be
established by the City Council after considering comparable rates in other
cities, potential expenses, risks to the city and other appropriate factors.
      (4)   The applicant will submit a letter of credit, performance bond, or
other security acceptable to the city to cover the costs of antenna or tower’s
removal.
      (5)   The antennas or tower will not interfere with other users who have
a higher priority as outlined above.
      (6)   Upon reasonable notice, the antennas or tower may be required to be
removed at the antenna owner’s expense.
      (7)   The applicant must reimburse the city for any costs which the city
incurs because of the presence of the applicant’s antennas or tower.
      (8)   The applicant must obtain all necessary land use approvals.
      (9)   The applicant will cooperate with the city’s objective to promote
co-locations and thus limit the number of separate antenna sites requested
unless co-location is demonstrated to be infeasible or otherwise not in the
best interest of the city. The number of separate antennas in small cell
networks need not be limited so long as the small cell network meets the
concentration standards provided in §
156.583(B)(5) of this chapter.
   (B)   Special requirements. The use of certain city-owned property, such as
water tower sites and parks, for antennas or towers brings with it special
concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of antennas or
towers on these special city-owned sites will be allowed only when the
following additional requirements are met.
      (1)   Water tower or reservoir sites. The city’s water towers and
reservoirs represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization
and peak capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of the city’s water
supply is of prime importance to the city. As access to the city’s water
storage systems increase so too the potential for contamination of the public
water supply is increased. For these reasons, the placement of antennas or
towers on water tower or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the city is
fully satisfied that the following requirements are met.
         (a)   The applicant’s access to the facility will not increase the
risks of contamination to the city’s water supply.
         (b)   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds
to accommodate the applicant’s facility.
         (c)   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower
or reservoir maintenance cost to the city.
         (d)   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health
of workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
      (2)   Parks. The presence of certain antennas or towers represent a
potential conflict with the purpose of some city-owned parks. In no case shall
towers be allowed in designated conservation areas unless they are to be
installed in areas which currently contain tower facilities. Antennas or towers
will be considered only in the following parks after the recommendation of the
Planning Commission and approval of the City Council:
         (a)   Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are
adjacent to an existing commercial or industrial use;
         (b)   Commercial recreation areas and major play field; and
         (c)   Park maintenance facilities.
      (3)   Power poles and/or light poles. The city owns and operates an
electrical utility. As a public power provider, the city necessarily owns and
manages a substantial number of poles. This inventory of poles represents a
significant investment on the part of the city for the purpose of deploying a
system that delivers an essential electrical service to its resident’s and
customer’s primary considerations in the use of these poles includes safety and
security of city personnel, efficient and effective operation of the city’s
electrical utility, and the provision of electrical service to the city’s
residents and customers. city-owned power and/or light poles also provide
access for telephone services, telecommunications services and cable television
services. Attachment of antennas to city-owned power and/or light poles will be
allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that the following requirements
are met.
         (a)   The attached antenna is a small cell facility.
         (b)   The applicant’s attachment of an antenna to the pole will not
increase the risk of harm or injury to city staff or personnel of other users
of the pole.
         (c)   The applicant’s attachment of an antenna to the pole will not
harm the city’s ability to provide electrical service to its residents and
customers.
         (d)   There is sufficient room on the pole to accommodate the
applicant’s facility.
         (e)   The presence of the facility will not increase the electrical
utility’s maintenance cost to the city.
         (f)   The presence of the facility will not interfere with other
valid, existing pole attachments.
         (g)   The applicant has entered into a pole attachment agreement with
the city.
         (h)   The applicant has obtained a franchise agreement with the city,
if applicable.
   (C)   Application process. All applicants who wish to locate an antenna or
tower on city-owned property must submit to the Community Development
Department a complete application and detailed plan that complies with the
submittal requirements of this subchapter, this chapter,
Chapter 155 of this code of ordinances, General Plan and other regulations and
ordinances of the city along with other pertinent information requested by the
city. Small cell facilities may be considered for attachment on city-owned
power and/or light poles subject to execution of an appropriate pole attachment
agreement.
   (D)   Termination.
      (1)   The City Council may terminate any lease if it determines that any
one of the following conditions exist:
         (a)   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another
adequate location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing
use;
         (b)   A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other
users of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or
         (c)   A user violates any of the standards in this subchapter or the
conditions attached to the city’s lease, pole attachment or other
authorization.
      (2)   Before taking action, the city will provide notice to the user of
the intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for
the user to address the City Council regarding the proposed action. This
procedure need not be followed in emergency situations.
   (E)   Reservation of right. Notwithstanding the above, the City Council
reserves the right to deny, for any reason, the use of any or all city-owned
property, including power and/or light poles, by anyone or all applicants.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.065) (Ord. 14-14, passed 11-6-2014; Ord. 16-01, passed 1-
21-2016)
§ 156.582 CO-LOCATION; USE OF PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of
towers, co-location of antennas by more than one carrier on existing or new
towers and location of such antennas on public property shall take precedent
over the construction of new single-use towers as follows:
   (A)   Proposed antenna may, and are encouraged to, co-locate onto existing
towers; provided, such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with
the policy, design criteria and landscape/screening provisions contained in
this subchapter, then such co-locations are permitted by right and new or
additional special use approval is not required; except that, any other permit,
license, lease or franchise requirements must be satisfied.
   (B)   The conditional use requirement for an antenna may be waived in
nonresidential zones if the applicant locates the antenna on an existing
structure other than an existing tower and/or if the antenna is proposed to be
located on suitable public property such as a water tower, government building
or other public tower or pole. Suitability of public property shall be
determined at the city’s sole discretion. The applicant must submit detailed
plans to the Community Development Department for an administrative review to
determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be
waived. No building permit will be issued until approval is granted through the
administrative review.
   (C)   The city may deny the application to construct a new tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing
structure and/or public property.
   (D)   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in
the city in the future, any new proposed support structure shall be designed to
accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates
why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.
   (E)   Unless co-location has been demonstrated to be infeasible, the site
plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to be used for the
placement of additional equipment buildings for other users. The site plan for
towers in excess of 100 feet must propose space for two comparable tower users
while the site plan for towers under 100 feet must propose space for one
comparable tower user. To provide further incentive for co-location as a
primary option, an existing tower may be modified or reconstructed to
accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna; provided, the additional
antenna shall be of the same type as that on the existing tower. This is
permitted by right for existing towers in all zoning districts, subject to the
following criteria being met.
      (1)   Height. An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed 20 feet over the tower’s existing height, to accommodate
the co-location of an additional antenna. The height change may occur only once
per tower.
      (2)   On-site location. A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
co-location of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within 50 feet of its
existing location so long as it remains within the same zone and complies with
the other provisions of this subchapter. After the tower is rebuilt to co-
location, only one tower may remain on site.
(Prior Code, § 29.32.070)
§ 156.583 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   General. As provided above, new towers shall be designed to
accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates
why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.
   (B)   Compatibility. Facilities should be architecturally compatible with
the surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
      (1)   Setback. Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. Unless there
are unusual geographical limitations as determined in the city’s sole
discretion, in residential districts and residential land use areas, where
permitted, towers shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to
300% of tower height as measured from ground level. Towers shall comply with
the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they are located in all
other zoning districts.
      (2)   Color. Towers shall have a color generally matching the
surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different
color is required by the FCC or FAA.
      (3)   Lights, signals and signs. No signals, lights or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be
required, at the time of construction of the tower in cases where there are
residential users located within a distance which 300% of the height of the
tower from the tower, then dual mode lighting shall be required from the FAA.
      (4)   Equipment structures.
         (a)   Ground level equipment and buildings and the tower base shall be
screened from public streets and residentially zoned properties. The standards
for the equipment buildings are as follows.
            1.   The maximum floor area is 300 feet and the maximum height is
12 feet.
            2.   Ground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent
properties by landscape plantings, fencing or other appropriate means, as
specified herein or in the city code.
            3.   Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish
similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof-mounted antenna may
also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.
         (b)   Equipment buildings, antenna and related equipment shall occupy
no more than 25% of the total roof area of a building.
         (c)   Antenna or equipment buildings not meeting these standards
require a special exception. The use must be approved on a comprehensive sketch
plan or final development plan, as applicable.
      (5)   Concentration of small cell facilities. In order to avoid excessive
concentration of small cell facilities on city-owned power and/or light poles,
such facilities shall be located no closer than 500 feet to any other small
cell facility in the same small cell network; provided that, small cell
networks approved through a conditional use permit may include more highly
concentrated small cell facilities when the applicant demonstrates that the
proposed locations are needed to adequately serve the coverage area.
   (C)   Federal requirements. All towers and antennas, including small cell
facilities, must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA,
the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to
regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed,
then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this subchapter shall
bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations within three months of the effective date of such standards and
regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the
controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds
for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners’ expense.
   (D)   Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable city building codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association (“EIA”), as amended from time to time.
      (1)   If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner
shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
      (2)   If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said
30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner’s expense.
   (E)   Structural design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards,
which may be amended from time to time, and all applicable construction/
building codes. Further, any improvements and/or additions to existing towers
shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional
engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA Standards and all other good
industry practices in effect at the time of said improvement or addition. Said
plans shall be submitted to and reviewed at the time building permits are
required.
   (F)   Fencing. A well-constructed masonry or stone wall in all zones, except
M-D, M-G, MU-40, MU-80 or MU-160, or chain link in M-D, M-G, MU-40, MU-80 or
MU-160 zones, not less than eight feet in height from finished grade shall be
provided around each tower. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate.
   (G)   Antenna height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is
the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No antenna that is
taller than this minimum height shall be approved.
   (H)   Antenna support structure safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that
the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas
will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice or
other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-
climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.
   (I)   Required parking. If the cell site is fully automated, adequate
parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the site is not
automated, arrangements for adequate off-street parking shall be made and
documentation thereof provided to the city. Security fencing should be colored
or should be of a design which blends into the character of the existing
environment.
   (J)   Antenna criteria. Antennas on or above a building shall be subject to
the following.
      (1)   The antenna must be architecturally compatible with the building
and wall on which it is mounted and designed and located so as to minimize any
adverse aesthetic impact.
      (2)   The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in a
configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not
project above the wall on which it is mounted unless for technical reasons the
antenna needs to project above the roof line. In no event shall an antenna
project more than ten feet above the roof line.
      (3)   The antenna shall be constructed, painted or fully screened to
match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on
which it is mounted.
      (4)   The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical
equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not
project any higher than the enclosure.
      (5)   If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend with
the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color.
      (6)   The structure must be architecturally and visually (color, size,
bulk) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation
and/or uses or those likely to exist under the terms of the underlying zoning.
Such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if
they are camouflaged to disguise the facility.
      (7)   Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing
character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be
preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site
should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact
of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation
techniques must be evaluated by city, in city’s sole discretion, taking into
consideration the site as built.
      (8)   On buildings 30 feet or less in height, the antenna may be mounted
on the roof it:
         (a)   The city finds that it is not technically possible or
aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall;
         (b)   No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of
the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein;
         (c)   The antenna or antennas and related base stations cover no more
than an aggregate total of 25% of the roof area of a building;
         (d)   Roof-mounted antenna and related base stations are completely
screened from view by materials that are consistent and compatible with the
design, color and materials of the building; and
         (e)   No portion of the antenna may exceed ten feet above the height
of the existing building.
      (9)   If a proposed antenna is located on a building or a lot subject to
a site review, approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit.
      (10)   No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an
individual landmark or as a part of a historic district, unless such antenna
has been approved in accordance with the city code.
      (11)   No antenna owner or lessee or officer or employee thereof shall
fail to cooperate in good faith to accommodate other competitors in their
attempts to use the same building for other antennas. If a dispute arises about
the feasibility of accommodating another competitor, the City Administrator may
require a third-party technical study, at the expense of either or both
parties, to resolve the dispute.
      (12)   No antenna owner or lessee shall fail to assure that the antenna
complies at all times with the then current applicable American National
Standards Institute or FCC standards, whichever is more stringent. After
installation, but prior to putting the antenna in service, each antenna owner
shall provide a certification by an independent professional engineer to that
effect.
      (13)   No antenna shall cause localized interference with the reception
of any other communications signals including, but not limited to, public
safety signals, and television and radio broadcast signals.
      (14)   No person shall locate an antenna or tower upon any lot or parcel
except as provided in this subchapter.

   (A)   Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to screen as much
of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding the support
structure and any other ground level features (such as a building), and in
general soften the appearance of the cell site. The city may permit any
combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or
other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of
screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an
existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure,
or if the antenna is part of a small cell network, landscaping shall not be
required.
   (B)   The visual impacts of a tower shall be mitigated through landscaping
or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures.
The following landscaping and buffering of towers shall be required around the
perimeter of the tower and accessory structures; except that, the standards may
be waived by the city for those sides of the proposed tower that are located
adjacent to undevelopable lands and lands not in public view. Landscaping shall
be installed on the outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be
preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for
or in supplement towards meeting landscaping requirements.
      (1)   A row of evergreen trees a minimum of ten feet tall at planting a
maximum of six feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence.
      (2)   A continuous hedge at least 36 inches high at planting capable of

   (A)   In the event the use of any tower or small cell facility has been
discontinued for a period of 60 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to
be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the
city which shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from
the tower or small cell facility owner/operator regarding the issue of tower
usage.
   (B)   Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an
additional 60 days within which to:
      (1)   Reactivate the use of the tower or small cell facility or transfer
the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower or small
cell facility; or
      (2)   (a)   Dismantle and remove the tower or small cell facility. If
such tower or small cell facility is not removed within said 60 days, the city
may remove such tower or small cell facility at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   If there are two or more users of a single tower or small cell
facility, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
using the tower.
