1-6-3: MEETINGS, PROCEDURE AND CONDUCT; VOTING:
   A.   Regular Meetings:
      1.   The city council shall hold two (2) regular meetings which shall be
held on the first and third Tuesday of each month at the city offices.
      2.   The meetings held on the dates specified in the foregoing subsection
shall begin promptly at six thirty o'clock (6:30) P.M.; provided, that:
         a.   If the meeting date is a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be
held at the same time and place above described on the next following day which
is not a legal holiday.
         b.   The city council may, by resolution, provide for a different time
and place for holding regular meetings of the city council.
         c.   The mayor, with the consent of a majority of the city council is
needed to cancel any regular city council meeting.
   B.   Special Meetings: If at any time the business of the city requires a
special meeting of the city council, such meeting may be ordered by the mayor
or any two (2) members of the city council. The order shall be entered in the
minutes of the city council. The order shall provide at least three (3) hours'
notice of the special meeting and notice thereof shall be served by the city
recorder on each council member who did not sign the order by delivering the
notice personally or by leaving it at the council member's usual place of
abode. The personal appearance by a council member at any specially called
meeting constitutes a waiver of the notice required in this section.
   C.   Emergency Meetings: When, because of unforeseen circumstances, it is
necessary for the city council to hold an emergency meeting to consider matters
of an emergency or urgent nature, the notice requirements contained in
subsection F of this section may be disregarded and the best notice practicable
given, but not less than three (3) hours' notice. No such emergency meeting of
the city council shall be held unless an attempt has been made to notify all of
the council members and a majority votes in the affirmative to hold the
meeting. (Ord. 2012-02, 4-3-2012)
   D.   Work Meetings: A work meeting may be scheduled by any member of the
council with the consent of two (2) other members of the council (mayor
included).
      1.   Work meetings can serve the purpose of discussion or study of any
item deemed necessary by those calling said meeting.
      2.   After discussion at a work meeting, items will be referred:
         a.   To a future work meeting if the matter needs further work by the
council; or
         b.   To a future regular council meeting to be considered as council
business or, if the matter is ready for final action, to the consent agenda.
      3.   Generally, no action will be taken on items discussed at a work
meeting; however, the council may make an exception and suspend its rules to
vote on matters under discussion if three (3) or more of the council members in
attendance vote to suspend the rules.
      4.   During a work meeting the council members and the mayor may sit
around a conference table, rather than at the dais, to provide a more informal
atmosphere and to allow a freer exchange of ideas. (Ord. 2016-01, 3-1-2016)
   E.   Open Meetings: Every meeting is open to the public, unless closed
pursuant to Utah Code Annotated sections 52-4-204 and 52-4-205, governing
closed meetings.
   F.   Notice Of Meetings: At least once each year, the city council shall
give notice of its annual meeting schedule, specifying the date, time and place
of such meeting. The city council shall give reasonable notice of the agenda,
date, time and place of each of its meetings. This public notice shall be given
at least four (4) days prior to any meeting and shall be given by posting
written notice at the Sunset City hall, and by providing notice to at least one
newspaper of general circulation within the city limits, or to a local media
correspondent.
   G.   Quorum: The majority of the city council shall constitute a quorum to
do business, but a smaller number may adjourn from time to time and are hereby
empowered to compel the attendance of an absent member. Should any member of
the city council, when notified by the chief of police or other authority that
his presence is necessary to form a quorum (unless he shall present an excuse
satisfactory to the city council at its next regular meeting), or should any
member leave the council meeting while in session without the consent of the
city council when such leaving would break the quorum, may be fined in any sum
not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00).
   H.   City Council Meeting Agenda: All meetings of the city council will have
a notice and agenda that complies with the Utah open meetings act. An item may
be placed on the agenda by the mayor, city manager (administrator), or at the
request of any council member. Agenda items must be submitted to the city
recorder at least five (5) days before the date of the meeting. Any item that
is submitted to the city recorder after that time will be put on the next
following meeting agenda. The city recorder shall notify the mayor of the added
agenda item.
   I.   Rules Of Proceedings: The city council shall determine its own rules of
proceedings and may punish its members for disorderly conduct with the
concurrence of at least three (3) members of the city council.
      1.   Role Of The Mayor As Chair And Others At Council Meetings: The mayor
shall preside at meetings of the city council and participate in discussion of
all matters. The mayor shall vote as a member thereof only in case of a tie or
where otherwise specifically authorized to do so by state law, and shall have
no power to veto. In addition, the mayor, as the chair, has the primary
responsibility for ensuring that the council's rules of procedure are followed
and for maintaining the dignity of council meetings. The mayor calls the
meeting to order and confines the discussion to the agenda. The mayor
recognizes council members for motions and statements and may allow audience
and staff participation at appropriate times. The council requires the mayor to
have knowledge of the city's adopted rules of parliamentary procedure and how
to apply it. The mayor is to ensure that the Utah open and public meetings act
is complied with. The mayor should know how to courteously ensure those who
have the floor are not interrupted and to rule out of order those not following
meeting procedures. The mayor will recognize the council member offering the
motion, restate the motion, ask for a second and, if a second is granted, the
mayor shall present it to the council for consideration. There can be up to
three (3) motions on the floor at the same time and no more than three (3). The
mayor can reject a fourth motion until the mayor has dealt with the three (3)
that are on the floor and has resolved them. Then the mayor calls for the vote,
announces the vote, then announces the next order of business.
         a.   Procedure: When there are two (2) or three (3) motions on the
floor (after motions and seconds) at the same time, the vote should proceed
first on the last motion that is made. So, for example, assume the first motion
is a basic "motion to adopt ordinance 10-1". During the discussion of this
motion, a member might make a second motion to "amend the main motion to adopt
ordinance 10-1 with changes in paragraph 1 as follows...". And perhaps, during
that discussion, a member makes yet a third motion as a "substitute motion that
we refer the matter to the planning commission". The proper procedure would be
as follows:
First, the mayor would deal with the third (the last) motion on the floor, the
substitute motion. After discussion and debate, a vote would be taken first on
the third motion. If the substitute motion passed, it would be a substitute for
the basic motion and would eliminate it. The first motion would be moot, as
would the second motion (which sought to amend the first motion), and the
action on the agenda item would be completed on the passage by the city council
of the third motion (the substitute motion). No vote would be taken on the
first or second motions. On the other hand, if the substitute motion (the third
motion) failed then the mayor would proceed to consideration of the second
(now, the last) motion on the floor, the motion to amend.
Second, if the substitute motion failed, the mayor would now deal with the
second (now, the last) motion on the floor, the motion to amend. The discussion
and debate would focus strictly on the amendment. If the motion to amend passed
the mayor would now move to consider the main motion (the first motion) as
amended. If the motion to amend failed the mayor would now move to consider the
main motion (the first motion) in its original format, not amended.
Third, the mayor would now deal with the first motion that was placed on the
floor. The original motion would either be in its original format, or, if
amended, would be in its amended format.
   J.   Public Comment: There shall be on every agenda of the city council an
item entitled "public comment". The public comment portion of the meeting shall
be limited to the public speaking to the council on any item. Members of the
public shall be free to express any idea, question, or viewpoint without
limitation except for time and the manner of the presentation. Individual
members of the public shall be limited to three (3) minutes' time. The chair of
the meeting shall ensure that the public comment is civil and orderly. The
chair shall use its best efforts to allow the free expression of the public and
keep the meeting in order. Council members should not interrupt, argue with, or
otherwise interfere with any comment by a member of the public. The mayor and
city council may ask clarifying questions of the member of the public making a
presentation and other members of the public may ask clarifying questions of
the presenter at the discretion of the chair. (Ord. 2012-02, 4-3-2012)
   K.   Council Member Participation: At regular meetings of the city council,
council members shall speak only after being recognized by the mayor/chair. Any
meeting designated as a work meeting shall be more informal and council members
may freely participate as long as proper decorum is maintained. Council members
shall conduct themselves at all times with decorum and respect. They shall
refrain from making any disparaging remarks concerning any other member of the
governing body or the public. Any member of the council wishing to speak on any
item on the agenda shall be recognized by the mayor/chair to do so. The member
will be allowed to speak uninterrupted until they have yielded the floor back
to the mayor/chair.
      1.   Exception: A member of the council may call out a point of order if
he or she feels the point has been made and no further comments need to be made
by the speaker. After the point of order is recognized by the mayor/chair, the
member will make a motion to limit the speaker's comments to a one minute
closing statement. A second and a majority vote would close the member's
statements after one minute. This will in no way hinder the member's ability to
speak later on the item if additional information is disclosed. (Ord. 2017-01,
1-17-2017)
   L.   Meeting Adjournment: Meetings of the city council, as a goal, shall be
scheduled to end at or before ten o'clock (10:00) P.M. and the mayor and city
council shall use their best efforts to conclude the meeting in a timely
manner. However, no motion to extend the time of the meeting is necessary to be
made. The meetings of the city council shall not be adjourned until all items
listed on the agenda have been acted upon and a motion to adjourn is made and
approved by a majority of the city council.
   M.   Voting:
      1.   Vote Taken: A vote shall be taken upon all ordinances and all
propositions creating any liability against the city, and in all other cases at
the request of any member of the city council, which vote shall be entered in
the minutes of the meeting. The concurrence of a majority of the members of the
city council elected or legally appointed shall be necessary to the passage of
any ordinance or proposition creating any liability against the city. Where
there is an even number of council members present, the consent or concurrence
of three (3) of the council members shall be sufficient to confirm an
appointment or concur in the removal of an appointive officer.
      2.   Reconsideration Of Votes: No vote of the city council shall be
reconsidered or rescinded in any special meeting, unless at such special
meeting there is present as large a number of council members as were present
when such vote was taken.

1-14-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for the city to
assist the city in identifying actions that involve physical taking or exaction
of private real property that may have constitutional taking issues. (Ord.
2003-02, 2-18-2003)
1-14-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used herein:
   CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUES: Actions involving the physical or regulatory
taking of private real property by the city that might require compensation to
a private real property owner under:
   A.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United
States;
   B.   Article I, section 22 of the Utah constitution; or
   C.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of
private real property by a governmental entity. (Ord. 2003-02, 2-18-2003)
1-14-3: GUIDELINES:
The following guidelines shall be considered by the city when taking any action
that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real
property:
   A.   Identification: The city should review the following to determine and
identify whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking
issues:
      1.   Does the action result in a permanent physical occupation of private
property?
      2.   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or
grant an easement to the city?
      3.   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically
viable uses of the property?
      4.   Does the action have a severe impact on the property owner's
economic interest?
      5.   Does the action deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?
   B.   Analysis: If the city determines that a governmental action involves
constitutional taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed by the
city to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken. In
reviewing the proposed action, the following factors may be analyzed:
      1.   The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of
the private property;
      2.   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional
taking;
      3.   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the
city's lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;
      4.   The cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined;
      5.   The governmental interest involved and its nexus to the potential
taking; and
      6.   If the action is roughly proportionate or reasonably related to the
impact of any proposed development.
   C.   Appeals: Any owner of private property whose interest in the property
is subject to a physical or regulatory taking by the city, pursuant to a final
and authoritative decision or action of the city, may appeal the city's
decision or action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the
grounds for the appeal in the city recorder's office within thirty (30) days
from the date of the city's decision or action. The city council or its
designee shall hear all evidence regarding the appeal and render its decision
and findings in writing within fourteen (14) days from the date the appeal was
filed. If the city fails to hear and decide the appeal within fourteen (14)
days, the city's decision or action is presumed to be approved.
   D.   Limitations: The guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and
shall not be construed to expand nor limit the scope of the city's liability
for a constitutional taking. The city shall have no legal liability to any
person, firm or entity of any nature whatsoever and a court may not impose
liability upon the city for failure to comply with the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 2003-02, 2-18-2003)

officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and
property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens
regarding door to door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement
officers and those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as
well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional

timely manner; or

in the business and social life of the city;
         b.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
         c.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic
well-being of the city and its citizens; and
         d.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
      2.   Findings Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
      3.   Findings Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
      4.   Findings Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The
city finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to
promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a
nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to
assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.
      5.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
         a.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
         b.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
         c.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm
that may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
         d.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority
of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
         e.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the city infrastructure;
         f.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
         g.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("Act") (PL no. 96-104).
      6.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts this
telecommunications ordinance pursuant to its power to manage the rights of way,
pursuant to common law, the Utah constitution and statutory authority, and
receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights of way by
providers as expressly set forth by section 253 of the act.
   B.   Scope: This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers
of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of the right of
way, including providers of both the system and service, those providers of the
system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only
provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all
providers in the city prior to the effective date hereof, whether operating
with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection
7-5-12B of this chapter.

chapter through the exercise of the city's police power and not preempted by
other law shall be applicable. (Ord. 2000-05, 9-5-2000)

   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The city is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and
maintenance of systems in the city's rights of way, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider.
   B.   Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal
or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
(Ord. 2000-05, 9-5-2000)
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purpose and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or
subleased, except as may be expressly provided in the franchise agreement. A
franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole
attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others,
including the city's property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit
a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has
obtained a franchise. (Ord. 2000-07, 11-17-2000)
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by federal or state
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date hereof shall
request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the
effective date hereof. If such request is made, the provider may continue
providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not
made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider
shall comply with the provisions of subsection
7-5-9D of this chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2000-05, 9-5-2000)
7-5-4: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider may be required to pay the city, at the time of
application, five hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
      2.   Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or
business license tax enacted by the city.
      3.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in chapter 3 of this title.
   B.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month.
   C.   Fee Statement And Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy.
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise, provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
arbitration association. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
power and public works department to provide space on city-owned poles shall be
borne by the provider.
   E.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
   F.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
   G.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
   H.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in
this chapter or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city-owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   I.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation,
provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation
after the term including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
   J.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 2000-05, 9-5-
2000; amd. Ord. 2022-01, 4-5-2022)

application form as amended, is incorporated by reference.
   B.   Application Criteria: In making a determination as to an application
filed pursuant to this chapter, the city may, but shall not be limited to,
request the following from the provider:
      1.   A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of
convenience and necessity, if any is necessary for provider's offering of
services within the state of Utah.
      2.   Certification of the provider's financial ability to compensate the
city for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights of way during
the franchise term proposed by the provider.
      3.   Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of section
7-5-6 of this chapter.
   C.   Franchise Determination: The city, in its discretion, shall determine
the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations
relevant to the use of the rights of way, without competitive bidding. (Ord.
2000-05, 9-5-2000)
7-5-6: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing
construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any
other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the city or the
franchise, including requirements regarding locating and sharing in the cost of
locating portions of the system with other systems or with city utilities. A
provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to the excavation
ordinance 1 , before commencing any work in the rights of way.
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,
it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by federal
law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system
including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or
within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the city to use private property, easements,
poles and conduit. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,
approval or authorization including, but not limited to, excavation permits,
pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
   D.   Relocation Of The System:
      1.   New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights of way are
changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall
comply with the requirements of the excavation ordinance.
      2.   The City Authority To Move System In Case Of An Emergency: The city
may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined
by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system
and appurtenances on, over or under the rights of way of the city, in which
event the city shall not be liable therefore to a provider. The city shall
notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon
as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any
action taken under this section. Notice shall be given as provided in
subsection

provider shall, upon prior reasonable written notice by the city or any person
holding a permit to move any structure, and within the time that is reasonable
under the circumstances, temporarily move any part of its system to permit the
moving of said structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any
person other than the city for any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Rights Of Way Change; Obligation To Move System: When the city is
changing a rights of way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the rights of way, without cost to the city, to
the extent provided in the excavation ordinance 2 . This obligation does not
apply to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights of way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
   E.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city and all
designated landmarks, as well as all other structures within any designated
landmark district. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the
city to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or
any other municipal structure on, over or under the rights of way of the city
required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be
made by the city or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees
that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair
and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified
by the city, and municipal structure or any other rights of way of the city
involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the
system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by
or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   F.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably
obstruct the rights of way of fixed guide- way systems, railways, passenger
travel, or other traffic to, from or within the city without the prior consent
of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local requirements including, but not
limited to, the national electrical safety code.
   H.   Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the city, imminent danger exists, any rights of way
within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights of way intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof.

representative of the city of the system and its effect on the rights of way.
   J.   Trimming Of Trees: A provider shall have the authority to trim trees,
in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights of way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. (Ord. 2000-05, 9-5-2000)

city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records, provided that the city shall not audit
the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city shall not
be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is later

conflict with such law, the provision in question shall return to full force
and effect and shall again be binding on the city and the provider, provided

time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a
rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance
with such provision.

8-4-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
   APPROVED BACKFLOW ASSEMBLY: An assembly accepted by the department of
environmental quality, division of drinking water, as meeting an applicable
specification or as suitable for the proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the city's public water supply will be considered an auxiliary water
supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another supplier's public
potable water supply from any natural source such as a well, spring, river,
stream, harbor, used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be
contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an
unacceptable water source over which the supplier does not have authority for
purposes of sanitary control.
   BACK PRESSURE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
under pressure into the feeding distribution pipes of a potable water supply
system from any source other than the intended source.
   BACK SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
into the distribution pipes of a potable water system from any source other
than the intended source caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable
water supply system.
   BACKFLOW: The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphonage. It is controlled if it is the subject of a proper
backflow assembly approved by the department of environmental quality, division
of drinking water, as meeting applicable specifications or as suitable for a
proposed use. Specifications are as set forth in the Utah plumbing code 1 .
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly or means designed to prevent
backflow as the same are set forth within the Utah plumbing code and the cross
connection control program for Utah.
   CONTAMINATION: A degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by
sewage, industrial fluids, waste liquids, compounds or other materials.
   CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other
material of questionable quality to come in contact with potable water inside a
distribution system. This would include any temporary connection such as swing
connectors, removable sections, four (4) way plug valves, spools, dummy
sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding multi-arrangements.
It is controlled if it has an approved backflow prevention assembly properly
installed and maintained so it will continuously afford the protection
commensurate with the degree of hazard. This it must do. (Ord. 2-5-91, 2-5-
1991; 1997 Code)
 
Notes
1 1. See title 9, chapter 1 of this code.
8-4-3: INSTALLATION REQUIRED:
The installation of an approved backflow assembly shall be required at the
water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and
economically not feasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all
actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water system. The
installation of such a system shall be required on the service line leading to
and supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or
potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or
controlled at the point of cross-connection. (Ord. 2-5-91, 2-5-1991)
8-4-4: RESPONSIBILITY AND ENFORCEMENT:

supply is protected as required by the laws or regulations of the State, any
applicable code or this Chapter. Service of water to a consumer determined by
the City to be in violation of this Chapter may be discontinued by the City
after notice to the consumer and an opportunity to be heard is afforded within
ten (10) days of the date of the notice. The City may discontinue the service
if the consumer does not then respond or takes no action within ten (10) days
after it is determined by the administration upon a hearing or on its own if no
hearing is held that:
      1.   A backflow prevention assembly as required by this Chapter for
control of backflow or cross-connections is not installed, tested or not
working properly.
      2.   A backflow prevention assembly has been removed or by-passed.
      3.   The periodic system survey has not been conducted.
   B.   Restoration Of Service: Service will not be restored until the defects

City at all reasonable times.
   D.   Installation: Whenever the City shall find that a service connection's
water usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved
backflow prevention assembly shall be installed by the consumer on the service
line of his system at or near the property line or immediately inside the
building being served or in the meter box, but in all cases before the first
branch line leading off the service line. The type of assembly required shall
depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the point of cross-connection
whether direct or indirect and as the same may be governed by local and State
requirements or resulting from the required survey. It shall be tested within
ten (10) days after installation.
   E.   Present Systems: All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
which do not meet the requirements of this Chapter but were approved at
installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements herein provided for, be excluded from
the requirements hereunder so long as the City is assured that the public water
system is satisfactorily protected. Whenever an existing assembly is removed or
requires more than minimum maintenance or if the City finds that operation or
maintenance thereof constitutes a hazard to health as herein provided, the unit
shall be replaced with an approved assembly.
   F.   Testing: It shall be the responsibility of the consumer where
assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests
made at least once a year. Where the City deems any hazard to exist it may
require such test at more frequent intervals. All such tests shall be made
according to the standards of the Department of Environmental Quality, Division
of Drinking Water. No assembly shall be installed so as to create a safety
hazard within any building or in relation to any other service lines or systems
or equipment. (Ord. 2-5-91, 2-5-1991; 1997 Code)
   G.   Restoration: In the event service is terminated by the City and any
break has been made or has occurred in a service line, it shall be the
responsibility of the consumer or owner either to accomplish and pay for the
repair or to reimburse the City for all charges in connection therewith before
service is restored. (Ord. 2-5-91, 2-5-1991)

(Ord. 2012-03, 10-2-2012)
8-6-2: STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the city's storm drain
system, managing and controlling groundwater and stormwater runoff, protecting
property, improving water quality, preventing polluted waters from entering the
city's water supply and other receiving waters, providing for flood mitigation,
and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction,
operation and maintenance of the city's storm drain system and flood mitigation
projects.
   B.   Definitions: In addition to the definitions set forth in subsection
8-6-1I of this chapter, for the purposes of this section, the following terms,
phrases and words shall have the following meanings:
   DEVELOPED PARCEL: Any parcel that has been altered from its natural
condition by the construction of improvements or other impervious surface areas
or by grading or filling of the ground surface areas which grading or filling
affects the hydraulic properties of the parcel.
   EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNIT (ESU): The average amount of impervious surface,
expressed in square feet, on developed parcels in the city.
   PARCEL: The smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an
identified owner, boundaries, and surface area which is documented for tax
purposes and given a tax account (lot) number by the Davis County assessor.
   C.   Drainage Utility: The city council hereby creates and establishes a
drainage utility. The drainage utility shall plan, design, construct, maintain,
administer and operate the Sunset City's storm drain system.
   D.   Enterprise Fund: The city council hereby establishes a drainage utility
enterprise fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial transactions
related to the drainage utility. All drainage utility service charges shall be
deposited in the drainage utility enterprise fund. Money in the drainage
utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other
city funds. However, the drainage utility may pay other city funds for services
and expenses directly attributable to the drainage utility. The drainage
utility enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city
ordinances, rules, regulations and policies.
   E.   Facilities And Assets: The drainage utility shall operate independently
of city operations funded by the general fund. Upon creation of the utility,
all of the city's storm drain system, facilities and assets (other than streets
and other facilities and assets designated by the city council) shall be
transferred to the drainage utility in consideration for the drainage utility's
agreement to take primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing,
maintaining, administering and operating the city's storm drain system.
   F.   Fees:
      1.   Imposed: Each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be
charged a drainage utility fee.
      2.   ESU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service
units (ESUs) contained on the parcel. The city council finds that the ESU is
the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel
contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the drainage utility. Based
on a study completed within Sunset, the city council finds and establishes that
one ESU equals nine thousand (9,000) square feet of impervious surface area.
      3.   Calculation: The fees established herein are based upon studies
conducted by the city, or caused to be conducted by the city. Based on
collection data, the city council finds that each single-family residential
unit and residential duplex contributes approximately the same amount of
stormwater runoff; therefore, each developed single-family residential parcel
or residential duplex shall pay a base rate of one ESU. All developed multi-
family residential parcels, commercial parcels, and other nonresidential
parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate, expressed in ESUs, according to
the measured impervious area on the parcel.
      4.   Charge Per ESU: The amount charged for each ESU shall be established
by resolution of the city council and set forth in the city's fee schedule.
   G.   Billing: The city council finds that the city's storm drain system,
culinary water system and solid waste collection system are all interrelated
services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health, safety
and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible
manner. Therefore, the drainage utility fee shall be included on the city's
regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no regular
utility bill for the property, the drainage utility fee shall be charged to the
owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by
the person or entity paying the city utility service provided to the property.
All developed parcels shall be charged the fee, regardless of whether or not
the owner or occupant of the property requests the drainage utility service.
Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of
water service.
   H.   Exemptions: The following exemptions shall be provided regarding
required drainage utility fees:
      1.   Undeveloped Parcels: Undeveloped parcels shall not be required to
pay any drainage utility fees.
      2.   Streets: The city council finds that fully improved dedicated public
streets, constructed in compliance with city standards and specifications, are
part of the storm utility conveyance system and are therefore exempt from the
drainage utility fees set forth herein.
   I.   Credits:
      1.   Credits And Adjustments: The city acknowledges the need to provide
credits and adjustments to the drainage utility fees charged for various
developments as more particularly provided herein.
      2.   Residential Units: All single-family residential units and
residential duplexes have been assumed to be similar in terms of their impact
and contribution of stormwater runoff to the city's storm drainage systems. As
such, all single-family residential units and duplexes pay a common base user
fee and will not be considered for a user fee credit.
      3.   Multi-Family, Commercial And Industrial Developments: As there are
many varying site runoff conditions for multi-family, commercial, industrial,
institutional and other nonresidential developments, the city will consider
granting a reduction and/or credit to the calculated user fee for certain
parcels based upon detention, retention and/or mitigation management facilities
and/or measures provided on the parcel.
      4.   Amendments: The city council reserves the right to alter the
criteria on which credits are granted, based on the objectives of the drainage
utility program. The current primary object behind the credit policies set
forth herein is to encourage on site detention, retention and/or mitigation
measure in accordance with this chapter, the city's storm drain master plan and
stormwater management plan, and to address water quality.
      5.   Limitations: The credits provided herein are intended to encourage
property owners to implement on site stormwater management facilities and/or
best management practices to assist and improve the city's overall ability to
address stormwater management and water quality. The various types of credits
may be utilized alone or cumulatively to address such issues, provided the
maximum amount of credit that may be granted for any parcel or property shall
be seventy percent (70%) of the original calculated fee. In no event shall any
credit be granted that would reduce the minimum month storm drainage utility
fee below one ESU. No credit shall be imposed retroactively.
      6.   Application For Credit Or Adjustment: Any multi-family, commercial,
industrial or institutional property owner, or their agent, may apply to the
city administrator for a reduction in the monthly drainage utility fee. A
reduction in the monthly fee will be considered if one or more of the following
credit or adjustment criteria apply:
         a.   Adjustments:
            (1)   Adjustment criteria #1: Calculation of the impervious surface
area is incorrect.
               (A)   A great amount of time and effort has been expended in
analyzing and determining the measurement and calculation of the impervious
surface area for property within the city to ensure accuracy and correctness.
The impervious surface area for most properties is determined from site plans
on file with the city, aerial photos, and/or actual field measurements.
Property owners, or their agents, who disagree with the amount of impervious
surface area measured on their property may apply for an adjustment based on an
incorrect calculation of impervious surface. In order to receive an adjustment,
the property owner, or his or her agent, must provide sufficient evidence that
indicates that the amount of impervious surface has been miscalculated. This
information may include, but is not limited to, final site plans, as built
drawings, aerial photos, actual field measurements, and/or other documents that
indicate the impervious surface areas. All properties that are reevaluated by
the city will be billed according to the new measurements. This new billing may
result in a lower or higher fee applied to the property.
            (2)   Adjustment criteria #2: The amount of impervious surface area
on the property changes.
               (A)   There is a possibility that changes may occur in the
amount of impervious surface areas as a result of development or other
improvements to the property. If changes have been made on a parcel of land
that alters the amount of impervious surface area (e.g., new areas of
landscaping, or a reduction of impervious surface areas), the property owner,
or his or her agent, may apply for an adjustment. Supporting documentation must
accompany the application, including, but not limited to, final site plans, as
built drawings, aerial photos, actual field measurements, and/or other
documents that indicate the impervious surface areas. All properties that are
reevaluated by the city will be billed according to the new calculations. This
new billing may result in a lower or higher fee applied to the property.
         b.   Credits:
            (1)   Credit criteria #1: Property owner has constructed on site
stormwater retention or detention basin(s) which limit the stormwater discharge
rate and have a benefit to the overall system of the city, as determined by the
city.
               (A)   Many properties within the city have constructed retention
or detention areas on site. These retention or detention areas or basins help
control the amount of stormwater that enters into the city's system during and
after a storm event. Nonresidential property owners, or their agents, that have
constructed such on site stormwater retention or detention facilities may be
eligible to apply for credit. In order for a property to receive credit for
retention or detention capabilities on their site, the property owner, or their
agent, must provide detailed information about the retention or detention area.
This information shall include, but is not limited to: final site plans, as
built drawings, and blue prints, engineer's studies or reports, and/or drainage
calculations. In order to receive credit, it must be determined by the city
that the retention or detention facility has a sufficient benefit to the city's
overall storm drain system; that the retention or detention facility helps to
reduce the city's costs in operating and maintaining the city's storm drain
system; and/or that the retention or detention facility reduces downstream flow
or adds capacity or reduces the city's downstream costs in providing stormwater
services. The retention or detention facility must be inspected by the city to
determine that the system is in good working order as represented by the
applicant.
               (B)   If granted, the credit provided may remain in effect,
subject to amendment to this credit policy, as long as:
                  (i)   The retention or detention system is in working order
and properly maintained.
                  (ii)   The property owner remains responsible for all costs
of operation and maintenance of the facility.
                  (iii)   The city has access to the stormwater retention or
detention facility for the purpose of inspecting its compliance with design,
maintenance and operating standards.
                  (iv)   The retention or detention system continues to provide
a sufficient benefit to the city's overall storm drain system; helps to reduce
the city's costs in operating and maintaining the city's overall storm drain
system; and/or reduces downstream flow, adds capacity or reduces the city's
downstream costs in providing stormwater services, as determined by the city.
               (C)   The amount of credit, if any, for an on site stormwater
detention basin shall be determined by the city administrator, upon
recommendation by the review committee, as to the benefit of the facility and
the following table:
 
Basin Outlet Rate Maximum Credit Amount
0.8 cfs per acre  30%
0.6 cfs per acre  35%
0.4 cfs per acre  40%
0.2 cfs per acre  45%
 
               (D)   A maximum credit of up to fifty five percent (55%) may be
granted for on site retention facilities with a discharge of zero, as
determined by the city administrator, upon recommendation by the review
committee as to the benefits of the facility.
(2) Credit criteria #2: Property owner has constructed on site stormwater
detention that has the capacity to detain more water than the property
generates and is considered to be a regional detention facility by the city.
               (A)   A maximum credit of up to forty five percent (45%) may be
granted for on site stormwater detention facilities that have the capacity to
detain more water than the property generates and is considered to be a
regional detention facility by the city as more particularly described herein.
In some instances, certain nonsingle-family residential parcels may have the
space needed and the location desired for construction of a regional detention
basin. Regional detention basins can have a great overall benefit to the city's
storm drain system. In order for a property to be considered a regional
detention facility, it must have the needed space to construct facilities that
can detain the property's own runoff as well as additional amounts of
stormwater runoff from other properties within the same drainage basin. It must
also be in a geographical location that is in agreement with the city's storm
drain master plan and stormwater management plan, as determined by the city.
Properties that qualify as regional detention facilities may receive an
approved credit under credit criteria #1 for on site detention plus an
additional credit based on the amount of additional regional detention that the
site can provide. Properties requesting additional credits for excess detention
must provide detention facilities with a maximum minimum 0.2 cfs per acre basin
outlet rate. The amount of additional credit given for a property that has
regional detention shall be based on the following table:
 
If on site detention exceeds the needed The additional amount of credit given
amount by:                              is:
35% - 49%                               35%
50% - 74%                               40%
75% or more                             45%
 
(3) Credit criteria #3: Property owner has constructed, installed and/or
maintains improvements that meet best management criteria as approved by the
city, state or federal agencies in accordance with the NPDES phase II program
for improving water quality for stormwater runoff.
               (A)   A maximum credit of thirty percent (30%) may be granted by
the city administrator, upon recommendation of the review committee, for the
installation and maintenance of improvements, facilities and/or measures that
meet best management criteria as approved by the city, state or federal
agencies in accordance with the NPDES phase II program for improving water
quality for stormwater runoff. A sample of city approved best management
practices are more particularly set forth in the Sunset City stormwater
management plan as adopted, and amended, by the city.
      7.   Approval And Granting Of Credit Or Adjustment: Each property owner,
or their agent, applying for a drainage utility fee adjustment or credit will
be required to complete a credit or adjustment application and submit this
application together with any required calculations and specific site data to
the city administrator. A review committee shall meet and evaluate the
adjustment or credit application and supporting documents. The review committee
shall consist of the stormwater official, public works director and city
engineer. The applicant may be invited to present his/her application, if
desired by the review committee. The review committee shall evaluate the merits
of each credit application and shall recommend to the city administrator the
approval or denial of the fee credit or adjustment and the recommended amount
of any credit or adjustment. The city administrator shall make the final
decision regarding fee credits and adjustments. The city administrator's
decisions for credit or adjustment may be based on the review committee's
recommendation, the data submitted, as well as the city administrator's and the
review committee's evaluation of how the facilities comply with and/or further
the city's storm drain master plan and stormwater management plan; the
sufficiency of the benefit of the on site facilities to the city's overall
storm drainage system; the amount of benefit that a facility provides to the
city in reducing the costs associated with operating and maintaining the storm
drain system; and whether the facility adds capacity or reduces the city's
costs in providing stormwater services. If approved, the monthly fee will be
reduced or adjusted in accordance with the amount granted by the city
administrator.
      8.   Duration Of Credits: Subject to amendment to this policy or the
city's storm drainage utility, any credit for the drainage utility fee granted
by the city shall remain in effect as long as the property owner, or their
agent, receiving the credit is in compliance with the criteria that the credit
is based upon. If a property owner, or their agent, is not in compliance, the
city may suspend the fee credit granted to the property owner or their agent.
   J.   Administration: The drainage utility shall be administered by the city
administrator.
   K.   Policies: The city administrator may recommend for adoption by the city
council policies and procedures to assist in the application, administration
and interpretation of this chapter. Said policies and procedures may be adopted
by resolution of the city council.
   L.   Appeals: Any person or entity aggrieved by a final decision of the city
administrator in implementing this chapter may appeal such decision to the city
council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city recorder within
fifteen (15) days from the date of the decision being appealed and stating the
specific grounds for the appeal. The city council may hold a hearing on the
appeal. The city council's decision shall be final and binding on all parties.

8-6-3: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND PERMIT:
   A.   City Stormwater Permit Required: Except as otherwise exempted under
subsection B of this section, any person or entity proposing to disturb one
acre or more of ground in connection with any development, land disturbance, or
construction activity within the city or any person or entity proposing to
disturb less than one acre of ground which is part of a larger common plan of
development that disturbs one acre or more ground shall be required to obtain a
stormwater permit from the city. Such permit is required to be obtained prior
to or in conjunction with the issuance of any demolition, excavation, land
disturbance, building, site plan, land use or subdivision permit or approval or
any development or construction activity within the city. A stormwater permit
shall also be required for any building permit for a structure requiring
earthmoving, unless otherwise waived by the stormwater official. In determining
whether to grant a waiver, the stormwater official shall consider the following
with respect to the property and circumstances associated with the same:
topography, vegetation, wetlands, steep slopes, sensitive areas, high water
table, proximity to water channels, creeks, well or riparian areas.
   B.   Exemptions: A stormwater permit is not required for the following
activities:
      1.   Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property or natural resources; or
      2.   Existing nursery and agricultural operations legally conducted as a
permitted main or accessory use.
   C.   City Stormwater Permit Application: A completed application for a
stormwater permit shall be submitted to the stormwater official on forms
provided by the city. All applications for a stormwater permit shall contain
the following information and/or documents:
      1.   The name, address and contact information for the owner of the site,
the developer of the site, contractors working at the site, and any consulting
firm retained by the applicant;
      2.   The proposed starting date and estimated completion date for the
proposed work and/or construction activity;
      3.   A city stormwater pollution prevention plan, as more particularly
described in subsection D of this section, for the subject property and the
proposed construction activities to be prepared and implemented in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this chapter;
      4.   A copy of the UPDES permit issued by the state and a copy of the
stormwater pollution prevention plan submitted in conjunction with the UPDES
permit for the subject property and the proposed construction activities, as
applicable;
      5.   The required stormwater pollution prevention review and application
fee as set forth in the city's fee schedule; and
      6.   A bond in the amount deemed sufficient by the city to cover all
costs and required performance under the terms and conditions of this chapter
regarding stormwater pollution prevention, including, but not limited to,
compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter, the stormwater
pollution prevention plan, and any additional conditions required by the
stormwater official or city engineer as provided herein. All bonds shall comply
with the provisions of subsection F of this section.
   D.   City Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan:
      1.   A city stormwater pollution prevention plan ("city SWPPP") shall be
required with all permit applications and shall include sufficient information
(e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, soil reports, erosion and sediment
control plan, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the
project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site,
both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and
acceptability of the structural and/or nonstructural BMPs proposed for managing
stormwater generated at the project site. The city SWPPP shall include a
landscaping plan in accordance with subsection Q3 of this section. The intent
of the city SWPPP is to determine the type of stormwater BMPs necessary for the
proposed project and to ensure adequate planning for long term operation,
management, and maintenance of stormwater runoff from future development. The
stormwater official may prepare a city SWPPP checklist for assistance in
preparing such plans.
      2.   For development, redevelopment or construction activities occurring
on a previously developed site, an applicant shall be required to include
within the city SWPPP BMPs for controlling existing stormwater runoff
discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this chapter to
the maximum extent practicable.
      3.   For developments, projects or construction activities involving a
residential, commercial or industrial subdivision, the applicant shall be
required to include with the city SWPPP individual lot development standards
and recommended BMPs for home or building construction activities within the
subdivision.
      4.   For projects, developments and construction activities requiring a
state UPDES permit and SWPPP, applicants may submit the SWPPP submitted to the
state for purposes of the city SWPPP, provided the city reserves the right to
require additional information or conditions in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
      5.   For individual lot developments, projects or construction activities
within a subdivision previously approved under the terms and conditions of this
chapter, including issuance of a city stormwater permit and city SWPPP, the
applicant may submit the city SWPPP submitted for the previously approved
subdivision, provided the city reserves the right to require additional
information or conditions in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      6.   The stormwater official may waive any city SWPPP requirements set
forth herein in conjunction with the issuance of a stormwater permit for any
building permit or individual lot development or construction activity which is
not subject to the federal EPA requirements to obtain a city stormwater permit
(i.e., disturbs 1 acre or more of ground in connection with any development,
land disturbance, or construction activity within the city or disturbs less
than 1 acre of ground which is part of a larger common plan of development that
disturbs 1 acre or more of ground). In determining whether to grant a waiver of
any of the city SWPPP requirements, the stormwater official shall consider the
following with respect to the property and circumstances associated with the
same: topography, vegetation, wetlands, steep slopes, sensitive areas, high
water table, well or riparian areas, and existing construction and
infrastructure.
   E.   Licensed Professional Engineer: All proposed stormwater facilities and
submitted plans shall be calculated, designed and certified by a licensed
professional engineer.
   F.   Bond: Prior to issuance of a stormwater permit, the applicant and
responsible parties shall enter into a bond agreement with the city to insure
completion of, compliance with, and performance under the terms and conditions
of this chapter regarding stormwater pollution prevention, including, but not
limited to, compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter, the
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any additional conditions required by
the stormwater official and/or city engineer as provided herein. The bond
agreement shall be in a form and contain such provisions as approved by the
city. Such provisions may be included in and combined with any other additional
bonds required for the project, development or construction activity, such as
the public improvements bond for subdivisions. The bond amount shall be
determined by the stormwater official and city engineer on a case by case basis
depending upon the property and circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the stormwater BMPs proposed for the project. The city shall have the right to
use the bond proceeds in the event the permit holder fails to comply with the
terms and conditions of the bond agreement. The city shall retain a percentage
of the bond proceeds to cover administrative costs incurred by the city in
obtaining compliance or completion of improvements. If the bond proceeds are
inadequate to pay the cost of completion of, compliance with, and performance
under the terms and conditions of the bond agreement, the permittee shall be
responsible for the deficiency and no further construction or development
activities shall be conducted on the project until the deficiency is paid or
remedied and a new bond, satisfactory to the city, is executed and delivered.
   G.   Permit Review And Approval: The stormwater official and/or city
engineer shall review all stormwater permit applications and city SWPPP for
compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter. In the event the
stormwater permit application or city SWPPP as submitted is deemed inadequate
or fails to meet the terms and requirements of this chapter, the stormwater
official and/or city engineer may require additional information or impose
additional conditions and requirements on the proposed construction activities
to the extent necessary to bring the application and/or plan into compliance
with the terms and purposes of this chapter. Failure to comply with the terms
and conditions of this chapter shall be grounds for denial of the stormwater
permit and/or any development, land use, subdivision or land disturbance permit
or approval. No construction activity, land use or land disturbance activity
shall occur on the subject property until a stormwater permit is approved by
the stormwater official and/or city engineer.
   H.   Notice Of Commencement Of Work: After issuance of a permit, the
stormwater official shall be notified by the permittee of proposed commencement
of the work at least twenty four (24) hours prior to commencement of work.
   I.   Permit Duration And Extensions: A stormwater permit shall be valid for
the time period specified in the permit. If the work is not completed during
such period, prior to the expiration of the permit, the permittee may apply to
the city for a permit extension. A permit extension shall be reviewed and
approved by the stormwater official and/or city engineer and shall only be
issued upon a showing of good cause. The length of the extension shall not
exceed the original term and shall be determined by the stormwater official
and/or city engineer. Any extension shall require written review and amendment
to the stormwater permit, SWPPP, and bonding, as necessary.
   J.   Permit Not Transferable Or Assignable: Stormwater permits shall not be
transferable or assignable and work shall not be performed under a permit in
any place other than that specified in the permit. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent a permittee from subcontracting the work to be performed under a
permit; provided, however, that the holder of the permit shall be and remain
responsible for the performance of the work under the permit, and for all
bonding, insurance and other requirements of this chapter. Subcontractors shall
be appropriately licensed, insured and bonded.
   K.   Compliance With Other Ordinances: The issuance of any stormwater permit
by the city shall be subject to and conditioned upon compliance with all
applicable city ordinances regarding the proposed land disturbance or
construction activity, including, but not limited to, subdivision ordinance,
zoning ordinance, excavation, erosion control and grading permit ordinances,
and other land use development requirements.
   L.   Permit Kept On Site: Any approved stormwater permit, SWPPP and all
related documents and plans shall be kept on site at the project.
   M.   Inspection: Field inspections may occur during and postconstruction to
verify BMPs are built and properly designed and to ensure BMPs are properly
maintained. Field inspections for compliance with this chapter and any permits
issued hereunder shall be conducted by the stormwater official, the city
building inspector, the city ordinance enforcement officer, and/or other
designated agent of the city. The stormwater official may prepare an inspection
checklist to assist in field inspections.
   N.   As Built Plans: In addition to all other ordinance requirements, all
permittees subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter are required to
submit actual as built plans for any and all permanent stormwater BMPs and
facilities after final construction is completed. As built plans must show the
final design specifications for all stormwater BMP facilities and must be
certified by a licensed professional engineer. A final inspection by the
stormwater official and/or city engineer is required before release of any bond
may occur.
   O.   Notice Of Termination (NOT):
      1.   Operators: Operators wishing to terminate coverage under the city
stormwater permit must submit a notice of termination (NOT) to the city. Such
NOT shall be submitted to the stormwater official.
      2.   Permittees: All permittees must submit a NOT within thirty (30) days
after completion of their construction activities and final stabilization of
their portion of the site, or another operator taking over all of their
responsibilities at the site. A permittee cannot submit a NOT without final
stabilization unless another party has agreed to assume responsibility for
final stabilization of the site. Appropriate enforcement action may be taken
for permit violations where a permittee submits a NOT but the permittee has not
transferred operational control to another permittee or the site has not
undergone final stabilization.
   P.   Stormwater Management Performance Criteria: Unless determined by the
stormwater official and/or city engineer to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be utilized and addressed for stormwater
BMPs at all sites and proposed land disturbance or construction activities.
      1.   All site designs shall establish stormwater BMPs to control the peak
flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms
(specified by the UPDES stormwater general permit for construction activities
UTS 100000) and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
      2.   No stormwater runoff generated from new development shall be
discharged directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without
adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the
proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the stormwater official and city engineer. In no case shall the
impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the army corps of
engineers (ACE) or the department of environmental quality (DEQ) responsible
for natural resources.
      3.   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the postdevelopment site shall mimic the annual
recharge from predevelopment site conditions. This subsection shall not apply
to areas with high water tables.
      4.   All site designs shall establish stormwater BMPs to minimize, to the
maximum extent practicable, sediment, debris and all other pollutants from
entering the storm drain system during all phases of demolition. The owner,
developer, contractor and/or their authorized agents shall be responsible for
the removal of all construction debris, dirt, trash, rock, sediment, and sand
that may accumulate in the storm drain system and stormwater appurtenances as a
result of site development.
      5.   All site designs shall establish stormwater BMPs to minimize, to the
maximum extent practicable, soil erosion. Any earth disturbance shall be
conducted in such a manner so as to effectively reduce accelerated soil erosion
and resulting sedimentation. All earth disturbances shall be designed,
constructed, and completed in such a manner so that the exposed area of any
disturbed land shall be limited to the shortest possible period of time. Soil
erosion control measures for all slopes, channels, ditches, or any disturbed
land area shall be completed within fourteen (14) calendar days after final
grading, or final earth disturbance, has been completed. All temporary soil
erosion control measures shall be maintained until permanent soil erosion
control measures are implemented.
      6.   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater BMPs.
      7.   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
      8.   Postconstruction stormwater BMPs, where practicable, shall be
installed during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater
discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed.
Postconstruction stormwater BMPs may include, but are not limited to,
stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); stormwater retention
structures; flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions; infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems (which
combine several practices).
      9.   Prior to design, applicants shall consult with the stormwater
official to determine if the project or activity is subject to additional
stormwater design requirements.
   Q.   Stormwater Management Design Criteria:
      1.   Site Design: Stormwater BMPs for a site shall be chosen based on the
physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered:
         a.   Topography;
         b.   Maximum drainage area;
         c.   Depth of water table;
         d.   Removal of suspended sediment;
         e.   Soils;
         f.   Slopes;
         g.   Terrain;
         h.   Elevation head; and
         i.   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features.
      2.   Conveyance: All stormwater BMPs shall be designed to convey
stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include, but is not limited to:
         a.   Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
         b.   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
         c.   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
         d.   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
      3.   Landscaping: When deemed necessary by the stormwater official or
city engineer, all stormwater BMPs and city SWPPP shall have a landscaping plan
detailing both the vegetation to be in the project and how and who will manage
and maintain this vegetation. When required, this plan shall be prepared by a
registered landscape architect.
      4.   Maintenance: The permittee carrying out all BMPs and control
measures under the provisions of this chapter, and all subsequent owners or
tenants of the property on which such measures have been taken, shall maintain
all temporary and permanent BMPs and control measures. Should the permittee, or
any subsequent property owner and/or tenants, fail to adequately maintain the
temporary and permanent BMPs and control measures, the city reserves the
authority to enter the affected property and to take such action as is
necessary in accordance with the enforcement and violation provisions of
section
8-6-5 of this chapter.
   R.   Waivers:
      1.   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required
by this chapter unless a written request to waive such requirement is filed
with and approved by the city. Requests to waive the stormwater management
permit and/or plan requirements shall be submitted to the stormwater official
and shall be reviewed and approved by the stormwater official and the city
engineer. The city is not authorized to grant any waiver of state or federal
requirements and no waiver granted by the city hereunder shall be interpreted
to grant such authority. The decision to grant a waiver under this subsection
shall be within the sole discretion of the city.
      2.   The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant and approval by the
city, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
         a.   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter;
         b.   Alternative minimum requirements for on site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the stormwater official and city engineer and the
implementation of the plan is required by city ordinance;
         c.   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off site facility.
The off site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice; or
         d.   The stormwater official and city engineer find that meeting the
minimum on site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.
      3.   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the
stormwater official and city engineer may grant a waiver from strict compliance
with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the stormwater official and city engineer
that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream
waterways:
         a.   Deterioration of existing culverts, and other structures;
         b.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         c.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; or
         d.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
property.
      4.   Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management
is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one
of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional stormwater authority.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         a.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant
of an easement to be dedicated for preservation. These lands should be located
adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to
protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
         b.   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private,
that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed
in accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter; or
         c.   Monetary contributions (fee in lieu) to fund stormwater
management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland
delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macro
invertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species
studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater BMPs).
   S.   Fee In Lieu: Where the city waives all or part of the minimum
stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the
provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed
development, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount
determined by the city in accordance with the provisions of this section. When
an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the
monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule
(unless the developer and stormwater authority agree on a greater alternate
contribution) established by the city, and based on the cubic feet of storage
required for stormwater management of the development in question. All of the
monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements
program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of
any city approval or permit for the development, land disturbance or
construction activity.
   T.   Dedication Of Land: In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant
may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an
agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of
land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off site
stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the
applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats, or, if no record plat
is required, prior to city approval or permit for the development, land
disturbance or construction activity. (Ord. 2012-03, 10-2-2012)

and buffer strips may be increased to ensure compatibility. Site compatibility
is particularly important when commercial or industrial projects are developed
adjacent to residential and professional office zones.
         d.   Fencing may be required depending on the adjacent land use and
the applicant's security needs. Where visual barrier fencing containing wood,
metal, plastic or vinyl strips is either proposed by the applicant or required
by the city, such strips shall be properly secured. Screening of any outside
storage shall be required if appropriate, with a combination of fencing, walls,
live plants and/or earth berming. Fences shall be constructed so that
significant variations in top line, bottom line and/or height does not occur
due to erratic grading of the site. (Ord. 2002-05, 4-2-2002)
      2.   The following criteria is applicable to developments:
         a.   Exterior Masonry: Masonry will be required on the exterior of all
developments. The minimum area (A) of masonry required (measured in square
feet) will be determined by multiplying the outside perimeter (P) of the
foundation (measured in feet), including the garage, by four feet (4') as
follows:
            P x 4 = A
The planning commission shall determine the type of masonry to be used that
would meet architectural standards of appearance and conformity with
surrounding structures.
         b.   Facade Variations: Structures greater than sixty feet (60') but
less than one hundred twenty feet (120') in length must exhibit a prominent
shift in the facade of the structure so that no greater than seventy five
percent (75%) of the length of the building facade appears unbroken. Each shift
shall be in the form of either a ten foot (10') change in building facade
alignment or a ten foot (10') change in roofline height, or a combined change
in facade and roofline totaling ten feet (10'). Structures which exceed one
hundred twenty feet (120') in length on any facade shall provide a prominent
shift in the mass of the structure at each one hundred twenty foot (120')
interval (or less if the developer desires) reflecting a change in the function
or scale. The shift shall be the form of either a fifteen foot (15') change in
the building facade alignment or fifteen foot (15') change in roofline. A
combination of both the roofline and facade change is encouraged. To that end,
if the combined change occurs at the same location of the building place a
fifteen foot (15') total change will be considered as full compliance.
         c.   Screening: All developments shall hide/screen all mechanical
equipment. (Ord. 2002-05, 4-2-2002; amd. Ord. 2021-01, 6-1-2021)

10-5F-4: Parking
10-5F-5: Permitted Materials
10-5F-6: Prohibited Uses

10-5F-1: PURPOSE:
The Boulevard Mixed Use Zone (BMU) is designed to encourage infill and
redevelopment opportunities while creating a mix of retail, office and
residential uses. Commercial uses are limited to convenience retail, service
and professional offices. Building heights are limited to five (5) stories of
habitable use from finished grade to roofline. (Ord. 2017-07, 11-21-2017)
10-5F-2: BOULEVARD MIXED USE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Proposed developments within the BMU Zone shall submit the following
items to the City before project approval can be given:
      1.   Design/development guidelines, at a minimum, addressing the
following:
         a.   General site engineering (e.g., storm drainage, provision of
utilities, erosion control, etc.);
         b.   Architectural guidelines, including building setbacks, height,
massing and scale, site coverage by buildings, materials and colors;
         c.   Landscaping and open space standards and requirements;
         d.   Signage;
         e.   Exterior lighting;
         f.   Parking, vehicular circulation and access to the site;
         g.   Rights of access within the center, use of cross easements,
pedestrian links, etc.;
         h.   Development phasing and improvement/amenities to be completed
with each phase;
         i.   Outdoor storage, sales, and equipment;
         j.   Fencing and walls;
         k.   Street alignment and requirements; and
         l.   Special features for the Boulevard Mixed Use Zone.
      2.   Development agreement between developer and Sunset City.
      3.   Anticipated project timeline. (Ord. 2017-07, 11-21-2017)
10-5F-3: VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF LAND USES:
   A.   The design and functioning of the areas in the Mixed Use Zone may be
designed to achieve either a vertical or horizontal structure of activity along
Main Street.
      1.   Vertically Mixed: The following broad categories generally describe
the character of a vertical structure. First floor uses primarily being small
retail and service businesses and offices. The dominant orientation of doors
and windows shall be toward the primary streets central to the Mixed Use Zone
areas, i.e., Main Street. Individual or shared entrances for upstairs
residential units may be located at the first floor level, with parking garage
access at the side or rear, away from Main Street. Plazas may be located
adjacent to the primary streets. Upper floor uses may contain offices and
residential dwelling units, including home occupations as permitted. Balconies,
decks, and rooftop gardens are encouraged.
      2.   Horizontally Mixed: Horizontal structure combines single-use
buildings in a range of land uses within one block. In more urban areas, this
approach avoids the financing and coding complexities of vertical layered uses
while achieving the goal of mixing uses in one place. In less urban areas,
horizontal mixed-use offers the advantage of sharing utilities and amenities
while providing an easier to build and entitle mix of uses within a walkable
block circumscribed by thoroughfares. (Ord. 2017-07, 11-21-2017)
10-5F-4: PARKING:
   A.   Sunset City desires to encourage the redevelopment of smaller sites by

change of use in an existing building, even where the existing parking may be
nonconforming. Additional parking must be provided in accordance with these
standards for any building addition that adds new habitable or leasable floor
area. Amount of additional parking shall be calculated based upon new square
footage only.) (Ord. 2017-07, 11-21-2017)

The design and functioning of the areas in the mixed-use zone will be designed
to achieve a vertical structure of activity in the zone. The following broad
categories generally describe the character of the TC Zone:
   A.   Ground-floor uses shall be a minimum twenty five percent (25%)
commercial office or retail uses.
      1.   Where development plans may include multiple structures, this
requirement may be calculated against the total ground floor space of the
development, instead of each individual building, as allowed by the Planning
Commission and City Council.
      2.   Up to one hundred percent (100%) residential use may be allowed by
the Planning Commission and City Council, but the purpose is to create a mix of
retail, office and residential use.
   B.   The dominant orientation of doors and windows shall be toward the
public streets and common areas.
   C.   Individual or shared entrances for upstairs residential units may be
located at the first-floor level, with parking garage access at the side, rear

10-5G-4: PARKING:
   A.   Sunset City desires to encourage the redevelopment of smaller sites by
providing a more flexible approach to parking and to make efficient use of
available on-street parking. Shared use parking shall be encouraged. The amount
of off-street parking required may be reduced by an amount that can be
demonstrated may be in demand at different intervals of time throughout the
day.
   B.   Total parking requirement for mixed-use developments may be reduced
with "shared" spaces dedicated to residential in the evening and retail or
commercial use during daytime hours. There must be a mitigation or management
measure in place to accommodate this, such as permit parking, stall monitoring,
or other management measure approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council.
   C.   Minimum Required Residential On-Site Parking:
      1.   Studio: One (1) space;
      2.   One (1) Bedroom: One and one half (1.5) spaces:

building types, location, size, heights, number of residential units, access
roads, open spaces, parking and landscaping may be approved by the Planning
Commission and City Council and building permits issued in accordance with such
plan, even though the residential uses, housing types, and the location of the
buildings proposed differ from the residential uses, housing types, and
regulations governing such uses in effect in the zone in which the development
is proposed, provided the provisions of this Chapter are complied with.
   C.   Nonresidential Uses; Exception: Accessory nonresidential uses may be
included in the development to provide the necessary service to the residents
of the development as determined by the Planning Commission and City Council.

(Zoning Ord.; amd. Ord. 16-3-1, 8-3-1982)
   B.   Dwelling Units: The number of dwelling units in a PRUD may be ten
percent (10%) higher than the number of dwelling units permitted by the area
regulations of the zone in which the PRUD is located in accordance with the
following:
      1.   Land for schools, churches and other nonresidential service type
uses and land used exclusively for access to the usable area of a PRUD shall
not be included in the area used for determining the number of allowable
dwelling units.
      2.   The amount of bonus, if any, shall be determined by the Planning
Commission after considering the proposed site in relation to public services
and facilities, surrounding residential density and land use, adequacy of
traffic access, topographic considerations and other related conditions.
   C.   Compliance: All proposed residential developments, with the exception
of normal land subdivision, within the City equal to or in excess of the
minimum area requirements for a PRUD as set forth in subsection A of this
Section shall comply with the provisions of this Chapter and be developed as a
PRUD. Land to be developed as a normal subdivision will be subject to the
provisions of the Subdivision Title 1 . (Zoning Ord.)

in the absence of appropriate physical boundaries, that uses of least intensity
or greatest compatibility be arranged around the boundaries of the project.
Yard and height requirements of the adjacent zone shall apply on the periphery
of the project.
   C.   Determination Of Site Development Standards; Signs: Site development
standards and sign regulations shall be determined when approving the site
development plan.
   D.   Preservation Of Open Space: The City Council, upon recommendation of
the Planning Commission, shall require the preservation, maintenance, and
ownership of open space utilizing at the City's option one of the following
methods:
      1.   Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system; or

said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in
recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of a
homeowners' association, established with articles of association and bylaws
which are satisfactory to the City; or
      3.   Complying with the provisions of Condominium Ownership Act of 1963,
title 57, chapter 8, Utah Code Annotated, as amended, which provides for the
payment of common expenses for the upkeep of common areas and facilities.
Recreational uses and facilities may be developed within the common open space
areas on compliance with a recreation and landscaping plan approved as part of
the approved final development plan of the PRUD.
      4.   If the second or third method, subsection D2 and D3 of this Section,
is utilized to maintain the open spaces, but the organization established fails
to maintain the open spaces in reasonable order and condition, the City may, at
its option, do or contract to have done the required maintenance and shall
assess ratably the open space and individually owned properties within the
PRUD. Such assessment shall be a lien against property and shall be filed with
the County Recorder, or the City may bring suit to collect the maintenance
fees, together with reasonable attorney fees and costs.

escrow or bank letter of credit, in an amount determined by the City Engineer,
guaranteeing the completion of the development of the open space, or a phase
thereof. When completed in accordance with the approved plan, the bond shall be
released. If uncompleted at the end of two (2) years, the City will review the
progress and may proceed to use the bond funds to make the improvements to the
open space areas in accordance with the approved plan. The bond shall be
approved by the Mayor and by the City Attorney and shall be filed with the City
Recorder.
      6.   Where access roads create corner lots of adjoining parcels of land,
the location of the access road shall be located so as to maintain the minimum
corner lot side yard requirements of the zone in which the corner lot is
located, plus an additional ten foot (10') planting and walking area.
      7.   If the PRUD is to be subsequently divided either as a "subdivision"
into phase development parcels or separately owned and operated units, such
division boundaries shall be indicated on the development plan and preliminary
subdivision approval concurrently obtained in the case of a "subdivision".
      8.   The Subdivision Title of the City as it now or hereafter exist
applies to all developments.
      9.   Once the overall development plan showing details of buildings,
structures and uses has been approved by the City Council after recommendations
from the Planning Commission, no changes or alterations to such development
plans or uses shall be made without first obtaining approval of the Planning
Commission. Major revisions require City Council approval.

11-6-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Applicability: The procedures and requirements of this chapter shall
apply to and govern the processing of condominium record of survey maps
pursuant to the requirements of the condominium ownership act of 1975, Utah
Code Annotated title 57, chapter 8. Said procedures and requirements shall
supplement zoning, site development, health, building and other ordinances
applicable to a particular condominium project, and shall apply to the approval
of such projects involving new construction as well as those involving the
conversion of existing structures. In addition, condominium projects which
contemplate dedication of real property or improvements for the use of the
public, or condominium projects in which units are not contained in existing or
proposed buildings shall also be considered subdivisions requiring compliance
with the applicable provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Impact Assessment: It is the intent of this chapter to establish a
reasonable process whereby the city can assess the impact of mixing collective
and individual ownerships, as presented in a particular condominium project,
upon the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the city. In the
case of commercial or residential conversions of existing buildings,
corrections of building code violations, the upgrading of vehicle parking
facilities and safety of common functional elements of the structure or
structures are of prime importance. It is also recognized that the conversion
of existing apartments or similar multi-family rental dwelling structures
presents the potential of relocation hardship to existing tenants, especially

every tenant has executed a waiver relinquishing his or her right of notice
under this provision.
   B.   Contents: Such notice shall include:
      1.   The proposal for the conversion of the building to a condominium
project;
      2.   The established dates of construction period and termination of
occupancy which shall not be less than sixty (60) days from the date notice is
served upon occupants or expiration of individual leases, whichever is longer;
      3.   The disclosure of the sales price for each unit shall be no greater
than the price initially advertised and offered to the general public at such
time as when the condominiums are offered for public sale;
      4.   Relocation information for the tenants, specifying available
alternative housing relocation resource agencies and organizations and a plan
of any services to be voluntarily provided by the owner/developer.
   C.   Dissemination: A copy of said notice, together with a list prepared by
the owner/developer identifying names, apartment or unit numbers, approximate
ages, rental rates and other known special handicaps or factors affecting
relocation needs of the tenants, shall be submitted to the city to advise the
city of the conversion and/or solicit city assistance with relocation services.
No final approval of such conversion project shall be granted by the Planning
Commission until the owner/developer has provided proof of notice by certified
mail or subsequent proof of actual delivery by method of services allowed under
Utah Code Annotated, 1953, section 78B-6-805, of such notices and relocation
information as required above, and any plans for relocation services to be
voluntarily provided by the owner/developer and the time designated therein (a
minimum of sixty (60) days) has expired. (Ord. 2009-07, 7-21-2009; amd. Ord.
2024-01, 4-16-2024)
11-6-7: TENANT PROTEST REVIEW:
   A.   Procedure: When a tenant of a residential dwelling has received written
formal notice of eviction without cause and without at least sixty (60) days'
notice of conversion required above and has reason to believe that notice was
issued because of a proposed condominium project they may, within thirty (30)
days of the date of the notice of eviction, initiate an appeal regarding the
issue of proper notice to the City Council on a form provided in the city
office. The filing of such a protest shall stay the issuance of any approval or
issuance of any permits for the structure in question for a period not to
exceed thirty (30) days and the matter shall be set for hearing before the City
Council. Subsequent appeals shall not act to further stay the issuance of
approval of the condominium project and no stay shall be granted if the
building official certifies to the City Council that a stay would, in their
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, approval
shall not be stayed other than by order issued by the district court upon
petition, notice and due cause being shown.
   B.   Agency Assistance: Upon filing, a copy of the appeal shall be forwarded
to the city for relocation advice and assistance.
   C.   Investigation: Upon filing a tenant appeal, the planning staff shall
institute an investigation to determine if the notice requirements set forth
above were satisfied. They shall then report their findings to the City Council
within ten (10) days of filing the appeal.
   D.   Hearing:
      1.   The City Council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal, give due notice to the appellant and to the owner/developer of the
condominium project and shall, at said hearing, review said appeal together
with agency and department reports, recommendations and related permit or
subdivision applications, and shall decide the same within thirty (30) days
from the date of filing the appeal.
      2.   The City Council, with regard to the hearing of said appeals, may:
         a.   Enforce the attendance of witnesses, the production of books and
papers and administer oaths;
         b.   Direct municipal resources, if necessary and appropriate for the
alleviation of relocation hardships;
         c.   Hear and decide allegations of error in any order requirement,
decision or determinations made by a municipal official in performance of his
duties as related above;
         d.   See that laws and ordinances are faithfully executed and direct
investigations accordingly;
         e.   Institute any appropriate actions or proceeding to prevent
persons from or punish persons for performing any act contrary to the building
and zoning titles of the city;
         f.   Impose reasonable conditions relating to the terms and conditions
upon which the project will be approved, which may include suspension of
approval pending preparation and implementation of a reasonable relocation plan
or services for tenants who have not been given proper notice, or denial of the
application, in which event the owner/developer may not reapply for twelve (12)
months from the date of denial. (Ord. 2009-07, 7-21-2009; amd. Ord. 2024-01, 4-
16-2024)
11-6-8: FINAL APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION:
If, upon submission of the building official and planning staff, engineering
staff and fire marshal, the Planning Commission finds that the project is in
compliance with applicable ordinances and the requirements of preliminary
approval, the Planning Commission may grant final approval. The Planning
Commission will review recommendations from the planning staff, engineering
staff, the Fire Chief and building official for work that is proposed for
subsequent completion, bonding or waiver and may otherwise impose appropriate
terms upon such bonding or conditions upon its approval. (Ord. 2009-07, 7-21-
2009; amd. Ord. 2024-01, 4-16-2024)
11-6-9: APPROVAL BY CITY COUNCIL:
   A.   Upon final approval by the Planning Commission, the planning staff
shall ensure all conditions of approval have been completed, all final
documentation is signed and submitted, including any required bonds or
agreements required to be filed, and shall then submit the matter, together
with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, with the chair's signature
upon the map, before the City Council for final approval. If the City Council
shall determine said project is not in conformity with the requirements of the
ordinances of the city or if they reject any offers to dedication; or if not
satisfied with plans of a project which constitutes a subdivision, the City
Council may disapprove said map, specifying reasons for disapproval.
   B.   Within thirty (30) days after the City Council has disapproved any
project, the developer may file with the planning staff a map or documents
altered to meet the requirements of the City Council. Upon receipt of said map
or documents, the matter shall be referred back to the City Council by the
planning staff for reconsideration.
   C.   No final map shall have any force or effect until the same has been
approved by the city as reflected by the signature of the City Council and is
officially recorded with the city recorder within twelve (12) months from the
date of the City Council's approval. (Ord. 2009-07, 7-21-2009; amd. Ord. 2024-

TITLE 12
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
12-1-1: Statutory Authorization
12-1-2: Findings Of Fact
12-1-3: Statement Of Purpose
12-1-4: Definitions
12-1-5: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
12-1-6: General Provisions
12-1-7: Administration
12-1-8: Provisions For General Flood Hazard Reduction
12-1-9: Penalty
12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Utah has, in Utah Code Annotated section 10-8-
84, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses, promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Sunset City,
Utah, does adopt this chapter. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Sunset City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-4: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application:
   ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan
or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
   APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a
building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of
the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE or V, to
have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so
as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized
flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such
state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOODPRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls or structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historic significance of a registered historic district
or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a
registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      1.   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
      2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
   LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvement to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   RECREATION VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonable use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent
construction or structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation;
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for basement, footings or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not part of the main structure.
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of
construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the
NFIP regulations.)
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-5: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Sunset City.
   B.   Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study For
Sunset City" dated June 18, 2007, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps
and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are
hereby adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter.
   C.   Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or
have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the Sunset City council; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-7: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of Floodplain Administrator: The building inspector is
hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement the
provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (national
flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of Floodplain Administrator: Duties of the
floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      1.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining
to the provisions of this chapter;
      2.   Review permit applications to determine whether proposed building
sites, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding;
      3.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter;
      4.   Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local government
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required;
      5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation;
      6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is the department of public safety, emergency service
and homeland security, prior to any altercation or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management
agency;
      7.   Assure that flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained;
      8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with subsection
12-1-6B of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
this section;
      9.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or any other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30
and AE on the community FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community;
      10.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
developments in zones A1-30, AE and AH on the community's FIRM which increases
the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'),
provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision
through FEMA (conditional letter of map revision).
   C.   Permit Procedures:
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location,
dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and
proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
         b.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;

drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
         e.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with
subsection B1 of this section.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         c.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         d.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         e.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         f.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges,
public utilities, and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         h.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where
applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
   D.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and
render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      2.   The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      3.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      4.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request.
      5.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
      6.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvement to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection C2 of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      7.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objective of this
chapter.
      8.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      9.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historical structure
and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
      10.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
         a.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to avoid
relief.
         b.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         c.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of the flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      11.   Variances may be issued for a community for new construction,
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
         a.   The criteria outlined in subsections D1 through D9 of this
section are met, and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-8: PROVISIONS FOR GENERAL FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      2.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      3.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding;
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      6.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
      7.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in this chapter, the
following provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor
(including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of subsection
12-1-4C1a of this chapter is satisfied.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect.
      4.   Manufactured Homes: Require that all manufactured homes to be placed
within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods
and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse
or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state and local requirements for resisting wind forces.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM either:
         a.   Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         c.   Meet the permit requirements of subsection
12-1-7C1 of this chapter, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in subsection B4 of this section. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and
has no permanently attached additions.
   C.   Standards For Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections
12-1-1,
12-1-2, and
12-1-5 of this chapter.
      2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of subsections
12-1-6C,
12-1-7C of this chapter; and the provisions of this section.
      3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots
or five (5) acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to
subsection
12-1-6B or
12-1-7B8 of this chapter.
      4.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
      5.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
It is hereby found and declared by Sunset City that flooding has occurred in
the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur in the future; that
flooding is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury or death,
and is likely to result in substantial injury or destruction of property within
its jurisdiction; in order to effectively comply with minimum standards for
coverage under the national flood insurance program; and in order to
effectively remedy the situation described herein, it is necessary that this
chapter become effective immediately.
Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this chapter, being
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and
safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and
approval. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
12-1-9: PENALTY:
Any person who violates any term or provision of this chapter shall be guilty
of a class B misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and/or a jail sentence of not to exceed six (6)
months. (Ord. 2007-03, 6-19-2007)
