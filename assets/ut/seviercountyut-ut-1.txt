§ 10.01 TITLE OF CODE.
   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the county, as revised,
codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Sevier County
Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances” or
“code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
§ 10.02 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.03 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.04 CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.
   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws, amendments
thereto and newly enacted laws.
      (1)   Any previously existing law or amendment thereto reenacted by this
code shall continue in operation and effect as if it had not been repealed by
this code.

shall remain in full force and effect unless repealed or amended subsequent to
the enactment of this code.
   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is continued
only for the period designated in the original enactment of that appropriation.
   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does not
resolve a conflict between two or more sections.
   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved by
reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted. The section
most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or division.
   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to
the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as
originally enacted or as added by amendment, are not law and may be altered by
the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any official
publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings
are for organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application
or construction of the law they precede.
      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for reference
purposes only and is not a part of the section.
   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent
amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.
§ 10.05 RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Rules of interpretation. This code shall be construed by the following
rules unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the legislative intent or
context of the provision.
      (1)   Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary and usual
sense. Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in
law shall be understood according to their technical import.
      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons shall be
construed as imputing authority to a majority of the persons unless otherwise
declared in the section giving the authority.
      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent
or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act
by an authorized deputy or agent is valid.
      (4)   Words denoting the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the
feminine and neuter genders; words in the singular shall include the plural and
words in the plural shall include the singular; the use of a verb in the
present tense shall include the future, if applicable.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this code of ordinances, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

thereof, and as applied to corporations, the officers or agents thereof.

§ 10.06 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any section of this code now enacted or subsequently amended, or
its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity
does not affect other sections that can be given effect without the invalid
section or application.
   (B)   (1)   Except in the case of a section or amendment to this code
containing a nonseverability provision, each division or part of every section
is severable.
      (2)   If any portion or application of a section is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:
         (a)   The remainder is so essentially and inseparably connected with
and so dependent upon the invalid provision or application that it cannot be
presumed that the remainder would have been enacted without the invalid
provision or application; or
         (b)   The remainder is incomplete and incapable of being executed in
accordance with the legislative intent without the invalid provision or
application.
   (C)   This section applies to every section of this code regardless of
whether a section was enacted before or after the passage of this code.
   (D)   The repeal of a section or amendment stating that the provisions of a
chapter, subchapter or section are severable as provided in division (B) above
does not affect the operation of division (B) above with respect to that
chapter, subchapter or section.
§ 10.07 REFERENCE TO OTHER SECTIONS.
   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered unless the subject matter is changed
or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
Cross-reference:
   Repeal or modification of code sections, see §
10.11
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES; NAME DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   Reference to offices. Reference to a public office or officer shall be
deemed to apply to any office, officer or employee of the municipality
exercising the powers, duties or functions contemplated in the provision,
irrespective of any transfer of functions or change in the official title of
the functionary.
   (B)   Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Board
refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency,
authority or instrumentality of any government, and that name designation is
incorrectly stated; on the effective date of that ordinance or following the
effective date, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with that
entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board,
bureau, commission, department, division, officer, agency, authority or
instrumentality, whether correctly named in the ordinance at its effective date
or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the duties,
liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a
reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, REASONABLE TIME OR
NOTICE shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.
   (B)   The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day

   (A)   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former
section or law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section
or law is not revived unless it so expressly provides.
   (B)   The repeal of any section shall not extinguish or release any penalty,
forfeiture or liability incurred under the section unless the repealing section
so expressly provides.
   (C)   The section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the
purposes of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of
the penalty, forfeiture or liability.
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
   The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice
contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to
the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures,
contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code shall not be affected by
the repeal and reenactment, but all suits, proceedings and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may
be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been
enacted.
§ 10.13 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature and all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not embraced in this code shall remain in full force and
effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.

section of this code, the chapter or section shall be specifically repealed and
a new chapter or section, containing the desired amendment, substituted in its
place.
   (B)   Any ordinance which is proposed to add to the existing code a new
chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this
code, the proper number of the chapter or section. In addition to an indication
thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a caption or title
shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.
§ 10.15 SECTION HISTORIES; STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   As histories for the code sections, the specific number and passage

for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon conviction,

posting written notice of the electronic meeting at the anchor location.
   (E)   In addition to giving public notice as described above, the body shall
provide notice of the electronic meeting to the members at least 24 hours
before the meeting so that they may participate in the meeting and be counted
as present for all purposes, including the determination that a quorum is
present. All notices shall include a statement that one or more members will be
participating electronically, a description of how the member(s) so

present at the anchor location.
   (G)   Immediately prior to opening the meeting, the anchor member shall
communicate with the person who is participating electronically and ensure that

adjournment of the meeting, the communication line shall be kept open, unless

§ 30.017 OPENING CEREMONY FOR MEETINGS.
   (A)   (1)   The County Board of Commissioners has traditionally invited the
presentation of thoughts, readings and invocations as an opening ceremony
before certain of its meetings.
      (2)   This opening to the county’s legislative process is for a purpose,
among other reasons, to:

         (b)   Promote an atmosphere of civility;
         (c)   Encourage lofty thoughts and high-mindedness;

cost to the county. The county will not dictate the form or content of any such
presentation.
   (B)   It is the policy of the County Board of Commissioners to afford any
and all residents of the county the opportunity to be involved in such activity
and, therefore, the following procedure will be instituted.
      (1)   Every fifth year through public notices in the media and at civic
functions, county residents will be notified that applications are continuously
accepted for the opportunity to designate the invocation for specific meetings
to be held during the future.
      (2)   Each county resident of adult age is entitled to submit one
application.

   (B)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to conform the sales and use tax
of the municipality to the requirements of the Sales and Use Tax Act, U.C.A.

(Prior Code, § 3.04.020) (Ord. 1990-1, passed - -)

§ 33.004 SALES AND USE TAX.
   (A)   (1)   From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this subchapter, there is levied and there shall be collected and paid a tax
upon every retail sale of tangible personal property, services and meals made
within the county at the rate of 1%.
      (2)   An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other consumption
in the county of tangible personal property from any retailer on or after the
operative date of the ordinance codified in this subchapter at the rate of 1%
of the sales price of the property.
      (3)   (a)   For the purpose of this subchapter, all retail sales shall be
presumed to have been consummated at the place of business delivered by the
retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common
carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. In the event a retailer
has no permanent place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be as determined under the rules and regulations
prescribed by and adopted by the State Tax Commission.
         (b)   Public utilities as defined by U.C.A. Title 54 shall not be
obligated to determine the place or places within any county or municipality
where public utilities services are rendered, but the place of sale or the
sales tax revenue arising from such service allocable to the county shall be as
determined by the State Tax Commission pursuant to an appropriate formula and
other rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by it.
   (B)   (1)   Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act, all of the
provisions of U.C.A. Title 59, Chapter 12, as amended, are in force and effect
on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this subchapter insofar as
they relate to sales taxes, excepting U.C.A. §§ 59-12-101 et al are adopted and
made a part of the chapter as though fully set forth herein.

shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in this division (B)(2) shall be deemed
to require substitution of the name of the county for the word “state” when
that word is used as part of the title of the state’s Tax Commission, or of the
State Constitution, nor shall the name of the county be substituted for that of
the state in any section when the result of that substitution would require
action to be taken by or against the county or any agency thereof rather than
by or against the state’s Tax Commission in performing the functions incident
to the administration or operation of this subchapter.
      (3)   If a license has been issued, an additional license shall not be
required by reason of this section.
      (4)   There shall be excluded from the purchase price paid or charged by

state upon a retailer or consumer; and the gross receipts from the sale of or
the cost of storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
upon which a sales or use tax has become due by reason of the sale transaction
to any other municipality or other county in the state under the sales or use
tax ordinance enacted by that county or municipality in accordance with the
Sales and Use Tax Act.

RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS
§ 33.035 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   Utah Constitution Article XIII § 3(2)(a)(iv) and U.C.A. §§ 59-2-102(34) and
59-2-103(3) provide that a residential exemption from property tax of up to 45%
is available for residences, and the State Legislature enacted U.C.A. § 59-2-
103.5, establishing procedures to obtain an exemption for residential property
and authorizing the county legislative body to adopt an ordinance for the
allowance of a residential exemption for residential property.
(Ord. 2003-3-1, passed 3-3-2002)
§ 33.036 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   (1)   All owners of residential property as defined in U.C.A. § 59-2-
102(34) shall submit an application to the County Board of Equalization for
exemption from property taxes for residential property used as a primary
residence not later than March 1 of the current tax year.
      (2)   The application shall include the following information:
         (a)   Property parcel number and location address;
         (b)   Name of the applicant;
         (c)   Basis of the applicant’s knowledge of the use of the property;
         (d)   Description of the use of the property;
         (e)   Evidence of domicile of the inhabitant(s) of the property; and
         (f)   Signature of all owners of the property and a certification that
the property is residential property.
   (B)   In the event that an application is not timely filed, an exemption may
be granted by the Board of Equalization on an individual appeal basis for the
current tax year only. Applications for exemption shall be accepted for the
current year only.
   (C)   The County Board of Equalization may require an owner of the
residential property to file the application described in division (A) above
if:
      (1)   The residential property was ineligible for the residential
exemption authorized under U.C.A. § 59-2-103 during the calendar year
immediately preceding the calendar year for which the owner is seeking to claim
the residential exemption for that residential property;
      (2)   The ownership interest in the property changes; or
      (3)   The County Board of Equalization determines that there is reason to
believe that the property no longer qualifies for the residential exemption in
accordance with U.C.A. § 59-2-103.
   (D)   The County Board of Equalization or Assessor may request or collect
information sufficient to verify the primary residence status and make the
determination if the property is entitled to the residential exemption.
   (E)   If an applicant requests a property be designated as a primary
residence, the residential exemption shall not be granted without clear and
convincing evidence that the property serves as the primary residence. The
burden of proof shall remain at all times with the applicant.
(Ord. 2003-3-1, passed 3-3-2002)
§ 33.037 CRITERIA.
   (A)   (1)   A PRIMARY RESIDENCE means the location where domicile has been
established. DOMICILE means the place where an individual has a true, fixed,
permanent home and principal establishment, and to which place he or she has
(whenever he or she is absent) the intention of returning. It is the place in
which a person has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself or herself and
family, not for a mere special or temporary purpose but with the present
intention of making a permanent home.
      (2)   After domicile has been established, two things are necessary to
create a new domicile: first, an abandonment of the old domicile, and second,
the intention and establishment of a new domicile. The mere intention to
abandon a domicile once established is not of itself sufficient to create a new
domicile, for before a person can be said to have changed his or her domicile,
a new domicile must be shown. Factors or objective evidence determinative of
domicile are set forth in State Code Administrative Rule R884-24P-52(5).
   (B)   To qualify for the residential exemption, a property need not be owner
occupied. Apartments and other rental housing used as a primary residence of
the occupant(s) qualify for the residential exemption upon accepted application
in accordance with §
33.036(A) of this chapter. A PRIMARY RESIDENCE does not include property used
for transient residential use or condominiums used in rental pools. In addition
to other evidence of domicile, only the primary residence which is occupied
more than six months out of the year qualifies for the residential exemption.
The residential exemption is limited to up to one acre of land per residential
dwelling unit on a single property description.
   (C)   A partial exemption may be applied against the property taxes of mixed
commercial and residential property but it is presumed that the entire property
is commercial. This presumption may be rebutted by the filing of the
application in §
33.036(A) of this chapter, which includes evidence of domicile of each
qualifying resident. The Assessor may require additional information as
necessary to make a determination of the percentage of the property qualifying
for the residential exemption.
   (D)   A partial exemption may be applied against the property taxes of
qualifying nursing homes. In addition to the information required in §
33.036(A) of this chapter, the affidavit shall include the number of residents
living at the facility and the number that have established their primary
residence at the facility; the total square footage of the facility and the
total nonresidential square footage. The Assessor may require additional
information as necessary in order to determine the percentage of eligibility of
the property for the exemption.
(Ord. 2003-3-1, passed 3-3-2002)
§ 33.038 GRANDFATHER PROVISION.
   As of the effective date of this subchapter, owner-occupied residential
property, apartments and other rental property being used as the primary
residence of the occupants, and where the property is currently listed by the
County Assessor as having a residential exemption, shall not be required to
file an application to continue its status. Owner-occupied residential
property, apartments and other rental property being used as the primary
residence of the occupants where the property is subsequently listed by the
County Assessor as having a residential exemption constructed after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this subchapter shall not be
required to file the application required by §
33.036(A) of this chapter. However, should use change from primary residence,
the property shall no longer be considered exempt and an application and
affidavit under the provision of this subchapter shall apply.
(Ord. 2003-3-1, passed 3-3-2002)
§ 33.039 CONFLICT.
   In the event of any conflict between this subchapter and state or federal
law, the provisions of the latter shall be controlling.

§ 33.040 INCORPORATION PROVISION.

Administrative Rule 884-24P-52; criteria for determining primary residence
pursuant to U.C.A. §§ 59-2-102 and 59-2-103; and Property Tax Standard 2.10,

exceed 4.25% and provide a measure therefor that can be administered and
collected by the county in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practical to
the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Tax
Commission in administering and collecting the sale and use taxes of the state;
and
   (D)   To adopt a transient room tax ordinance that can be administered in a
manner that will provide funds for the purposes of establishing, financing and
promoting tourism, recreation and convention bureaus and such other purposes as
have been authorized by law for the expenditure of transient room taxes, and
for that purpose create, at the discretion of the county, a reserve fund
comprised of any funds collected but not expended during any financial year.

subsequently acquiesced to its presence, the Board of Commissioners shall not
assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the
property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such
costs from such owner of the land.
   (D)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not
appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the Board of

desist from any efforts to solicit at the residence or dwelling and shall
immediately depart from such property.

advocating to knock on the door, ring the doorbell or in any other manner
attempt to attract the attention of an occupant of a residence that bears a “No
Solicitation” sign or similar sign or placard for the purpose of engaging in or
attempting to engage in advocating, a home solicitation sale, door-to-door

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of this state has in statutes delegated the responsibility
of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood
losses. Therefore, the county does ordain as follows.
   (A)   The county elects to comply with the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001 through 4138. The National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a voluntary program administered by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security, and the county’s officials have elected to join the
program, participate and enforce this flood damage prevention chapter and the
requirements and regulations of the NFIP.
   (B)   The NFIP, established in the aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the
county having a special flood hazard be identified by FEMA and that floodplain
management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. Furthermore, the
county may elect to administer this chapter to areas not identified as special
flood hazard areas (SFHAs) by FEMA on the community’s effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) if the community has documentation to support that there is an
inherent risk of flooding in such areas.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters, which results in potential loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief;
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the inhabitants of the county.
   (B)   These potential flood losses are caused by:
      (1)   The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that are known
to cause increases in flood heights and velocities;
      (2)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by structures vulnerable to
floods because they are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages; and
      (3)   Uses deemed unsuitable for floodplain areas or that do not account
for the increased flood risk.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community and to minimize public and private losses due
to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize damage to public infrastructure, including, but not limited
to, utilities, streets and bridges that are susceptible to flooding;
   (C)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions caused by flooding;
   (D)   Minimize public expenditures on flood-control projects;
   (E)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts that are associated
with flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the public;
   (F)   Protect and safeguard the welfare and safety of first responders
should an emergency response be needed;
   (G)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (H)   Promote that potential buyers are notified if properties are in a
flood area.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   To accomplish the purposes outlined in §
151.03 of this chapter, this chapter applies the following methods:
   (A)   Restricts or prohibits land uses that are dangerous to health, safety
or property in times of flooding, or cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
   (B)   Requires that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Controls filling, grading, dredging and other developments that may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure that is on the same parcel of property as a
principal structure. Its use is incidental to the use of the principal
structure. The ownership of the ACCESSORY STRUCTURE is the same owner as of the
principal structure. An ACCESSORY STRUCTURE is a nonresidential structure of
low value that is used solely for the parking of vehicles and storage of tools,
materials or equipment. No human habitation is allowed within an ACCESSORY
STRUCTURE.
   ADDITION. Any improvement that expands the enclosed footprint or increases
the square footage of an existing structure. This includes lateral additions
added to the side, front or rear of a structure, vertical additions added on
top of a structure and enclosures added underneath a structure.
   ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING. Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan
or similar landlord that originates at the apex. It is characterized by high-
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition;
and unpredictable flow paths.
   APEX. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landlord below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. See ACCESSORY STRUCTURE.
   AREA OF FUTURE-CONDITIONS FLOOD HAZARD. The land area that would be
inundated by the 1%-annual-chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions
hydrology.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, AH, AR/AO or AR/AH zone on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a 1% or greater annual chance
of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been
completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined
into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/
A or VI-30, VE or V. For the purposes of these regulations, the term SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREA is synonymous in meaning with the phrase AREA OF SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD-RELATED EROSION HAZARD. The land within a community
that is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The
area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After
the detailed evaluation of the special FLOOD-RELATED EROSION HAZARD AREA in
preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION or BFE. The water surface elevation of the 1%-annual-
chance flood event. It is the height in relation to mean sea level expected to
be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the
floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. It is also the elevation shown on
the FIRM and found in the accompanying Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Zones A,
AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30 or VE that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from the flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that
level in any given year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides. A walkout basement that does not require a step up to
grade is not considered a BASEMENT.
   BEST AVAILABLE DATA. Existing flood hazard information adopted by a
community and reflected on an effective FIRM, FBFM and/or within an FIS report;
or draft or preliminary flood hazard information supplied by FEMA or from
another source. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, state, other
federal agencies or local studies, the more restrictive of which would be
reasonably used by the community.
   BREAKAWAY WALL. A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the building or supporting foundation system. Any walls below the lowest
floor in a building in a V or VE Zone should give way under wind and water
loads without causing collapse, displacement or other damage to the elevated
portion of the building of the supporting pilings or columns. BREAKAWAY WALLS
apply only to V or VE Zones.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CHANNELIZATION. The artificial creation, enlargement, realignment or
alteration of a stream channel’s slope, shape or alignment. Streambank
restoration may be deemed as CHANNELIZATION.
   CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS  or C.F.R. The codification of the general and
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments
and agencies of the federal government.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION or CLOMR. FEMA’s comment on a proposed
project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic and/or hydraulic
characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the
existing regulatory floodway, the effective BFEs and/or the SFHA. The letter
does not revise an effective map; it indicates whether the project, if built as
proposed, would be recognized by FEMA.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL or CLOMR-F. FEMA’s comment
on a proposed structure or property. The letter does not revise an effective
map; it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be removed
from the floodplain.
   CRAWLSPACE. An under-floor space that has its interior floor area (finished
or not) not more than four feet from the bottom floor joist of the next higher
floor elevation, designed with proper openings that equalize hydrostatic
pressures of floodwater, and is not used for habitation. Reference §
151.58 of this chapter.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility or building where even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat. Typical CRITICAL FACILITIES include hospitals,
fire stations, police stations, schools, storage of critical records, assisted
living and similar facilities. Reference Article V, Section G. Standards for
Critical Facilities.
   DEED RESTRICTION. A clause in a deed that limits the future use of the
property in some respect. DEED RESTRICTIONS may impose a vast variety of
limitations and conditions. For example, they may limit the density of

the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current
of water and deposited along the path of the current; and
      (3)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or
an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in FLOODING as defined in this chapter.

is determined or reasonably believed to cause an adverse impact, the Floodplain
Administrator may require new construction, substantial improvements or other
development (including fill, grading or excavation) permitted in Zone A to have
an encroachment analysis done prior to the issuance of a floodplain development
permit. The encroachment analysis shall create a baseline of existing
conditions model and compare it to the proposed conditions model to determine
the potential impact of the project. Based on the findings, the Floodplain
Administrator may require as a condition of the permit a CLOMR to be submitted
and approved prior to any work occurring and/or that a LOMR be submitted to
FEMA within 6 months of completion of the development;
   (N)   Inspect all development as needed and at appropriate times during the
period of construction to ensure compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, including the proper elevation of structures;
   (O)   In addition to utilizing the effective FIRMs, FIS and Flood Boundary
and Floodway Map, all permit reviews will utilize best available data; and
   (P)   If the project is determined or reasonably believed to cause an
adverse effect on the BFE(s), boundaries of the floodplain or any insurable
structures, technical justification for the proposed development shall be
submitted, and the community may require a CLOMR or LOMR to be submitted prior
to the permit approval or as a requirement of the permit.

§ 151.35 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Requests for variances. The Board of Adjustment, as established by the
community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter after a floodplain development permit has been
denied.
      (1)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment, as established by the community, shall
hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error
in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to FEMA and the State
Coordinating Agency upon issuing a variance.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter.
      (6)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure. The term “substantial
improvement” does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed
on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic
Places.
   (B)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, considers the
need of ingress and egress during times of floods and does not jeopardize first
responders’ health and welfare.
      (2)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the BFE and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
      (3)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use, provided that:
         (a)   The criteria outlined in this section are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION PROVISIONS
§ 151.50 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements.
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage.
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the system and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be designed or located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.51 SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a building or structure if the cumulative cost of the entire
project equals or exceeds 50%, unless a higher standard option is selected
below, of the market value of the structure only (not of the structure and land
value combined) before the improvement or repair is started, then the work
shall be considered as substantial improvement. If the structure has sustained
substantial damage, any repairs are considered SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
regardless of the actual repair work performed. For substantial damage, refer
to §
151.52 of this chapter.
   (B)   The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building
Official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic
structure.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.52 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure only, unless a higher
standard option is selected, before the damage occurred. This term also applies
to structures which have incurred any damage that equals or exceeds 50% of the
structure’s market value regardless of the actual repair work performed. When a
structure or building has been determined as substantially damaged, any work or
repair on said structure or building will be considered as substantial
improvement and will be required to meet the development requirements set forth
within this chapter for substantial improvement.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.53 DETERMINING SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OR DAMAGE.
   For applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations and any other improvement of
or work on such buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in
coordination with the applicable community officials and staff, shall:
   (A)   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure only, not of land and building, before the start of
construction of the proposed work. In the case of repair, the market value of
the building or structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred
and before any repairs are made;
   (B)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
   (C)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as
specified in §
151.51 of this chapter;
   (D)   Utilize FEMA’s Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk
Reference when making any determination on substantial improvement and/or
substantial damage;
   (E)   The substantial improvement regulations apply to all of the work that
is proposed as the improvement, even if multiple permits are issued. Therefore,
the determination of the cost of the improvement should consider all costs of
all phases of the work before issuance of the first permit; and
   (F)   Notify the applicant that if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood, this chapter is required.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.54 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all SFHAs, and if best available data indicates that the area is a known
or suspected flood risk area, the provisions of §§
151.55 to
151.60 of this chapter are required.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.55 RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION.
   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to the BFE plus one
foot of freeboard. A registered professional engineer, architect or land
surveyor shall submit certified elevations to the Floodplain Administrator that
the standards of this chapter are satisfied.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.56 NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to the base flood level plus one foot of
freeboard, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level, the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall develop and/or review structural designs, specifications and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this
section. A record of such certification that includes the specific elevation
(in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall
be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   If the use or occupancy of the building changes in the future to
residential, then the dry floodproofing of the structure cannot be used when
determining compliance of the structure to the residential construction of this
chapter as seen in §
151.55 of this chapter. As such, the building will not be grandfathered into
compliance and will be required to be brought into compliance with the
residential construction requirements of this chapter. The development and
construction of the structure must conform to the provision in FEMA/FIA
Technical Bulletins 1, 2, 10 and 11. Certification and documentation from a
professional, licensed engineer or architect is required if the structure’s
lowest floor is built below the BFE.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.57 ENCLOSURES.
   (A)   (1)   New construction and substantial improvements with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are to be used solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement, and are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
      (2)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (B)   The development and construction of the structure must conform with
the provision in FEMA/Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) Technical
Bulletins 1 and 2. Certification and documentation from a professional,
licensed engineer or architect is required if the structure’s lowest floor is
built below the BFE.
(Ord. 2020-12-1, passed 12-14-2020)
§ 151.58 CRAWLSPACES.
   New construction and substantial improvements built on a crawlspace or a
subgrade (below grade) crawlspace may be permitted if the development is
designed and meets or exceeds the standards found in FEMA’s Technical Bulletins
1, 2 and 11, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (A)   The structure must be affixed to a permanent foundation, designed and
adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is
not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second
unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a
registered architect or professional engineer;
   (B)   The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be not
more than one foot above the LAG;
   (C)   The crawlspace enclosure must have proper openings that allow the
equalization of hydrostatic pressure by allowing automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. To achieve this, a minimum of one square inch of flood opening is
required per one square foot of the enclosed area subject to flooding;
   (D)   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, piers or other materials that extend below the BFE. Ductwork, in
particular, must either be placed above the BFE or scaled from floodwaters;
   (E)   Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated
above the BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within
the system components during flood conditions;
   (F)   The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than
two feet below the LAG;
   (G)   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the lowest
interior grade of the crawlspace floor to the bottom of the floor joist of the
next higher floor, cannot exceed four feet at any point;
   (H)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a flood event; and
   (I)   Buildings with below-grade crawlspaces will have higher flood
insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation at or above the LAG.

§ 151.59 MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   (A)   It is required that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A
on a community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices
that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   (B)   It is required that manufactured homes that are placed or
substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM on
sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the BFE, unless a higher standard
option was selected, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
   (C)   In A1-30, AH, AO and AE Zones, it is required that manufactured homes
to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park be
elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the BFE unless a higher
standard option was selected or the chassis is supported by reinforced piers
not less than 36 inches in height above grade and securely anchored.

encroachment upon existing county road rights-of-way.
   APPROACH. The part of the landowner’s driveway access that initially leaves
the active roadway.
   ASPHALT. A mixture of aggregates, binder and filler used for constructing
and maintaining roads, parking areas, railway tracks, ports, airport runways,
bicycle lanes and sidewalks.
   BLUE STAKE(S). To have the Blue Stakes service, provided by dialing 8-1-1,
locate the utilities in the vicinity of work being done.
   COUNTY. Sevier County, Utah.
   COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY. The corridor width for the road itself, all of
its appurtenant shoulders, culverts, drains, turnarounds and the like, and any
additional corridor width that constitutes the county’s rights-of-way therefor,
plus any and all other rights-of-way acquired by the county in or appurtenant
to the corridor width, all of which the county has acquired by any legal means,
including, but not limited to, conveyance, construction with county resources,
prescriptive use or dedication by public use.
   DEDICATED RIGHTS-OF-WAY. For any given county road rights-of-way, in
addition to its meaning under controlling state statutory and case law, means
that a duly recorded plat, survey or related document has been developed which
contains a legal description of a county road rights-of-way and which names the
county as the rights-of-way owner. Under controlling state law, a road may be
dedicated to the county for public motorized travel by mere continuous public
use for the required number of years or by construction with public funds, for
example. Therefore, the lack of a duly recorded plat, survey or related
document for any given county road rights-of-way does not alone render the
county’s rights-of-way for that road invalid.
   DESIGNATED PARKING. Areas that are marked by the county as parking areas.
Parking is not permitted within a county road rights-of-way unless it is
clearly marked for parking. Parking is not allowed on roadway shoulders within
a county road rights-of-way.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the construction or improvement of buildings,
structures, roads or accessory structures; the construction of additions, or
substantial alterations to buildings, structures, roads or accessory

construction of bridges and impoundments; the placement of mobile homes; the
carrying out of below-ground exploration or drilling operations; and the
depositing or extraction of earthen materials.
   DISPROPORTIONATE USE. Uses or impacts exceeding the functional design
specifications of an existing road, rights-of-way and/or associated structure,
or substantially expanding the normal use patterns thereof.
   ENCROACHMENT. Any disturbance of a county road rights-of-way.
      (1)   CLASS 1 ENCROACHMENT. Any short-term encroachment to a county road
rights-of-way that results from activities undertaken to construct and connect
residential driveways, other private roadways, private parking areas or other
private structures affecting or altering the shoulder of a county road rights-
of-way, or by the installation of cattle guards in or adjacent to a county road
rights-of-way.
      (2)   CLASS 2 ENCROACHMENT. Any short-term encroachment to a county road
rights-of-way caused by grading, construction, reconstruction, surfacing or
resurfacing, alignment or realignment, excavation, boring or jetting, cutting
of pavement, obstruction, removal of materials, vibroseising, heavy haulage or
any other extraordinary or disproportionate use, or use exceeding the function
thereof.
      (3)   CLASS 3 ENCROACHMENT. Any short-term encroachment to a county road
rights-of-way for excavating, boring, jetting, cutting of pavement or other
disturbance by utilities within county road rights-of-way for the purpose of
installing, repairing or maintenance of cables, pipelines and the like. A CLASS
3 ENCROACHMENT also includes any type of Class 2 encroachment that is caused by
utilities.
      (4)   CLASS 4 ANNUAL BLANKET ENCROACHMENT. The applicant has multiple
encroachments in multiple locations on one or more county road rights-of-way
for a project over the course of one year. This type of permit will alleviate
the necessity of obtaining separate performance and completion bonds for each
encroachment.
      (5)   CLASS 5 ENCROACHMENT. Any short-term encroachment to a county road
rights-of-way caused by overweight or over length/width vehicles. Overweight,
over length and over width vehicles are any vehicles hauling greater than legal
loads set forth by the State Department of Transportation.
   ENCROACHMENT PERMIT. The written permission given to an applicant by the
Supervisor conditionally authorizing an encroachment or a series of
encroachments on a county road rights-of-way or rights-of-way and setting forth
the detailed requirements, conditions, specifications and limitations thereof.
   EXISTING COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY. Any county road rights-of-way that is
recognized by the county as part of the County Road System.
   EXTRAORDINARY USE. Includes disproportionate use of a county road rights-of-
way as defined herein and any use or impact that is not typical or reasonably
contemplated by the county.
   HEAVY HAULAGE. A type of encroachment caused when a permit applicant intends
to haul a large volume of material on any county road rights-of-way. If HEAVY
HAULAGE is contemplated as part of an applicant’s requested encroachment
permit, the applicant must first consult with the County Road Department and
comply with the Department’s approved hauling routes.
   LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT. Such letter, or denial thereof, means a tentative,
conditional written approval, or denial, by the Supervisor stating, for each
lot shown in a professionally prepared survey plat of a proposed subdivision,
whether or not that lot may have an access to and from an existing county road
rights-of-way or proposed county road rights-of-way to be dedicated to the
county, and if so, whether more than one access will be allowed for each lot,
and if so, how many. Whether or not to issue or deny a LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT
is considered by the Supervisor only after he or she receives a professionally
surveyed plat of a proposed subdivision, which, in the judgment of the
Supervisor, is professionally and adequately prepared showing all necessary
technical and location specifications to enable the Supervisor to make an
informed decision. A LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT is considered and acted upon by the
Supervisor prior to, and as a prerequisite for, a landowner’s making an
application to the County Planning and Zoning Department for a proposed
subdivision. A LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT is not an actual encroachment permit as
defined herein, and a LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT is controlled by and subject to
the eventual approval or denial of an actual encroachment permit and its terms,
conditions and specifications. A LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT does not determine the
actual location of each proposed access for a given lot, as that is controlled
and subject to the encroachment permit application process and ultimate
encroachment permit and its terms, conditions and specifications. The LETTER OF
ENCROACHMENT, rather, merely determines for each lot in question whether and
how many accesses shall be allowed for each county road rights-of-way or
proposed county road rights-of-way that fronts, or may front, the lot. The
Planning and Zoning Department may at times require a LETTER OF ENCROACHMENT in
the case of a conditional use permit or other land use matters.
   LINE. Any pipeline, cable, wire or conduit used by a utility for
transmission of its product or services.
   MAINTENANCE. Work on a county road rights-of-way which, although
constituting an encroachment hereunder, is required to keep the same in good
condition, extend its life, repair normal wear and tear, repair, replace or
modify existing structures, including, but not limited to, poles, culverts,
pipelines, guardrails, signs or other items consistent with the existing
condition and design specifications of the roadway.
   MUTCD. The most recent edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control
Devices promulgated by the federal Highway Administration of the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any activity on or near a county road rights-of-way that
changes its current condition or use, including, but not limited to, the
installation, realignment, relocation and upgrading of poles, culverts,
pipelines, concrete pads, driveway approaches or other objects or structures
in, on or under the county road rights-of-way, including any upgrading,
construction, reconstruction, surfacing or resurfacing, and any necessary
impacts of such activity on the overall county road rights-of-way.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any object, or the placement thereof, or any practice,
occurrence or development that is deliberately done by a landowner or other
person or entity, or carelessly allowed by such persons or entities, which
unreasonably impairs the public’s right of passage along a county road rights-
of-way, or which damages, degrades or threatens to damage or degrade any county
road-rights-of-way. An OBSTRUCTION may include, but is not limited to, gates,
the overgrowth of trees and other vegetation, and irrigation practices of
adjacent or nearby landowners that cause inundation, flooding or erosion to the
surfaces of roads, shoulders, berms and ditches in and along a county road
rights-of-way.
   OVERWEIGHT, OVER LENGTH AND OVER WIDTH VEHICLES. Any vehicles hauling
greater than legal loads set forth by the State Department of Transportation.
   PERMITTEE. An applicant who has obtained an encroachment permit from the
county.
   ROAD IMPROVEMENT. Any surface type upgrade, any other surface work
improvement, any road realignment, including vertical and horizontal
realignments, any installation of culverts, drains, turnarounds and other road
appurtenances and any upgrading, widening, surfacing or relocating of any
structures upon any existing county road rights-of-way. ROAD IMPROVEMENT does
not include maintenance, repair and resurfacing of existing surface types.
   ROADBASE GRAVEL. Well-graded aggregate material that meets the county
standards as set forth in this subchapter.
   SERVIENT ESTATE. The land owned by a person or entity, including
governmental entities, other than the county across which a county road rights-

by virtue of the county road rights-of-way.
   STANDARDS or SPECIFICATIONS. The standards and specifications that are
determined and updated from time to time by the Supervisor upon review and
approval by the County Commission. Such STANDARDS and SPECIFICATIONS are
available for inspection at the County Road Department.
   SUPERVISOR. The County Road Department Supervisor or agent whom the
Supervisor expressly authorized to exercise the functions of the Supervisor
under this subchapter. This term does not permit reliance upon apparent
authority, apparent agency or actions by county road employees in general. All
pronoun references to the term SUPERVISOR in this subchapter include he or she,
as the case may be.
   UTILITY. Any entity who provides, through overhead and/or underground
pipelines, cables or conduits, public services to supply or transport gas, oil,

§ 152.08 EXCEPTION TO PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
   No encroachment permit shall be required hereunder where the proposed
encroachment constitutes mere maintenance of county road rights-of-way as the
term maintenance is defined in §
152.01 of this chapter. All other aspects of this subchapter, including, but
not limited to, liability insurance, notice, fees and minimum construction
standards, shall apply to any encroachment of any county road rights-of-way.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.09 ENCROACHMENT DENIAL.
   (A)   This subchapter expressly authorizes the Supervisor to issue a denial
of any application for an encroachment on any county road rights-of-way if the
Supervisor, in his or her discretion, determines that the proposed
encroachment:
      (1)   Will create safety issues for the county;
      (2)   Will create unwarranted cost increases for the county;
      (3)   Will unreasonably or excessively interfere with traffic patterns,
or disrupt use of the subject county road rights-of-ways for an unreasonably
extended period;
      (4)   Will cause violations of county agreements with other agencies, or
cause degradation to county road rights-of-way or the servient estate(s)
crossed by those county road rights-of-way;
      (5)   Is not reasonably necessary to a legitimate activity or can be
avoided by other reasonable measures;
      (6)   Is otherwise detrimental to the county’s best interests; or
      (7)   Does not advance or benefit the county’s best interests.
   (B)   This express authorization includes the authority for the Supervisor,
in his or her sole discretion, to decline an encroachment permit application
outright. The Supervisor shall issue such denial in writing, and shall state
his or her findings with regard to the application and state his or her reasons
for denying the application, and shall date, sign and mail or hand deliver a
copy of such denial to the applicant and to the County Board of Commissioners.
   (C)   In a case where the Supervisor denies an encroachment permit for the
lot or lots in question as applied for, or in a case where the Supervisor
issues an encroachment permit with one or more conditions that the applicant
finds objectionable, then the applicant, within 30 days of the date of written
issuance or denial of the encroachment permit, may submit a written request to
the County Board of Commissioners for review of the Supervisor’s action. The
Board of Commissioners shall allow the applicant an opportunity to appear and
be heard at a public meeting, either specially called or during a regularly
scheduled Commission meeting, not later than 20 working days following the
filing of the applicant’s said request for review, and the Board shall render
its decision in writing not later than ten days following such meeting.
   (D)   Any encroachment permit, conditional encroachment or denial thereof
shall advise the applicant of his or her right to submit a written request to
the County Board of Commissioners for review of the Supervisor’s decision and
shall set forth the language of the preceding subsection.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.10 LETTERS OF ENCROACHMENT.
   (A)   This section governs the Supervisor and County Road Department’s role
with respect to any letter of encroachment as that term is defined in §
152.01 of this chapter.
   (B)   A letter of encroachment, or a denial thereof, means a tentative,
conditional written approval, or denial, by the Supervisor stating, for each
lot shown in a professionally prepared survey plat, whether or not that lot may
have an access to and from an existing county road rights-of-way or proposed
county road rights-of-way to be dedicated to the county, and if so, whether
more than one access will be allowed for each lot, and if so, how many.
   (C)   The Supervisor shall not begin to address whether or not to issue or
deny a letter of encroachment until after he or she, or his or her designee in
the County Road Department, receives a survey plat professionally prepared by a
licensed surveyor of a proposed subdivision that, in the judgment of the
Supervisor, adequately shows enough technical and location information to
enable the Supervisor to make an informed decision.
   (D)   For each proposed subdivision, the Supervisor shall be allowed a
maximum of 20 working days from the date of his or her receipt, or his or her
designee’s receipt, of all information that satisfies the requirements of
division (C) above before the Road Department issues a letter or letters of
encroachment, or a denial or denials thereof, for that subdivision.
   (E)   No subdivision application may be submitted to the County Planning and
Zoning Department until the applicant receives the appropriate letter(s) of
encroachment from the County Road Department that tentatively approve(s) access
to and from an existing or proposed county road rights-of-way to the lot or
lots in question.
   (F)   The County Executive Administrator, in consultation with the County
Zoning Administrator, County Planning and Zoning Department, the County Road
Department, the County Recorder and the County Surveyor, shall institute a day-
to-day practice to ensure coordinated compliance with the aforementioned
requirements for letters of encroachment.
   (G)   A letter of encroachment is not an actual road encroachment permit as
defined and governed herein, and a letter of encroachment is controlled by and
subject to the Supervisor’s subsequent approval or denial of an application for
an encroachment permit, as well as subject to the terms, conditions and
specifications of the approved road encroachment permit.
   (H)   A letter of encroachment does not determine the actual location of
each proposed access for a given lot, as that is controlled and subject to the
road encroachment permit application process and ultimate encroachment permit
and its terms, conditions and specifications; the letter of encroachment rather
merely determines whether and how many accesses shall be allowed for each
county road rights-of-way, or proposed county road rights-of-way, that fronts,
or may front, each proposed lot in question. A site plan shall be submitted
with the permit application where new access will be placed and dimensions to
where the access will be installed. If a variance from the original site plan
is desired, a new submittal to the County Road Department will be required.
   (I)   In a case where the Supervisor does not timely issue a letter of
encroachment, or in a case where the Supervisor timely issues a letter of
encroachment but tentatively denies access to and from an existing or proposed
county road rights-of-way and the lot or lots in question as applied for, or in
a case where the Supervisor issues a letter of encroachment with one or more
conditions that the applicant finds objectionable, then the applicant, within
30 days of the date of the letter’s written denial (or 30 days of the last date
that the Supervisor had to timely issue the letter), may submit a written
request to the County Board of Commissioners for review of the Supervisor’s
action or non-action. The Board of Commissioners shall allow the applicant an
opportunity to appear and be heard at a public meeting, either specially called
or during a regularly scheduled Commission meeting, not later than 20 working
days following the filing of the applicant’s said request for review, and the
Board shall render their decision in writing not later than ten days following
such meeting.
   (J)   Any letter of encroachment, conditional letter of encroachment or
denial thereof shall advise the applicant of his or her right to submit a
written request to the County Board of Commissioners for review of the
Supervisor’s decision and shall set forth the language of the preceding
subsection.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.11 BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever a bond or guarantee is required hereunder, the same shall be
conditioned upon the complete reclamation and restoration of the site of the
encroachment. In each case, the bond or guarantee amounts shall be determined
by the Supervisor, but each bond or guarantee amount shall be not less than the
following:
      (1)   Hard surface road: $5,000 minimum per disturbance;
      (2)   Gravel surface road: $3,000 minimum per disturbance; and
      (3)   Dirt surface road: $3,000 minimum per disturbance.
   (B)   The bond or guarantee for construction, improvement, resurfacing and/
or realignment of county road rights-of-way due to encroachment may be
integrated with a project contract bond or special agreement.
   (C)   The Supervisor, as part of his or her review of each encroachment
permit application, shall determine the amount of the bond or guarantee
required, subject to the minimum amount requirements provided in division (A)
above, based upon the location, duration and extent of the proposed
encroachment together with all other pertinent factors.
   (D)   The Road Department shall condition the granting of a permit upon the
applicant’s delivery and the County Road Supervisor’s approval and receipt of
the bond or guarantee.
   (E)   Bonds or guarantees given pursuant to this subchapter shall remain in
force and effect for a period of three years from the completion date of any
project that encroaches on a county road rights-of-way, including, but not
limited to, projects to place utility lines, culverts and the like beneath the
surface of a county road rights-of-way and properly reclaim, restore and
resurface such county road rights-of-way afterwards.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.12 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   The Supervisor is authorized to require, as a condition for the granting of
an encroachment permit hereunder, a policy of liability insurance to be
obtained by the applicant, naming the county as co-insured, insuring,
indemnifying and holding the county harmless against liability for property
damage and personal injury claims in an amount not less than $5,000,000 per
occurrence, unless a different amount is specified and approved by the
Supervisor, which liability claims may result from road conditions created by
the encroachment. When such insurance is required, no permit shall be issued
until the policy or a valid binder therefor has been delivered to the Road
Department. Such insurance policy shall remain in force and effect for so long
as is specified by the Supervisor, not to exceed five years after the
completion of the project.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.13 ENCROACHMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Once an applicant has obtained an encroachment permit, work and any
haulage may begin during the specified time. Said work shall progress in a
prompt and orderly fashion without unnecessary delays and shall be performed in
a good and professional manner in accordance with the plans, specifications and
conditions set forth in the encroachment permit.
   (B)   The encroachment must come to an end within the time set forth in the
permit unless an extension is requested in writing by the permittee and the
Supervisor in writing finds good cause to grant the permittee’s request. In the
event the permittee fails to complete the permitted work by the completion
date, the Supervisor shall either require a new encroachment permit to be
issued, with new permit fees paid, or determine that such failure constitutes
grounds for the forfeiture of the bond or guarantee.
   (C)   Excavation operations shall be conducted in such a manner to ensure
minimum interference or interruption of road traffic and inconvenience to
residents and businesses fronting on public roads. Suitable, adequate and
sufficient barricades as specified in the MUTCD shall be provided by the
permittee and used where necessary to prevent accidents. Barricades must be
placed until all excavators’ equipment is removed from the site, excavation is
backfilled and a proper temporary gravel surface is placed. From sunset to
sunrise, all barricades and excavations must be clearly outlined by acceptable
warning lights, lanterns, flares and other devices as specified in the MUTCD.
The County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch, State Highway Patrol, all cities and
towns within a ten-mile radius of the project and local fire departments shall
be notified by the permittee at least 24 hours in advance of any planned
excavation requiring road closures or detours.
   (D)   Where required by the Supervisor, haulage activities shall require
continuous dust control and maintenance of the haul route to assure the safety
of motorists and other users.
   (E)   Special signing shall be required as indicated by the MUTCD.
   (F)   Any damage to any county road rights-of-way shall be promptly reported
by the permittee to the Supervisor.
   (G)   All loads shall be legal under applicable state law, and drivers shall
strictly comply with all applicable vehicle and traffic laws.
   (H)   Unless otherwise agreed to by the Supervisor, all costs for dust
control maintenance, signing, repairs and preventive measures shall be borne by
the permittee.
   (I)   The permittee, its employees, contractors and associates shall be
bound by all conditions and agreements in effect between the county and other
governments, private agencies and individuals to the degree such matters are
set forth in the encroachment permit or are otherwise known to the permittee.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.14 EMERGENCY ENCROACHMENTS.
   (A)   The County Board of Commissioners recognizes that emergency conditions
may arise from time to time requiring an emergency encroachment upon a county
road rights-of-way.
   (B)   An applicant in such emergency conditions may proceed with the
emergency encroachment work, provided:
      (1)   The applicant shall notify the County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch at
once and make diligent efforts to notify the Supervisor as soon as possible
concerning the situation;
      (2)   The applicant shall complete and submit the required application
for an appropriate encroachment permit on the next working day following
commencement of the encroachment work;
      (3)   The encroachment work may continue if the application has been made
unless and until the Supervisor orders the applicant to cease further
encroachment work;
      (4)   The applicant will incur no penalty with the county if an
application for encroachment has been timely and properly made as required in
this section. Otherwise, all fees will be assessed at twice the normal amount;
and
      (5)   All emergency work shall strictly comply with all standards set
forth in this subchapter.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.15 NOTICE REGARDING MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   When any maintenance is necessary on or within a county road rights-
of-way, the entity intending to engage in the maintenance work shall notify the
Supervisor in writing not later than ten working days before starting the
maintenance work.
   (B)   Within five working days following receipt of a notice referenced in
division (A) above, the Supervisor shall notify the party of the amount of any
required bond, the level of any required liability insurance and the amount of
any required fees to be deposited. No maintenance work may commence until all
required fees have been paid and the applicant has met all other requirements.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.16 FEES.
   (A)   Fees required under this ordinance shall be determined and updated
from time to time by the Supervisor, upon review and approval by the Board of
County Commissioners, with fees to be fixed in an amount reasonably calculated
to compensate the county for costs and time incurred to inspect and review the
plans for the intended encroachment, the work in progress and the completed
project. The Supervisor shall prepare and distribute an updated schedule of
fees required under this subchapter and may amend the fee schedule from time to
time upon review and approval by the County Commission as needed to reflect
changing conditions.
   (B)   All applications, fees, bonds or guarantees, insurance policies and
other documents required by this subchapter shall be delivered to the County
Road Department office, presently located at 689 West 2630 South, Richfield,
Utah 84701.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.17 MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS GENERALLY.
   (A)   New construction shall be completed according to the plans and
specifications approved in connection with an encroachment permit issued
pursuant to this subchapter.
   (B)   All construction, maintenance and repairs performed in connection with
any encroachment project on a county road rights-of-way shall comply with one
or the other of the following standards, or some combination thereof, as
determined by the Supervisor at his or her discretion, for each encroachment
project. Either the minimum standards listed in the most current edition of the
Utah Department of Transportation’s (UDOT’s) Standard Drawings and
Specifications, or the standards set forth in §§
152.18 to
152.24 of this chapter, or some combination of the referenced UDOT standards
and standards in §§
152.18 to
152.24 of this chapter, again as determined by the Supervisor.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.18 PREPARATION MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   In instances of a high-use asphalt or gravel road, boring under the
roadway shall be required whenever possible. If the pavement, sidewalk,
driveway or other surface must be cut, it shall be cut vertically along the
lines forming the trench in such a manner as to prevent damage to the adjoining
pavement or hard surfacing.
   (B)   When trenching across a paved county roadway is required, T-patches
for the asphalt will be required as follows: Saw cut edge of existing pavement.
Provide cut through full depth of pavement and in a straight line. If the
pavement is cracked, broken or deteriorated, make a cut so the defective area
is removed. Remove existing pavement that was cut off. Saw cut additional one-
foot minimum of paved surface for T-patch prior to untreated base course and
paving. (See the T-patch detail in County Standards and Asphalt Paving Repair.)
Cut shall be made at a minimum of six inches past the trench for asphalt and
concrete. The portions to be removed shall be broken up in a manner that will
not cause damage to the pavement outside the limits of the T-patch area. Any
pavement damaged by operations outside the limits of the T-patch shall be
freshly cut and replaced. All waste material resulting from the excavation
shall be removed immediately from the site of work.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.19 BACKFILL MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   Material for backfill will be of a select nature. All broken concrete,
peat, decomposed vegetation or other similar matter will not be integrated into
the backfill materials but removed entirely from the site. All backfill will be
placed in layers of not over six inches loose measure in thickness. Compaction
will be accomplished by mechanical rollers, mechanical tampers or specified
means. Material for backfilling will have optimum moisture to ensure compaction
to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench
was dug. Jetting or internal vibrating methods of compacting sand fill or
similar methods of compacting sand or similar granular-free draining materials
will be permitted as specified in the County Road Specifications and Standards.
   (B)   The density (dry) of the backfill under pavements, sidewalks, curbs or
other structures will be not less than that existing prior to excavation. The
fill shall be restored and placed in a good condition, which will prevent
settling. (See the County Road Specifications and Standards.)
   (C)   Pipe culverts must have a minimum of 12 inches of cover. If suitable
cover cannot be achieved, use flowable fill to within four inches of the top of
pavement. A minimum of four inches of asphalt or four inches of Class AA(AE)
concrete at a minimum 4,000 psi is to be placed on top of flowable fill or
other suitable cover. See the County Road Specifications requirements.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.20 SURFACE RESTORATION MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   General. All road surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways or
other hard surfaces falling in the line of the excavation which must be removed
in performance of the work shall be restored in kind by the permittee, unless
otherwise directed by the Supervisor, in accordance with County Roadway
Specifications and Standards and other applicable regulations governing the
various types of surfaces involved.
   (B)   Protection of paved surfaces. In order to avoid unnecessary damage to
paved and graveled surfaces, track equipment shall use pavement pads when
operating on or crossing paved and graveled surfaces. All outriggers or
miscellaneous gear which may compress road surfaces shall have pad protection
at points of contact.
   (C)   Time. In traffic lanes of paved roads, the excavator shall provide
temporary gravel surfaces or cold mulch in good condition immediately after
backfill has been placed and shall complete permanent repairs on the road,
sidewalk, curb, gutter, driveway and other surfaces within five days from the
date of completion of the backfill, except for periods when permanent paving
material is not available or an extension of time is granted by the Supervisor.
   (D)   Safety. The permittee shall maintain all construction or repairs at
acceptable safe standards until final repair is complete and accepted.
   (E)   Temporary repair. If temporary repair has been made on a paved road
with gravel and a permanent repair cannot be made within the time specified
above due to any of the above-mentioned conditions, then the permittee is
required to replace the gravel with cold mulch as soon as possible. The
permittee is required to monitor and maintain repairs at acceptable safe
standards until final repair is complete and accepted.
   (F)   Responsibility. The permittee shall be responsible for maintenance
costs of trenched areas across the road until the road is overlayed or
reconstructed.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.21 CONCRETE OR ASPHALT ROAD SURFACE RESTORATION MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   Temporary grade surfaces. Where excavations are made in paved areas,
the surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel surface. Gravel shall be
placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches below the bottom of the
asphalt or concrete surface. Normally, this will require six inches of gravel
for asphalt surfaces, 12 inches of gravel for concrete and a concrete base for
asphalt wearing surfaces. Gravel shall be placed in the trench at the time it
is backfilled. Temporary gravel surface shall be maintained by blading,
sprinkling, rolling and adding gravel to maintain a safe, uniform surface
satisfactory to the Supervisor until the final surface is laid. Excess material
shall be removed from the premises immediately. Material for use on temporary
gravel surfaces shall be obtained from sound, tough, durable gravel or rock
meeting the requirements for grading outlined in the County Road Specifications
for untreated base course.
   (B)   Asphalt (HMA) surfaces. The exposed edges of existing pavement shall
be primed with Type MC-1 asphalt material or better. The Supervisor shall
approve the type, grade and mixture of the asphalt to be used for road surface
replacement. The thickness shall be equal to the adjacent surface thickness but
not less than three inches. The complete surface shall not deviate more than
one-half inch between old and new work. Refer to the County Specifications for
additional mix requirements.
   (C)   Concrete surfaces. The sub-base for concrete surfaces shall be
sprinkled with clean water just before placing the concrete. Joints and
surfaces shall be made to match the original surfaces. The thickness of
concrete shall be equal to the adjacent concrete, but in no case less than six
inches thick. The Supervisor will approve the mixing, cement, water content,
proportion, placement and curing of the concrete. In no case shall the concrete
have less compressive strength than four pounds per square inch at the end of
28 days, and the classification shall be Class AA(AE).
   (D)   Maintenance. The maintenance of all concrete surfaces shall be the
responsibility of the permittee. If the concrete structure is not maintained
and interferes with the normal maintenance of the road, it will be removed at
the permittee’s expense.
   (E)   Concrete base, asphalt wearing surfaces. This type of surfacing shall
be constructed as described above.
   (F)   Gravel surfaces. Trenches excavated through gravel surfaces, such as
gravel roads, shoulders and unpaved driveways, shall have six inches of road
base gravel restored and maintained. The requirements for the road base can be
found below and in the County Standards and Specifications. The Permittee is
responsible for the maintenance of trenches across the road for one-year
minimum, and all materials and compaction shall comply with County Road
Specifications.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.22 RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   An excavator shall not interfere with any existing utility without the
written consent of the owner of the utility. If it becomes necessary to
relocate an existing utility, it shall be done by the utility’s owner unless
the owner otherwise directs. No utility, whether owned by a governmental entity
or by a private enterprise, may be moved and/or removed to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of such work shall be borne by the permittee or an
expressly written agreement is made whereby the utility owner and the excavator
make other arrangements relating to such costs. The permittee shall take
reasonable means to support and protect all conduits, poles, wires or other
apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and shall do
everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or
across the work. In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus
should be damaged (and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or
devices are to be considered as part of a substructure), they shall be repaired
by the agency or person owning them, but the utility owner shall be reimbursed
for the expense of such repairs by the permittee. It is the intent of this
section that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to
substructures, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
substructure damage, and such assumption of liability, shall be deemed a
contractual obligation which the permittee accepts upon acceptance of an
excavation permit. By state law, the permittee is required to be aware of the
existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same
against damage. The permittee shall contact Blue Stakes of Utah 8-1-1 to have
utilities in the area located before any work begins.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.23 JETTING AND BORING MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   The permittee or contractor shall not perform jetting or boring operations
of any kind without the express permission of the Supervisor, and any damage to
road surfaces or structures due to jetting or boring operations shall be
repaired to the satisfaction of the Supervisor. In cases where the Supervisor
has to perform such repairs, the Supervisor may, at his or her discretion,
charge the expenses for such to the permittee, contractor or bonding company,
or any combination thereof. Any damage to utility lines or other utility
structures due to jetting or boring shall be repaired to the satisfaction of
the utility.
(Ord. 2023-4-1, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 152.24 STREET INTERSECTION AND DRIVEWAY APPROACH SPACING MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   (A)   Unsignalized driveways. Five hundred feet or more should be provided
between full-movement unsignalized accesses, but this minimum distance
requirement may be waived if that is the only way to provide at least one such
access per each residential lot.
   (B)   Number of approaches. Residential lots shall not have more than one
driveway approach unless approved by the County Road Supervisor. For the
purposes of this division (B), circular driveways are considered as having two
access points and thus require County Road Supervisor approval.
   (C)   Proximity and width. No residential driveway shall be planned right
next to another driveway nor be more than 32 feet in width unless approved by
the County Road Supervisor. In no event shall the combined width of such
driveways exceed 48 feet or 50% of the entire lot frontage, whichever is less.
   (D)   Corner lots. On corner lots, driveways must be placed no closer to the
centerline of the intersection than 250 feet. The Road Supervisor may waive
this requirement if the frontage proposed is the only way to access the
property.
   (E)   Commercial lots and developments. Commercial lots or developments are
not limited to one access per lot and should be addressed on a case-by-case
basis, but not to exceed the access frontage requirements listed in the
following divisions. Additional accesses must be approved by the county upon
completion of a circulation plan or traffic impact study provided to the county
indicating that more than one access is required to adequately handle the
development’s traffic volumes and further indicating that the additional access
will not be detrimental to traffic flow on the adjacent street network.
Circular driveways are considered as having two access points and are subject
to the requirements of division (B) above.
   (F)   Multiple accesses. When more than one driveway access is allowed for a
property, then driveway accesses shall be in accordance with division (H)
below. Not more than two driveway accesses shall be installed per parcel. All
driveway layouts and exceptions shall be approved by county road personnel.
   (G)   Street intersection separation distances. The following are the
county’s required street intersection separation distances based on the
functional class of the roadway facility.

§ 152.28 CATTLE GUARDS.
   (A)   Any person or entity desiring to install a cattle guard on a county
road rights-of-way must file a detailed application and request for a Class 1
encroachment permit with the County Road Department. The application shall
identify the county road rights-of-way involved and the exact location of the
proposed installation, and the application shall provide designs, drawings,
plans and specifications for the same. After reviewing the application, the
Supervisor shall, within a reasonable time, either grant the same or decline
it, and if he or she declines the application, he or she shall return it to the
applicant with an attached written statement of the reasons for the decision.
The Supervisor is authorized to waive application fees for amended applications
if, in his or her opinion and at his or her sole discretion, the amended
application will not require the Supervisor to spend significant additional
time reviewing it. In cases where the Supervisor grants the application and
issues the desired encroachment permit, he or she may impose any conditions,
limits, bonds or other guarantees he or she deems necessary to protect the
county and assure the applicant’s compliance with the encroachment permit’s
terms and conditions.
   (B)   The applicant shall supply all installation materials and comply with
all material design specifications that the Supervisor may require, including,
but not limited to, concrete work, bases, re-bar, wings, fence posts and gates
and the like, as the Supervisor deems necessary. See the County Standards and
Specifications for more information.
   (C)   The applicant shall be solely responsible to install a side gate that
adequately connects any adjacent fences to the cattle guard. The minimum gate
width shall be ten feet, as shown in cattle guard standard drawings.
   (D)   The applicant shall supply the necessary labor to construct and
install the cattle guard according to current specification requirements and
the encroachment permit’s terms and conditions using materials and components
provided by the applicant at the permitted site. In no event, however, does the
county assume liability to the applicant for the applicant’s performance of the
construction.
   (E)   Upon completion of the installation, the Supervisor shall inspect the
same and, upon his or her approval and acceptance, the County Road Department
will assume responsibility for future maintenance of the unit as long as the
county road rights-of-way is part of the county road system, or until the
Supervisor deems the cattle guard is no longer functional and in need of
replacement, in which case the applicant/permittee shall be solely responsible
for replacing the cattle guard.

VACATION OF COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND UTILITY EASEMENTS
§ 152.45 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPROPRIATE COUNTY LAND USE AUTHORITY. For any process of vacating a county
road rights-of-way or county utility easement, either a county department or
office, or the County Planning and Zoning Commission, or the County Board of
Commissioners, according to which of these has the lawful authority to act at a
given stage in the process of considering and deciding on any petition, case,
transaction, decision or operation.
   CONDEMNATION OR THREAT OF CONDEMNATION. The county’s acquisition of a real
property interest through an eminent domain proceeding, or the county’s
deciding that it will authorize the use of condemnation authority to acquire
the real property or casement interest through an eminent domain proceeding.
   COUNTY or THE COUNTY. Sevier County, Utah.
   COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY. The corridor width for any county street,
highway, trail, route or road, or any segment thereof, together with all of its
appurtenant shoulders, culverts, drains and turnarounds and the like, and any
additional corridor width that constitutes the county’s rights-of-way therefor,
plus any and all other rights-of-way acquired by the county in or appurtenant
to the corridor width, all of which the county has acquired by any legal means,
including, but not limited to, conveyance, approval and recording of a
subdivision plat, construction with county resources, prescriptive use or
dedication by public use.
   COUNTY UTILITY EASEMENT. The corridor width of any county rights-of-way, or
any segment thereof, through which a utility provides by means of overhead,
surface and/or underground pipelines, ditches, wires, channels, cables or
conduits any and all public services to supply or transport gas, oil, water,
sewer, other wastewater, electricity, telecommunications, television/radio
signals and fiber optics, which rights-of-way the county has acquired by any
legal means, including, but not limited to, conveyance, approval and recording
of a subdivision plat, or means of dedication, construction with county
resources, prescriptive use or dedication by public use.
   DEDICATED RIGHTS-OF-WAY. For any given county road rights-of-way or county
utility easement, in addition to its meaning under controlling state statutory
and case law, means that a duly recorded plat, survey or related document has
been developed which contains a legal description of a county road rights-of-
way or county utility easement and which names the county as the rights-of-way
owner. Under controlling state law, a road may be dedicated to the county for
public motorized travel by, for example, mere continuous public use for the
required number of years or by construction with public funds. Therefore, the
lack of a duly recorded plat, survey or related dedicated rights-of-way
document for any given county road rights-of-way of county utility easement
does not render the county’s rights-of-way for that road invalid.
   EXISTING COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY. Any county road rights-of-way that is
recognized and approved in an ordinance passed by the County Board of
Commissioners as part of the county road system.
   EXISTING COUNTY UTILITY EASEMENT. Any county utility easement that is

conditions of an agreement to exchange real property or an interest in real
property for other real property or an interest in real property.

         (a)   Adjacent to the county road rights-of-way or county utility
easement between the two nearest public intersections;
         (b)   Accessed exclusively by the county road rights-of-way or county
utility easement; or
         (c)   Located within 300 feet of the county road rights-of-way or
county utility easement.
      (2)   A utility who provides through the county utility easement public

   PURPORTED COUNTY ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY or PURPORTED COUNTY UTILITY EASEMENT. A
road rights-of-way or utility easement to which the county’s current or
historical claim is doubtful and uncertain, and therefore, the county wishes to
invoke the vacating procedure provided in this subchapter to remove any vestige
of a claim or interest by the county to such.

across and over which, or through which, a county road rights-of-way or county
utility easement passes. Owners of SERVIENT ESTATE land may include private
individuals and entities, federal governmental entities and state or local
governmental entities. The SERVIENT ESTATE land is subject to a valid county
road rights-of-way interest or county utility easement interest.
      (2)   In some cases, the county may own both the rights-of-way interest
and the SERVIENT ESTATE interest with respect to a given county road rights-of-
way or county utility easement, or any segment thereof, and in such cases, the
county, at its sole discretion, may convey away one such interest without
conveying away the other such interest, as the county may determine on a case-
by-case basis.
   SUPERVISOR. The County Road Department Supervisor or agent whom the
Supervisor expressly authorizes to exercise the functions of the Supervisor
under this subchapter. This term does not permit reliance upon apparent
authority, apparent agency or actions by county road employees in general.

conveyance.
   (B)   When a real property interest to be conveyed away by the county was
originally acquired by the county through condemnation or threat of
condemnation, the county may not sell the real property interest on the open
market at a private or public sale unless:
      (1)   (a)   For real property, the county gives in writing the rights of
first refusal for the highest offer to the original grantor if, since the date
of the original transfer to the county, the original grantor has owned real
property adjacent to the transferred real property; or
         (b)   For an easement, the county gives in writing the rights of first
refusal for the highest offer to:
            1.   If the original grantor owns the servient estate subject to
the casement, the original grantor; or
            2.   If a subsequent bona fide purchaser owns the servient estate

segments under consideration to be vacated, then the Chairperson of the
legislative authority, upon the Supervisor’s recommendation, may authorize that

noticed petition to vacate part or all of a county road rights-of-way or county
utility easement, the legislative authority shall determine whether:
         (a)   Good cause exists for granting the petition in whole or in part;
and
         (b)   Neither the public interest nor any person will be materially
injured by the proposed vacation.
      (3)   If the legislative authority makes favorable determinations
pursuant to divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(b) above and determines to grant the

adopt an appropriate written ordinance to vacate consistent with its
determination on the petition, together with an explanation of any terms or

ordinance or court decree that vacates a county road rights-of-way or county
utility easement, or any segment thereof:
      (1)   (a)   Subject to the provisions of division (A)(1)(b) below, in
cases where the county vacates its rights-of-way interest in a given road
segment or utility corridor segment and does not have a real property interest
in the underlying servient estate, one-half of the width of the vacated segment
shall be assessed by the County Assessor to each of the adjoining landowners
for property tax purposes.
         (b)   However, notwithstanding the provisions of division (A)(1)(a)
above, should a property description of an owner of record extend into the
vacated segment or segments of a county road rights-of-way or county utility
easement, that portion of the vacated segment or segments shall be assessed by
the County Assessor to such record owner, and the remainder of the vacated
segment or segments shall be assessed as otherwise provided in division (A)(1)

when the county legislative authority vacates a county road rights-of-way or
county utility easement, any rights-of-way interest of the state is also

and county utility easement once established as belonging to the county, even
if the interruption is allowed to continue unabated.

      (2)   The rights of a culinary water authority or sanitary sewer
authority; or
      (3)   The rights of a public utility easement that is not a county

(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.021 GENERAL SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The procedure by which required writings and material shall be
submitted, reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Planning Commission and
land use authority shall be as follows.
      (1)   Should the applicant desire a concept plan review, the applicant
shall submit a concept plan to the Development Review Committee for review. At
this meeting, staff will provide information on accessing applicable land use
ordinances, a complete list of standards required for the project, preliminary
and final application checklists and feedback on the concept plan.
      (2)   The applicant shall then prepare and submit a complete application
for preliminary review. An applicant may elect to submit the preliminary and
final plat concurrently. Any application found to be incomplete shall be
returned to the applicant.
      (3)   Staff shall review a complete preliminary application within 15
calendar days of submittal and a final plat within 20 calendar days of
submittal.
      (4)   Any filing and review fees required for any stage of the
subdivision procedure shall be submitted together with all contents required in
this code.
      (4)   After staff has completed a review, staff shall provide any
corrections to the applicant. If no corrections are required, the application
shall be forwarded for review by the Planning Commission or land use authority,
as determined by the county code. Incomplete submittals or resubmittals that do
not address all corrections shall not be placed on the agenda docket for the
Planning Commission or the land use authority.
      (5)   In instances where corrections are required, the resubmittal
process shall follow the review cycles outlined in U.C.A. § 10-9a-604, as
amended. No more than four review cycles shall be permitted.
      (6)   Any approval or disapproval made by the Planning Commission shall
be in the form of written findings of fact and conclusions included in the
approved minutes of the meeting.
      (7)   Any approval or disapproval by the Planning Commission described in
this chapter may be appealed as outlined in §
153.030.
      (8)   No excavation or alteration of the terrain within a proposed
subdivision may be undertaken prior to approval of the final plat by the land
use authority, approval or disapproval in conformity with the procedures set
forth in this chapter. Excavation or alteration of the land prior to approval
of the final plat may be cause for disapproval of the proposed subdivision.
      (9)   Receipt of any document for the purposes of official Planning
Commission action shall be deemed to occur only at regularly scheduled meetings
of the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Steps in the procedure are as follows.
      (1)   Step 1: Submit concept plan (optional). Subdividers may submit a
concept plan to the Development Review Committee consisting of a representative
of the Building and Zoning Department, Health Department, County Fire
Department, Road Department and any other department the concept plan may
benefit from by having a review prior to the submission of a preliminary plat
(preliminary design plan). The concept plan shall enable the subdivider and the
Development Review Committee to have an informal review of a proposed
subdivision for general scope and conditions which might affect said
subdivision. The concept plan shall be reviewed by the Development Review
Committee under guidelines set forth in §§
153.050 and
150.051. There is no approval of a concept plan required or given. After
reviewing and discussing the concept plan, the Development Review Committee
will advise the applicant of the specific changes or additions, if any, that
are needed in the layout, and the character and extent of required improvements
and reservations which it will require as a prerequisite to the approval of the
preliminary plat. The Development Review Committee will grant the applicant the
right to move forward with authorization to prepare and submit a preliminary
plan.
      (2)   Step 2: Submit preliminary design plan. Subdividers shall submit a
preliminary design plan. The preliminary design plan shall provide design
solutions for problems identified in the review process. Submission
requirements and time required for review and notification are included in §§
153.065 through
153.070. Approval of the preliminary design plan shall be valid for 12 months.
Thereafter, approval of the preliminary design plan will have expired unless a
final plat has been submitted to the land use authority, or an extension has
been granted by the land use authority.
      (3)   Step 3: Submit final plat. Once a preliminary design plan has been
approved by the Planning Commission, the subdivider shall submit a final plat
and supporting documents. The final plat shall be reviewed by the land use
authority. Appropriate action shall be taken under the process outlined in §§
153.085 through
153.097. Once approved by the land use authority, the final plat may be
recorded, and lots may then be sold.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.022 PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND AN IMPROVEMENTS
AGREEMENT REQUIRED PRIOR TO FINAL APPROVAL OF THE LAND USE AUTHORITY.
   The land use authority shall not approve any subdivision or authorize for
recording any subdivision which has not previously received preliminary
approval by the Planning Commission, nor shall it approve and authorize such
subdivision for recording unless an improvement agreement with regard to the
subject subdivision has been signed by all appropriate parties. The
improvements agreement shall then also be recorded.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.023 APPROVAL OF LAND USE AUTHORITY.
   The land use authority shall grant approval for any subdivision only after a
subdivider has complied with the process outlined in this chapter. Intermediate
approval at each phase of the process shall not be construed to mean final
approval of the subdivision.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.024 LIMITED RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION.
   All subdivision applications to the county for limited residential
subdivision require an alternative process for subdivision approval.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.025 DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAND USE AUTHORITY.
   The County Zoning Administrator is designated as the administrative land use
authority as defined by §
154.003. However, in instances where a final plat is reviewed concurrently with
a preliminary plan, the Planning Commission may act as the land use authority
for both the preliminary and final plat. In instances where the approval is
concurrent with a legislative action, such as a zone change, text amendment or
General Plan amendment, the County Commission may act as the land use
authority.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.026 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAND USE AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The land use authority shall have the powers and duties described in
the County Land Use, Development and Management Act (“Act”), as currently set
forth in U.C.A. Title 17, Chapter 27a, as amended, or as that Act may be
amended.
   (B)   Subject to and in accordance with the Act and this chapter, the land

for the subdivision of unincorporated land;
      (3)   Consider, approve or disapprove an application for the proposed
subdivision of unincorporated land into ten or less lots without a plat;
      (4)   With or without a petition, consider and resolve any proposed
vacation, alteration or amendment of a subdivision plat, any portion of a
subdivision plat or any street, lot or alley contained in a subdivision plat
except to the extent that any action on these matters is required to be taken
by the County Commission;
      (5)   Refuse to approve or renew any plat, subdivision plan or dedication
of any street or other ground, if restrictions, covenants or similar binding
agreements running with the land prohibit or unreasonably restrict reasonably
sited and designed solar collectors, clotheslines or other energy devices based
on renewable sources from being installed on buildings or erected on lots
within the subdivision;
      (6)   Exercise such other powers and duties as may be delegated to it by
the County Commission; and
      (7)   The procedure by which required writings and material shall be
submitted, reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Planning Commission
shall be in accordance with §
153.021.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.027 LIMITED RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Review; notice initial review.
      (1)   After receiving an application for preliminary subdivision plan or
final plat review, the land use authority shall determine whether the
application is complete or not. If the land use authority finds the application
is not complete, the land use authority shall inform the applicant in writing
of the missing items. The application shall not be reviewed until the
application is complete.
      (2)   Once the land use authority finds the application is complete, the
land use authority shall distribute copies of the plans to the following
officials and reviewing agencies for the information and recommendation of such
officials, divisions and agencies: the County Engineer, Building Services
Division, the Water Utility, the Operations Division, the Fire Department, the
Police Department and the County Attorney; the school district and the United
States Postal Service; each company or agency furnishing culinary water,
sanitary sewer or storm sewer, if such services are proposed to be provided by
other than the county; and each company or agency furnishing electric, gas,
telephone, cable services or secondary water.
      (3)   The land use authority shall consider all comments received,
complete an initial review of the subdivision preliminary plan and provide
comments and corrections to the applicant. In the case of limited residential
subdivisions in areas that do not contain geologic hazards, such review shall
be completed and provided to the applicant within 15 business days of the date
the application was complete.
      (4)   If after the initial review the land use authority determines that
no major changes are required to be made to the submittal, the land use
authority shall schedule the proposed subdivision for review.
      (5)   If the land use authority determines revisions are required to be
made to the proposed preliminary subdivision plan to meet minimum requirements
and criteria for preliminary subdivision plan approval, and if such revisions
may result in major changes to the proposed preliminary subdivision plan, the
subdivider shall make such changes prior to the preliminary plat subdivision
plan being scheduled for review by the decision maker.
   (B)   Concept plan. There is no requirement for concept plan review or
approval. An applicant may request a concept review as outlined in §
153.021. The review shall not be binding on the county or entitle any part of
the concept plan.
   (C)   Review. Upon receipt of all required writings, fees and materials for
any specific stage of the subdivision procedure, the land use authority shall
docket the subdivider’s application for review. Incomplete submittals shall not
be placed on the agenda docketed for Planning Commission review, if applicable.
      (1)   Any approval or disapproval made by the land use authority shall be
in the form of written findings of fact and conclusions included in the
approved minutes of the meeting.
      (2)   Any approval or disapproval by the land use authority described in
this chapter may be appealed as outlined in §
153.030.
      (3)   No excavation or alteration of the terrain within a proposed
subdivision may be undertaken prior to approval of the final plat by the County
Commission, approval or disapproval in conformity with the procedures set forth
in this chapter; excavation or alteration of the land prior to approval of the
final plat may be cause for disapproval of the proposed subdivision.
      (4)   Receipt of any document for the purposes of official land use
authority action shall be deemed to occur only at regularly scheduled meetings
of the land use authority.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.028 APPROVAL OF THE LAND USE AUTHORITY AND AN IMPROVEMENTS AGREEMENT
REQUIRED PRIOR TO FINAL PLAT.
   The land use authority shall not approve any subdivision or authorize for

subject subdivision has been signed by all appropriate parties. The
improvements agreement shall then also be recorded.
(Ord. 2024-5-2, passed 5-13-2024)
§ 153.029 APPROVAL OF LAND USE AUTHORITY.

Recreation   and wildlife purposes. In general, this zone covers the open
and Forestry portion of the county which is occupied largely by grazing land,
Residential  mountains and canyons.
Zone
GRF-20S -    The primary use of the land for grazing, recreational, forestry
Grazing,     and wildlife purposes. This zone covers the open portion of the

Industrial   manufacturing, processing, warehousing and fabrication of goods
Zone         and material can be carried on with minimum conflict or
             deleterious effect upon the surrounding properties.
PUD -        This zone is to provide for uses not found in other zoning
Planned Unit districts within the county consistent with the county’s General
Development  Plan.
Zone
             The primary use of land is for dwelling purposes, by ensuring the
             orderly and timely conversion of certain open land areas within
RA -         the county into residential districts as the need for such land
Residential- occurs. Any permitted improvements will be required to request
Agricultural annexation from the nearest municipality. If the application is
Zone         denied by the nearest municipality and not allowed to connect to
             sewer and water from the municipality, standards outlined in

§ 154.076 ANNEXATIONS.
   (A)   Annexation policy. The county policy is to encourage and/or require
development near existing municipalities, promoting annexation into areas with
available utility services. The county supports annexation to existing cities
and towns and advises incorporation for communities located away from such
areas. Plans for annexation should align with established policy, and
applicants must adhere to U.C.A. § 10-2-403 for annexation requirements and
procedures.
   (B)   Procedure for annexation. Upon receiving an annexation petition, the
applicant shall be directed to the nearest municipality if within 600 feet. The
petitioner must have the municipality complete the county’s “Municipal
Annexation/Service Request Form” for further development. The municipality
reviews the form within 60 days, with an optional 30-day extension if needed,
after which the petitioner can proceed with the county.
   (C)   Required coordination. In addition to standard subdivision application
information, lands contiguous to a municipality must notify the legislative
body of the adjacent municipality(ies). If the municipality indicates
willingness to consider annexation, the applicant must present an annexation
petition, and the county cannot consider subdivision approval until six months
after notification to allow for annexation petition filing. CONTIGUOUS is
defined as having a common property boundary of equal to or greater than 50
feet; properties separated by a right-of-way shall be construed to be
CONTIGUOUS.

street or land survey lines, said street or land survey lines shall be
construed to be the zone boundaries. Where the indicated boundaries are
approximately canal, natural streams or watercourses, the center of said canal,
natural streams or watercourses shall be construed to be the zone boundaries.
      (2)   In the absence of any street, land survey, natural stream or
watercourse forming the boundaries of any zone, the scale of measurement shown
on the map shall be used to determine the zone boundary line.
   (B)   Where uncertainty exists, the Board of County Commissioners shall
interpret the map.
   (C)   The Residential Agricultural Zone will maintain a 600-foot wide zone
around the boundaries of cities and towns. When an annexation occurs within the
600-foot buffer into a city or town, the Residential Agricultural Zone will be
adjusted to reflect a constant 600-foot buffer.

§ 154.141 TABLE OF USES.
   Uses designated in the land use matrix as Zoning Administrator (ZA),
Planning Commission (PC) and County Commissioners (CC) are conditional uses
that require special consideration by the land use authority. The purpose of
this subchapter is to allow the most appropriate level of land use authority to
evaluate the reasonable conditions to mitigate potential negative effects of
the proposed use on a case-by-case situation. The conditional use permit
process allows the Zoning Administrator (ZA), the Planning Commission (PC) or
the County Commission (CC) to approve, conditionally approve or deny requests
for a conditional use permit. All permits shall begin with the Zoning
Administrator (ZA), and progress to the level listed below before the permit is
issued. If a use is permitted (P) within a certain zone, no approval is needed
from the county to carry out that use, excluding potential building inspection
or Health Department approvals and the like. Uses which are not specifically
permitted within a zone are prohibited (N).

   (C)   If the County Planning and Zoning Department receives five written
complaints from different aggrieved persons within three calendar years
immediately preceding the twentieth calendar year after an agriculture
protection area or any portion thereof is created or reauthorized, or
alternatively the county legislative body determines that after the initial
review that the agriculture protection area should be modified or terminated,
or within 30 days of land in an agriculture protection area being annexed, then
the County Planning and Zoning Department shall, for that agriculture
protection area:
      (1)   Request the Planning Commission and Advisory Board to submit
recommendations about whether the agriculture protection area should be
continued, modified or terminated;
      (2)   Schedule the county legislative body to, at least 120 days before

that the agricultural protection area should be continued or otherwise fails to
affirmatively continue, modify or terminate the agriculture protection area in
the twentieth calendar year, within 120 days of an applicable annexation, then
the agriculture protection area is considered to be reauthorized for another 20
years. The time required for action is continued provided the county
legislative body continues the matter to a date certain, and the legislative

§ 154.180 PROTECTION OF LAND IN AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION AREA.
   (A)   Land in an agriculture protection area shall be protected as provided
in U.C.A. Title 17, Chapter 41, Part 4.
   (B)   Local regulations of general applicability, enacted after land is
added to an agricultural protection area, shall apply to land in an agriculture
protection area, and shall be presumed to bear a direct relationship to public
health or safety, and to not unreasonably restrict farm structures or farm
practices. If a property owner seeks to be exempt from local regulations of
general applicability, the property owner shall bear the burden of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that the regulation does not bear a direct
relationship to public health or safety, and that it unreasonably restricts
farm structures or farm practices, using the statement outlined in division (E)
below.
   (C)   Local regulations, including zoning regulations, that only effect the
A Zone or land in agriculture protection areas, which are enacted after land is
added to an agricultural protection area, are presumed to be applicable to land
in agriculture protection areas. If a property owner seeks to be exempt from
such local land use regulations, including zoning regulations, the property
owner shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
they are exempt from the regulation under U.C.A. Title 17, Chapter 41, Part 4,
using the statement outlined in division (E) below.
   (D)   Land within an agriculture protection area that is changed from A-1 to
another zoning designation shall be presumed to remain subject to the zoning
designation in effect when the land was added to an agriculture protection
area. The property owner shall follow the statement outlined in division (E)
below to let the land use authority know of the exemption, and then the land
use authority shall bear the burden of proving by the preponderance of the
evidence that the land is subject to the new zoning designation at issue. If
the A Zone is dissolved or called by another name, the land shall be considered
part of the zoning designation which is functionally the closest to the A Zone,
and the property owner may seek exemption from individual local regulations,
including zoning regulations, using the procedure outlined in division (E)
below.
   (E)   If a property owner desires to have a local law, ordinance or
regulation, including a zoning regulation or zoning designation, not apply to
land in the agricultural protection area because its applicability is limited
by U.C.A. Title 17, Chapter 41, Part 4, the property owner shall submit a
statement with any applicable land use application indicating:
      (1)   What regulation is not applicable to the land;
      (2)   When the regulation was enacted;
      (3)   What alternative regulation is applicable, if any;
      (4)   When the land was added to an agriculture protection area, and a
statement that the land is still in an agriculture protection area;
      (5)   How the enactment or application of the land use regulation to the
land is prohibited by U.C.A. Title 17, Chapter 41, Part 4; and
      (6)   Any other information reasonably requested by the Planning and
Zoning Department or the legislative body.
   (F)   The applicability of the local land use regulations, laws, ordinances
or regulations shall be determined by the land use authority as part of the
approval or denial of the associated land use application. Any appeals shall be
made using the processes for an appeal of the associated land use decision.
Determinations shall be made on an individual land use application basis, and
determinations shall not be applicable to other land use applications.
   (G)   Any complaints of violations of the land use and development code for
property in an agriculture protection area may be required by the Planning and
Zoning Department to demonstrate that the alleged violation would not be
afforded protection due to the property’s status in an agriculture protection
area in order to be considered for an enforcement action. Nevertheless, the
Planning and Zoning Department retains sole discretion on whether or not to
bring an enforcement action by the Planning and Zoning Department.

      (2)   AFOs consisting of dead animals, manure storage or other operations
with excessive air emissions and/or negative impacts to air and water quality
resource concerns shall be subject to the requirements of division (A)(1)
above.
      (3)   (a)   1.   Any CAFO or AFO as outlined in division (A)(2) above
shall satisfy the requirements of the county CAFO application prior to approval
of the County Planning Commission and County Commission.
            2.   The application shall consist of an overall development plan
including:
               a.   The distance from existing dwellings and municipal
boundaries;
               b.   The number and type of animal units;
               c.   A completed CNMP; and
               d.   A mitigation plan addressing negative impacts to adjacent
property values, local residents’ quality of life and how the CAFO plans to
mitigate said impacts.
         (b)   If a CAFO consists of multiple individuals and/or entities, all
individuals and/or entities shall be included in one CAFO Application and
divisions (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3) and (A)(4) shall include the entire operation.
      (4)   CAFO and AFO operations must comply with divisions (A)(1), (A)(2)
and (A)(3) above and the following.
         (a)   Prevailing wind provision. Upon showing by a conditional use
permit applicant, the Planning Commission, by convincing evidence that there is
a historical prevailing wind, may off-set the separation distance sphere by as
much as 50%. However, the off-sets shall not decrease the area within the
separation distance. The shape and size of the separation area shall remain
constant. This provision allows only for the shifting of the separation area
sphere to the downwind direction by as much as 50%.
         (b)   Public health, safety, welfare and water/air quality. CAFO
operation owners must take actions to minimize water/air pollution and public
health and safety impacts from confinement and waste treatment facilities. To
accomplish this goal and as part of the conditional use permit required by all
CAFO and AFO operations, the CAFO operation owner shall be required to develop
and implement technically sound, economically feasible and site-specific
comprehensive nutrient management plans (CNMPs) in accordance with the latest
technical guidance of the natural resources conservation service. Additionally,
CAFO operations shall be required to obtain a state pollutant discharge
elimination system (UPDES) general approval for concentrated animal feeding
operations (Permit No. UTG080000), issued by the State Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ). In the event that the State Department of
Environmental Quality is unable or unwilling to accept a UPDES permit
application, the County Planning Commission shall require as a condition of the
conditional use permit, standards equal to that required by UPDES Permit No.
UTG080000 and reviewed by an engineer selected and agreed upon mutually by the
applicant and the County Planning Commission, and paid for by the applicant.
All CAFO operations shall prepare a “Best Management Plan for Odor Control,”
required by this chapter, as part of the CUP application process. All CAFO
operations must use the best wastewater treatment technology available at the
time of permitting to protect the public health, safety, welfare and water/air
quality. Best wastewater treatment technology puts primary emphasis on the
prevention of groundwater contamination, control of air contaminants and odors.
The county recognizes that the swine industry, government and society are
taking steps to develop and implement new technology that will protect the
environment and the economy. The county has determined that open-air anaerobic
lagoons are not considered adequate wastewater treatment technology for large
swine operations. The intent of this provision is to require superior waste
disposal technologies to be described as “best available technology” as
accepted by the State Department of Environmental Quality.
   (B)   The County Planning Commission and County Commission shall approve a
CAFO application if said application satisfies all the requirements of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 2022, passed - -)

Commissioners. Appeals shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Clerk’s
Office not more than 30 days after the decision by the Planning Commission. The
County Commission may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Planning
Commission. Appeal review by the Board of County Commissioners shall be
recorded in an open public meeting. County Commission decisions shall be final.
(Ord. 2022, passed - -)
§ 154.310 PERMITS AND FEES.
   (A)   Permits. From the effective date of this subchapter, the Zoning
Administrator shall not grant a permit, nor shall any officer of the county
grant any license or permit for the use of any land or the construction or
alteration of any building or structure on a parcel which would be in violation
of any provisions of this subchapter, or this chapter until the CAFO
application has been approved as required by this subchapter. Any license or
permit issued in conflict with such provisions shall be null and void.
   (B)   Fees. At the time of filing, a non-refundable fee shall be submitted,
payable to the county, in accordance with the currently adopted fee schedule as
adopted by the County Commission by resolution. Outside of any cost or fee
resulting from a CAFO application, including, but not limited to, inspections,
surveys, studies and the like, shall be the responsibility of the CAFO
applicant.
(Ord. 2022, passed - -)
§ 154.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee
or otherwise, who shall erect, construct or reconstruct or alter any building
or structure in any zone of the unincorporated area of the county without first
obtaining the appropriate permit from the County Building Inspector shall be
guilty of a Class C misdemeanor, and any person, firm or corporation, whether

violation is committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm or
corporation and shall be punishable as provided by law as a separate offense.
   (C)   Any person who is found guilty of violating any of §§
154.305 through
154.310, either by failing to do those acts required herein or by doing a
prohibited act, is guilty of an infraction. Each day such violation is
committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate violation.
