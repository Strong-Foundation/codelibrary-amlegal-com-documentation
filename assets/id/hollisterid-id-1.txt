§ 152.08  VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Council may grant a variance from the provisions of this chapter
on a finding that undue hardship may result from strict compliance with
specific provisions or requirements of this chapter or that application of such
provisions or requirements is impractical. It must be shown that strict
compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in extraordinary
hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, other physical
conditions or other such conditions, which are not self-inflicted, or that
these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives
of this chapter, the Council may declare that variance, modification or a
waiver of these requirements be granted.
   (B)   The Council shall only recommend variances that it deems necessary to
or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the Council shall
take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use
of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the
Council finds, after a public hearing:
      (1)   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
clearly be impracticable, or unreasonable; in such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his or her reasons in writing to the specific provisions or
requirements involved;
      (2)   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated;
      (3)   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code;
and
      (4)   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of this chapter and the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
(Ord. passed 9-11-1995)

permit.
      (2)   In the event the Council shall approve and amendment, such
amendment shall thereafter be made a part of this chapter upon the preparation
and passage of an ordinance.

been denied by the Council shall be resubmitted in either substantially the
same form or with reference to substantially the same premises for the same
purposes within a period of six months from the date of such final action;

SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT SUBDIVISIONS
§ 152.65  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to identify the various types of special
developments that normally pose special concerns to the Council and elected
officials when reviewing and acting upon subdivision requests. Therefore, this
subchapter outlines the general plan submittal requirements and design
standards that shall be taken into consideration when acting on special
developments. The provisions of this subchapter are in addition to the plan
requirements and design standards that are required by §§
152.25 through
152.28 and

within a floodplain, the developer shall provide the Council with a development
plan of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will show and explain
at least the following:
         (a)   Location of all planned improvements;
         (b)   The location of the floodway and the floodway fringe per
engineering practices as specified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA);

construction or substantial improvements of non-residential structures, the
lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated to or above the level of
the 100-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
shall be flood-proofed up to the level of the 100-year flood.
   (B)   Justification for development.
      (1)   Upon the determination that buildings are planned within the
floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated within the
floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer shall
demonstrate conclusively to the Council that such development will not present
a hazard to life, limb or property; will not have adverse effects on the
safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage channel or the natural
environment.
      (2)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If any
part of a proposed subdivision can be safely developed, the Council shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development proceed consistent
with that determination.
      (3)   Subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that:
         (a)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize

   (C)   Abandonment. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a
continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. Time may be
extended upon review and approval of the county’s Planning and Zoning
Department, if the tower owner demonstrates a good faith effort to secure new
tenants. In such circumstances, the following shall apply.
      (1)   The owner of such antenna or tower shall remove said antenna and/or
tower including all supporting equipment and building(s) within 90 days of
receipt of notice from the Planning and Zoning Department notifying the owner
of such abandonment. If removal to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning
Department does not occur within said 90 days, the County Board may order
removal utilizing the established bond and salvage said antenna or tower and
all supporting equipment and building(s). If there are two or more users of a
single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all
operations of the tower cease.
      (2)   The recipient of a conditional use permit for a telecommunications
facility under this subchapter shall notify the Planning and Zoning Department
when the facility is no longer in operation.
(Ord. 11-05-2009, passed 11-5-2009)
§ 153.42  STRUCTURAL, DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Tower, antenna and facilities requirements. All telecommunication
facilities shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment to the
greatest extent feasible. To this end, all of the following measures shall be
implemented:
      (1)   All telecommunication facilities shall comply at all times with all
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules, regulations, and standards. To
that end no telecommunication facility or combination of facilities shall
produce at any time power densities in any inhabited area that exceed the
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) adopted standard for human exposure, as
amended, or any more restrictive standard subsequently adopted or promulgated
by the federal government. All telecommunication towers and antennas shall meet
or exceed the standards and regulations, in place at the time of the issuance
of the conditional use permit, of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
the Idaho State Bureau of Aeronautics, Occupational Safety And Health
Association (OSHA), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and authority to
regulate towers and antennas.
      (2)   Telecommunication towers shall be constructed out of metal or other
nonflammable material, unless specifically permitted.
      (3)   All ground mounted telecommunication towers shall be self-
supporting monopoles or lattice towers except where satisfactory evidence is
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission that a guyed tower is required.
      (4)   Satellite dish and parabolic antennas shall be situated as close to
the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their
function.
      (5)   Telecommunication support facilities (such as, equipment rooms,
utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of nonreflective
materials (visible exterior surfaces only). Telecommunication support
facilities shall be no taller than one story, 15 feet in height, measured from
the original grade at the base of the facility to the top of the structure, and
shall be designed to blend with existing architecture in the area or shall be
screened from sight by mature landscaping, and shall be located or designed to
minimize their visibility.
      (6)   Telecommunications towers, facilities and antennas shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the international building code,
other applicable state and federal requirements.
      (7)   The maximum height of an antenna platform located on a rooftop
shall be 20 feet above the roof.
      (8)   Telecommunication facilities shall not interfere with or obstruct
existing or proposed public safety, fire protection or supervisory controlled
automated data acquisition (SCADA) operation telecommunication facilities. The
applicant at no cost to the county shall correct any actual interference and/or
obstruction.
   (B)   Height. The height of a telecommunication tower shall be measured from
the original grade at the base of said tower to the highest part of the tower
itself. In the case of building mounted towers the height of the tower includes
the height of the portion of the building on which it is mounted. In the case
of “crankup” or other similar towers whose height can be adjusted, the height
of the tower shall be the maximum height to which it is capable of being
raised.
   (C)   Lighting. Telecommunication towers shall not be artificially lighted
unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other
applicable regulatory authority.
   (D)   Site development, roads and parking.
      (1)   A leased parcel intended for the location of new telecommunication
tower(s) and equipment building(s) shall maintain a minimum parcel size of
2,500 square feet. The county’s Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the
leased parcel size requirement after public hearing and review.
      (2)   A parcel owned by the telecommunication carrier and/or provider and
intended for the location of new telecommunication tower(s) and equipment
building(s) shall meet the minimum size requirement of this subchapter.
      (3)   All sites must be served by a minimum 25-foot wide easement with a
turnaround. The county’s Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the easement
and turnaround requirement after public hearing and review. All sites shall use
existing access points and roads whenever possible. The respective county
highway district or the applicable road jurisdiction shall approve the access
point to the site.
   (E)   Vegetation protection and facility screening.
      (1)   All telecommunications facilities shall be installed in such a
manner so as to minimize disturbance to existing native vegetation and shall
include suitable mature landscaping to screen the facility, where necessary.
For purposes of this section, MATURE LANDSCAPING shall mean trees, shrubs or
other vegetation of a size that will provide the appropriate level of visual
screening immediately upon installation.
      (2)   Upon project completion, the owner(s)/operator(s) of the facility
shall be responsible for maintenance and replacement of all required
landscaping.
      (3)   Facility structures and equipment, including supporting structures,
shall be located, designed and screened to blend with the existing natural or
built surroundings, so as to reduce visual impacts.
   (F)   Fire prevention. All telecommunication facilities shall be designed
and operated in accordance with all applicable codes regarding fire prevention.
   (G)   Noise and traffic. All telecommunication facilities shall be
constructed and operated in such a manner as to minimize the amount of
disruption caused to nearby properties. To that end, all the following measures
shall be implemented for telecommunication facilities.
      (1)   Noise producing construction activities shall only take place
Monday through Saturday, (non-holidays) between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00
p.m., except in times of emergency repair.
      (2)   Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages and
for testing and maintenance purposes.
(Ord. 11-05-2009, passed 11-5-2009)
