any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or
claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any

(Ord. 2-2018, 10-8-2018)
7-1-2: SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL:
   A.   Removal Required: Every owner, tenant or occupant of any private or
public premises or building, and the owner or proprietor, lessee, or person
entitled to the possession of any vacant lot or block within the limits of the
City shall, during the winter season and during the time the snow shall remain
on the ground, clear the sidewalks abutting on such premises of snow and ice
and shall keep them conveniently free therefrom during the day.
   B.   Placement Of Snow Removed From Sidewalks:
      1.   Streets, Gutters And Other City Properties: Unless otherwise
provided, snow removed from sidewalks, parking areas or private properties
located inside or outside the City, shall not be thrown, shoveled or placed in
the streets, gutters, sidewalks, public parks or on other properties owned by
the City.
      2.   Large Heavy Machines: Large heavy machines such as but not limited
to backhoes, large tractors and automobiles with snow plows are prohibited from
clearing snow on public sidewalks. Machines with steel cleated tracks,
caterpillar tracks, wheel chains or studs are prohibited from being on public
sidewalks. Walk behind snow blowers with chains are permitted on public
sidewalks.
      3.   Property Of Another: Snow removed from any property, residential or
commercial, shall not be placed on the property of another property owner
without the permission of said property owner, nor shall snow be thrown,

7-1-4: MAILBOXES AND NEWSPAPER DELIVERY BOXES IN CITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY:
   A.   No mailbox or newspaper delivery box, (hereafter referred to as
mailbox) will be allowed to exist on the city's rights-of-way or interfere with
the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation
of the street system. The city does not allow new mailboxes to be installed
within city maintained public rights-of-way (ROW), because it is impractical
for property owners to keep mailbox clear of snow during the winter plow season
when city plow operations are occurring twenty-four-seven (24/7). Mailboxes
inevitably get damaged by snow plowing activities. These issues result in the
USPS being unable to deliver mail in a timely consistent manner. The following
exceptions apply:
      1.   If a property owner/mail customer can install the mailbox in an area
inside the owner's property (not in the city ROW) without obstructing any city
ROW, easements, or maintenance activities;
      2.   Does not require the delivery vehicle to access the mailbox via the
roadside of a city street; and
      3.   Gets approval from the USPS Cambridge Postmaster confirming that
they will deliver to this mailbox located on private property, then that is
acceptable and no city permitting is required. (Example: condominium HOA
installs a group mailbox within the complex's parking lot or private driveway).
      4.   Existing mailboxes located and accessed by USPS delivery vehicles on
city streets and ROWs are allowed, provided they do not create a snow plowing
or safety issue. If the location of an existing mailbox is deemed to be a
safety issue or creates an undue burden on the city's snow plowing activities,
that existing mailbox may be required to be removed from the city's ROW.
      5.   A new mailbox that is proposed to be co-located on an already
existing mailbox post that is recognized by the Public Works Department. No
city permitting is required for co-locate installation on an existing mailbox
post.
      6.   Requests for mailboxes to be located on private streets or public
streets that are outside the city limits need to be approved by the HOA or
other entity (i.e., Washington County) that has management control over the
street in addition to the USPS Cambridge Postmaster. No city permitting is
required for mailbox installations on private roads.
   B.   A mailbox installation that does not conform to the provisions of this
section is an unauthorized encroachment under Idaho Code, §49-221(2); §50-313;
or §50-314.
   C.   The location and construction of mailboxes shall conform to the rules
and regulations of the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the Manual for the
Location, Support and Mounting of Mailboxes adopted by the city. A mailbox
installation conforming with the Local Highway Technical Assistance Council
Manual for the Location, Support and Mounting of Mailboxes, dated December
2020, (hereafter referred to as Mailbox Manual) will be considered acceptable.
Mailbox location, height, support, mounting and turnout construction shall be
in accordance with the Mailbox Manual. Any exceptions to the Mailbox Manual may
be granted, if in the judgment of the city, the installation does not interfere
with the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or the
operation of the street system. Requests for any exception to the Mailbox
Manual shall be made in writing. The request shall contain sufficient details
to evaluate the requested exception.
      1.   Location: It will be the responsibility of the postal patron to
inform the city of any new or existing mailbox installation where turnout
construction is inadequate to permit all-weather access to the mailbox. An all-
weather turnout is sufficiently stable to support passenger cars stopping
regularly during all weather conditions. The sub-base (ballast), base and
surface treatment is a requirement of all new or reconstructed turnouts, and
shall be the same as the adjacent roadway section. No mailbox will be permitted
where access is obtained from the lanes of an arterial or where access is
otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. Where a mailbox is installed in the
vicinity of an existing guardrail, it should, whenever practical, be placed
behind the guardrail. Exceptions to the lateral placement criteria may exist on
residential streets and certain designated rural roads where the city deems it
is in the public's interest to permit lesser clearances or to require greater
clearances.
      2.   Mailboxes: Mailboxes shall be of light metal or plastic
construction, conforming to the requirements of the U.S. Postal Service.
Newspaper delivery boxes shall be of light sheet metal or plastic construction
of minimum dimensions suitable for holding a newspaper.
      3.   Supports: Mailbox supports shall not be set in concrete, unless the
support design has been shown to be safe by crash tests when so installed. A
metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plate, but it may have an anti-
twist device (stabilizer fin) that extends no more than ten (10) inches below
the ground surface.
      4.   Mounting: The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient
strength to prevent the box from separating from the post if the installation
is struck by a vehicle. The product must result in a satisfactory attachment of
the mailbox to the post, and all components must fit together properly.
   D.   Removal Of Non-Conforming Or Unsafe Mailboxes: Any mailbox found to
violate the intent of this regulation shall be removed by the postal patron
upon notification by the city. At the discretion of the city, based on an
assessment of hazard to the public, the patron will be granted not less than
twenty-four (24) hours or more than fifteen (15) days, to remove an
unacceptable mailbox. After the specified removal period has expired, the
unacceptable mailbox will be removed by the city at the postal patron's
expense.
(Ord. 3-2024, 5-28-2024)
7-1-5: PENALTY:
   Any person violating the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of an
infraction and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine as provided in
section
1-4-1  of this Code.

or maintain backflow prevention assemblies, the certified backflow technicians,
surveyors or repair persons will have the following responsibilities:
      1.   Ensuring acceptable testing equipment and procedures are used for
testing, repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies.
      2.   Make sure of such testing and/or repair to the consumer and water
purveyor.
      3.   The report shall include the list of materials or replacement parts
used.
      4.   Ensuring replacement parts are equal in quality to parts originally
supplied by the manufacturer of the assembly being repaired.

high hazard air gap, showing the serial number, date tested and by whom.
   B.   In the case of a consumer requiring a commercially available
technician, any certified technician is authorized to make the test and report
the results of that test to the consumer and water purveyor. (Ord. 5-2007, 7-9-
2007)
8-3-7: POLICY:
   A.   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the public water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by state laws, regulations, codes, and this chapter. Service of water
to a consumer found to be in violation of this chapter shall be discontinued by
the water purveyor after due process of written notification of violation and
an appropriate time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:
      1.   A backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter for control
of backflow and cross connections is not installed, tested, and maintained, or
      2.   It is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or
bypassed, or
      3.   An unprotected cross connection exists on the premises, or
      4.   The periodic system survey has not been conducted.
Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
   B.   The customer's system(s) shall be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether
cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation
of this chapter exist and to audit the results of the required survey.
   C.   Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection's water
usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow
prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified
consumer's water system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside
the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line
leading off the service line.
   D.   The type of protective assembly required under subsection C of this
section, shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists at the point of
cross connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to local and state
requirements or resulting from the required survey.
   E.   Pressure vacuum breakers cannot be used as backflow protection unless
the entire water service on the consumer's property, including irrigation
systems, is installed so that winterization is never required. In addition,
assurances must be made, and accepted by the public water purveyor, that
compressed air will never be introduced into the water system. Atmospheric
vacuum breakers are never allowed.
   F.   All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies, except
atmospheric vacuum breakers, which do not meet the requirements of this section
but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of
installation and maintenance requirements under this section, shall be excluded
from the requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is assured
that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Atmospheric
vacuum breakers will be replaced with an approved backflow assembly within one
year from the date this chapter is in full force and effect. Whenever the
existing assembly is moved from the present location or, requires more than
minimum maintenance or, when the water purveyor finds that the operation or
maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be
replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and
state requirements.
   G.   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where
backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified survey/
inspections, and operational tests made at least once per year at the
consumer's expense. In those instances where the public water purveyor deems
the hazard to be great, he may require certified surveys/inspections and test
at a more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the public water purveyor
to see that these tests are made according to standards set forth by the state
and local regulations.
   H.   No backflow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a
safety hazard. Example: installed over an electrical panel, steam pipes,
boilers, pits, or above ceiling level. (Ord. 5-2007, 7-9-2007)
8-3-8: VIOLATIONS:
If violations of this chapter exist, or if there has not been any corrective
action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days of the written notification
of deficiencies noted within the survey, then the public water purveyors shall
deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical
break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in
conformance with the state and local statutes relating to plumbing, safe
drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 5-

12-1-1: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental service, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood
damage, also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
12-1-2: PURPOSE, SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION:
   A.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
      1.   To protect human life and health;
      2.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
      3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazards;
      6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      7.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
   B.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purpose,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      1.   Prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities; (Ord. 3-2009, 5-11-2009)
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
   C.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
12-1-3: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES: Low cost buildings that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet, such as detached two (2) car garages, boathouses, small pole barns
and storage sheds (should be classified as minimum investment to be determined
by the community), not to be used for human habitation, shall be constructed
and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow
of floodwaters; shall be anchored to prevent flotation which may result in
damage to other structures; service utilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed. (If the community's ordinance does
not contain the above provisions for accessory structures, then a variance will
be needed to be issued to exempt accessory structures from the first floor
elevation or floodproofing requirement.)
APPEAL: A request for a review of the city of Cambridge planning and zoning
administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request
for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one foot (1') to three feet
(3'); a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is
characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letter A or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equalled or
exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "100-year flood".
Designation on maps always includes the letter A or V.
BASEMENT: The portion of a building with its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard and permanent storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The official form (FEMA form 81-31) used to track
development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with
community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance
premium rate with section B completed by community officials.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
insurance administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance
administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map,
and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION: An elevation that shall correspond to the elevation
of the one percent (1%) chance flood (100-year flood) plus any increased flood
elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any required freeboard.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
"Floodway" is the channel of the river or stream and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge and store the floodwater
or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE: A flood insurance claim payment up to thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000.00) directly to a property owner for the cost to
comply with floodplain management regulations after a direct physical loss
caused by a flood. Eligibility for an ICC claim can be through a single
instance of "substantial damage" or as a result of "cumulative substantial
damage". (More information can be found in FEMA ICC manual 301.)
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements found in subsection 12-1-7-2A2 of
this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For floodplain
management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home"
does not include park trailers and recreational vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more lots or spaces for the placement of manufactured
homes for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date hereof.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis,
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known
to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular
stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based
upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed
or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In
inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one
hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent
(1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before damage occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The market value of the building should be: a) the appraised value
of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or b)
in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" occurs when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences regardless if the alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building. The term does not include: a) a project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or b) alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

12-1-4: LAND TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
12-1-5: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD 1 :
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency
management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) For Washington County, Idaho And Incorporated Areas"
dated June 16, 2009, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and
other supporting data, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this
chapter. The FIS and the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) are on file at city
hall, Cambridge, Idaho. Special flood hazard areas may include areas that have
been known to flood historically or that have been defined through standard
engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet
incorporated in an FIS. This information may be used as best available data and
be used as the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is adopted that
incorporates the data. (Ord. 4-2009, 6-8-2009)

12-1-6-3: VARIANCE PROCEDURE:
   A.   Appeal Board:
      1.   The city council as established by ordinance shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
city of Cambridge in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      3.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the city council, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the court, as provided in ordinance.
      4.   In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      5.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from flood elevations should be quite rare.
      6.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection B1 of
this section, and otherwise complies with subsections 12-1-7-1A, C and D of the
general standards of this chapter.
      7.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below
the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk. (Ord. 3-2009, 5-11-2009)
12-1-7: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
12-1-7-1: GENERAL STANDARDS 1 :
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required.
   A.   Anchoring:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      2.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
   B.   Construction Materials And Methods:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. (Ord. 15-
86, 2-9-1987)
      3.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be elevated or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. (Ord. 3-2009, 5-11-2009)
   C.   Utilities:
      1.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
      2.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
      3.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   D.   Subdivision Proposals:
      1.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      2.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage;
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
      4.   Where base flood elevation data have not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
   E.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source
(subsection 12-1-6-2B of this chapter), applications for building permits shall
be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of
historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where
available. Failure to elevate at least two feet (2') above grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)

12-1-7-2: SPECIFIC STANDARDS 1 :
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
12-1-5 or subsection 12-1-6-2B of this chapter, additional standards were
clarified in FEMA technical bulletin 11-01 to allow crawl space construction
for buildings located in the special flood hazard areas; however, adopting this
provision can result in a twenty percent (20%) increase in flood insurance
premiums. The following provisions are required: (Ord. 3-2009, 5-11-2009)
   A.   Residential Construction:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot
(1') or more above flood protection elevation. (Ord. 4-2009, 6-8-2009)
      2.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
Foundation vent standards required by the IBC/IRC outside the floodplain do not
meet this standard and are often inadvertently permitted. Insurance rates
reflect an "all or nothing" standard, meaning, partially ventilated crawl
spaces may be subject to an additional loading fee of twenty (20) to twenty
five percent (25%) attached to the annual insurance premium. A subgrade crawl
space will be subject to an additional loading fee of twenty percent (20%)
attached to the annual insurance premium.
         d.   Below grade crawl spaces are prohibited at sites where the
velocity of floodwaters exceeds five feet (5') per second.
         e.   All building utility systems within the crawl space shall be
elevated above base flood elevation or be designed so that floodwaters cannot
enter or accumulate within the system component during flood.
         f.   The interior of a crawl space below the base flood elevation must
not be more than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG)
and the height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade
of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation must not exceed
four feet (4') at any point.
         g.   Below grade crawl spaces constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
However, applicants who construct buildings that have below grade crawl spaces
are hereby advised that such buildings will have higher flood insurance
premiums than buildings that have crawl spaces with interior elevations at or
above the lowest adjacent grade. (Ord. 3-2009, 5-11-2009)
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: Construction and substantial improvement
of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the flood
protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall: (Ord. 4-2009, 6-8-2009)
      1.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
      3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection 12-1-6-2B3b of this chapter;
      4.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must
meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection A2 of this section;
      5.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood
level will be rated as one foot below that level). (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
   C.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the flood protection elevation and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 12-1-7-1A of this chapter.
   D.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles placed on sites are
required to either:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days, or
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking
system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
      3.   Meet the requirements of subsection C of this section and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 4-2009, 6-8-
2009)

12-1-7-3: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
12-1-5 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section
12-1-7.
Note: Where base flood elevations have been provided but floodways have not,
this section
12-1-7-3 should read as follows:
12-1-7-3: ENCROACHMENTS: The cumulative effect of any proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1')
at any point.
(Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
12-1-8: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987)
12-1-9: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTION:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 15-86,
2-9-1987)
12-1-10: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
   A.   Violation A Misdemeanor: No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of
the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-
1987)
   B.   Penalty Imposed: Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject
to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 15-86, 2-9-1987; amd. 1998 Code)
