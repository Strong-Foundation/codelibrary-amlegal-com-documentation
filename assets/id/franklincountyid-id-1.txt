North, turns east and runs east along Fourth North to the Worm Creek. It
follows the Worm Creek, as it turns north and runs in a northeasterly direction
along the Worm Creek to 2200 East. At 2200 East it turns north and runs north
along 2200 East to Highway 34. It crosses Highway 34 and runs west along the

him or her to do so. If it shall be decided by the court that such petition is
legally sufficient, the County Clerk shall then file it, with a certified copy
of the judgment attached thereto, as of the date on which it was originally
offered for filing in his or her office. On a showing that any petition filed
is not legally sufficient, the court may enjoin the County Clerk and all other
officers from certifying or printing on the official ballot for the ensuing
election the ballot title and numbers of such measure. All such suits shall be
advanced on the court docket and heard and decided by the court as quickly as
possible. Either party may appeal to the supreme court within ten working days
after a decision is rendered.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make any false affidavit
concerning any petition to this section or to leave a petition unattended for

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This is the Franklin County Comprehensive Plan. It is adopted for the
purpose of promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of
the county and, specifically, to assure that future land development meets
reasonable quality expectations and growth rate to not deplete natural
resources.
   (B)   Those expectations are expressed in the policy statements of this plan
and the standards of the accompanying Franklin County Development Code.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.02 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   This comprehensive plan is adopted under the authority of the state’s
Local Planning Act, which requires counties to prepare comprehensive plans and
regulate land development and land use in the public interest (see Idaho Code
§§ 67-6501 et seq.).
   (B)   The Local Planning Act further requires that all comprehensive plans
include certain components or a specific statement explaining why a particular
component is not needed (see Idaho Code § 67-6508).
   (C)   Table 1 shows how the components of the County Comprehensive Plan
fulfill the requirements of the Local Planning Act.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.03 PAST PLANS.
   The first county comprehensive plan (Optimum Land Use Plan) was adopted in
1976. That plan and subsequent updates are superseded by this Comprehensive
Plan.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.04 PREVIEW.
   The County Comprehensive Plan has two parts. Part I describes historical and
relevant background information regarding the county. Part II presents the
policy statements adopted to provide general guidance for land development
activities in the county and a defensible basis for the more specific
requirements of the County Development Code.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
§ 32.15 PLANNING AREA LOCATION.
   The county area, about 90 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah, and 60 miles
southeast of Pocatello, Idaho, is located in the northern portion of Cache
Valley, one of the most attractive and highly settled valleys of southeastern
Idaho. Cache Valley extends some 50 miles from north the south and averages
about ten miles in width. The Idaho/Utah state line divides the valley
approximately in half.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.16 COUNTY HISTORY.
   (A)   The human history of the county is important to land use because of
the cultural values of its first Mormon settlers, the division of the land and
resources, and the continued closeness of the community to this heritage.
   (B)   On April 14, 1860, 13 pioneer families arrived to settle the northern
end of the Cache Valley, at which time the community of Franklin was
established and is now designated as the first permanent settlement in the
State of Idaho. One of the first projects was the building of an irrigation
system to distribute water from Spring Creek. As more settlers arrived, the
land and water was divided and communities were established as follows: Oxford
1864, Clifton 1865, Weston 1865, Preston 1866, Dayton 1867, Whitney 1869,
Fairview 1869, Mink Creek 1872, Mapleton 1874, Nashville 1875, Treasureton
1875, Riverdale 1875, Dunnville 1876 (abandoned in 1878 and resettled later as
Banida), Battle Creek 1877, Glendale 1884, Winder 1890, and Banida 1906.
   (C)   On February 15, 1872 an official survey conducted by the Department of
the Interior placed these settlers, not in Utah territory as they believed, but
residents of the territory of Idaho. The official county was named Oneida and
extended from the Utah line north to Montana, east to Wyoming and west beyond
American Falls, with the county seat first located in Soda Springs and later
moved to Malad.
   (D)   It was not until January 1913 that Franklin County was officially
established with an eventual total land area of 425,880 acres or 670.1 square
miles. The City of Preston was officially established as the county seat.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.17 PHILOSOPHY OF THE PLAN.
   (A)   The plan is a general statement of goals and policies relating to
development of the community. The plan is long range and encompasses all
aspects of development and its impact on the citizens of the community and its
environment. Development policies are the basis of the plan and they will
address natural resources, water conservation, housing and development,
wildlife, recreation, industry, and land use. All policies, regulations, and
standards as designated by the community will be in compliance with state and
federal law.
   (B)   Future land uses are not precisely located with respect to individual
properties or areas as would be the case in a zoning map. This is necessary to
allow latitude in making specific day-to-day decisions which are necessary for
plan implementation. It is impossible to determine the location of all land
uses in advance of need and development. Development policies facilitate the
implementation of the plan.
   (C)   Growth rate cannot be accurately predicted but will be governed by
employment opportunities, availability of resources such as water, capacity of
current infrastructure, and density as dictated by statute and Health and
Sanitary Code.
   (D)   The plan must be continually re-evaluated against the concepts and
goals of the community, and thus implement the achievement of those goals.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.18 COUNTY GEOGRAPHY.
   (A)   When we consider the geological history, we begin to understand the
significant variations of the geological formations in our county and their
impact on future development.
   (B)   Cache Valley is a high mountain valley surrounded by the Bear River
Range of the Wasatch Mountains on the east, with peaks rising to 10,000 feet,
and the Wellsville and Malad Ranges on the west.
   (C)   The Utah/Idaho border cuts the valley approximately in half with
Franklin County, Idaho located in the north end. Preston, the county seat, has
an elevation of 4,710 feet, and average annual rainfall of 16.5 inches and a
growing season of 123 frost-free days.
   (D)   The mountain ranges bordering the west, east, and north sides of our
county have peaks reaching close to 10,000 feet in elevation. The valley floor
ranges between 4,500 feet to 5,100 feet. Franklin County and most of Cache
Valley came into its present form through structural faults and adjustments by
the shifting and settling of the valley. The valley floor soon was below the
drainage outlet of the valley, therefore, it filled with water even prior to
the Lake Bonneville Era.
   (E)   The Lake Bonneville Era occurred during the Pleistocene or Glacial
Epoch when the climate was cooler with increased rainfall and decreased
evaporation. The stream flows were greatly enhanced and this condition
continued for thousands of years. The lake covered the entire Cache Valley,
extending north to Red Rock Pass and Swan Lake and up through the Bear River
Canyon nearly to Grace, Idaho. The surface of the lake reached an elevation of
5,150 feet, had a maximum depth of 1,080 feet and at its highest level it
covered 19,750 square miles with approximately 2,500 miles of shoreline.
   (F)   Due to the action of this large lake, peat beds were buried and sand
deltas were formed. As the lake receded the natural streams flowing from the
canyons deposited their loads of sand, gravel, and soil to form the deltas at
the mouth of each stream, the Dayton bench, and the bench on the east side of
the Bear River.
   (G)   The formation of deltas, as described, has created geological
conditions which must be addressed when considering locations for the
construction of homes, industrial sites, domestic and irrigation water systems,
septic or waste disposal systems, and roads and bridges. Hazardous building
conditions, high mineral content water sources, and soil percolation factors
must all be considered in the County Comprehensive Plan and its Development
Code.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.19 LANDSCAPE AND OWNERSHIP.
   (A)   The county consists of two major valleys. The largest valley portion
is Cache Valley and it extends from the Idaho/Utah state border north to the
Red Rock Pass. This area of the county supports the largest agricultural entity
and includes both irrigated and dry farm crop production. It also has many
dairy and beef cattle operations. A smaller valley lies on the east side of the
county, sometimes known as Gentile Valley, where the City of Grace is located.
This is a scenic valley that also supports dairy and beef cattle operations and
agricultural production. The agricultural producing land in both of these major
valleys produces mainly feed crops utilized by the livestock operations. The
major crops are alfalfa, wheat, and barley. The county produced many cash or
row crops which were processed locally: sugar beets, peas, beans, sweet corn,
and cabbage. These crops are virtually non-existent in the county at this time.
This is due to the closure of local sugar processing plants and the canning
plants operated by Del Monte. The areas between the major valleys of the county
consist of rolling hills and smaller valleys that also produce feed and some
cash crops. The outer boundary on the east and west sides of the valley
consists of foothills and mountains with forest and rangeland, much of which is
owned by the U.S. Forest Service and B.L.M. The privately owned land on the
mountainous county borders is used extensively for recreational purposes
consisting of hunting, fishing, camping, and summer or seasonal use residences.
A large portion of the residences in the described borders are year-round
residences and there are some agricultural and livestock operations in these
areas.
   (B)   The state’s Department of Commerce county profile report gives the
following statistics pertaining to land ownership within the county:
      (1)   Federal: 32.6% or 138,994 acres;
      (2)   State: 3.1% or 13,250 acres;
      (3)   Private: 64.2% or 273,636 acres; and
      (4)   Total: 425,880 acres.

§ 32.20 POPULATION.
   (A)   The following statistics were gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau
report dated May 2020.
   (B)   The population of the county grew from 12,494 in 2007 to 14,194 in
2020. That is an average growth of 11%. The number of building permits issued
on a yearly basis rose from 12 in 1995 to an average of 100 in recent years in
the unincorporated areas of the county. This indicates that building and
development within the county are continuing to increase due to the population
increase. There is a noticeable increase in the number of retirement age
individuals and also an increase in the number of individuals who commute
between Northern Utah and Franklin County due to employment in Utah while
residing in the county. The fact that these trends continue necessitates county
planning based on continued growth.
   (C)   The building permit numbers are for the unincorporated county areas
only. The incorporated areas issue their own building permits.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.21 ECONOMY.
   (A)   (1)   There is a reasonably stable agriculture base supported mainly
by the dairy, beef, and poultry industries. There are a limited number of small
to medium sized animal confinement operations which also contribute to the
local economy. Ritewood Eggs, Nyoplast America, Lundal Mfg., Trails West, and
Franklin County Medical Center have continued to expand and are providing a
substantial labor base and contribution to the community.
      (2)   The county supports two school districts, Preston School District
201 and Westside School district 202, both providing a sizeable labor base for
the county. Part of the Grace School District 148 lies in the northeastern part
of the county.
   (B)   (1)   Pioneer Newspapers located in the county in the year 2000 and
prints the newspapers for the Herald Journal of Logan, Utah and the Idaho State
Journal of Pocatello, Idaho, increasing the labor force by an estimated 40
employees.
      (2)   The unemployment rate in the county at this time is 3.7%,
indicating a reasonably stable labor base within the area.

POLICY STATEMENTS
§ 32.35 GENERALLY.
   The policy statements of this comprehensive plan offer general guidance for
land use decision making in the county. They also provide direction and goals
for the County Development Code, most sections of which may be traced directly
back to one or more of the policy statements of this plan. Policies are adopted
for the county as a whole, as one planning area.
Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.36 PROPERTY RIGHTS.
   (A)   The county recognizes the importance of property rights established by
the federal and state constitutions. One purpose of this plan, as authorized by
Idaho Code § 67-6502(a), is to protect property rights and enhance property
values. The county recognizes that major changes in the use of property
inevitably affect the entire community. The freedom to make such changes is
meaningful only when land owners accept responsibility for the consequences of
their actions, and avoid or mitigate adverse impacts. This plan and the
accompanying Development Code provide guidance for land owners seeking to
fulfill that responsibility.
   (B)   The 1995 legislature amended state’s Local Planning Act to require
that a property rights element be added to local comprehensive plans. The
legislature also expanded the state’s regulatory takings statute to cover local
governments. These two implementation strategies respond to the direction
provided by the legislature.
      (1)   The County Planning and Zoning Commission and the County
Commissioners will consider the potential impact of this plan or the County
Development Code on property rights. In doing so, they will use the guidelines
prepared by the state’s Attorney General.
      (2)   The County Development Code will include a procedure for the review
of claims that a county decision has affected a taking of property without
compensation, as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.37 CITIZEN PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   The county will actively encourage citizen participation in the
planning process. The county’s commitment to citizen participation is affirmed
by the extensive program of participation used to develop this comprehensive
plan.
   (B)   The strategies for continuing implementation of this policy are:
      (1)   Provide notice of public hearings on proposals for the amendment of
this plan or the Development Code;
      (2)   Adopt a formal public hearing procedure as required by the Local
Planning Act. See Idaho Code § 67-6534 for the requirement; and
      (3)   Use of the advisory committee structure whenever significant plan
or Development Code amendments are proposed, or seem to be indicated by
changing conditions.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.38 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   It shall be the county’s policy to maintain this comprehensive plan
with regular updates of the background studies and amendments reflecting
changing conditions.
   (B)   Strategies are:
      (1)   Budget for the update of social and economic profiles and public
facilities inventory; and
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission will dedicate one meeting each
year to a review of the plan and code.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.39 NATURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of the county to maintain, protect, and enhance
the natural assets of the planning area. The county will direct development
away from naturally hazardous sites or, where feasible, require site planning
or construction techniques that mitigate the hazard.
   (B)   The following regulatory strategies may be used to implement this
policy.
      (1)   Culinary or domestic water resources may be conserved by a county
wide or development wide water distribution management system. Underground
aquifers must be protected from depletion and contamination.
      (2)   The county will use its Development Code to protect surface water
resources. Stream corridor protection will be addressed in the Development
Code. The county will adopt Development Code standards that require or
encourage water quality protection, runoff, and erosion control, wetlands
protection, and development setbacks along stream beds and lake or reservoir
shores.
      (3)   The county will use its Development Code to direct development away
from flood hazard areas and steep slopes. The code will also require or
encourage development and construction techniques that mitigate such natural
hazards as accelerated soil erosion, flooding, slope failure, and wildfire.
      (4)   Rural developments in the county are vulnerable to destruction by
wildfire. In these areas, the county will use its Development Code to encourage
fire controlling lot planning and encourage the provision of a water supply
adequate for firefighting. Protection of existing forest and other vegetation
will be accomplished through the designation of open space or preservation
areas where development is conducted.
      (5)   Development should be encouraged that is sensitive to the needs of
wildlife. Note that habitat protection is also one objective of the wetlands
and stream corridor protection strategies. Wildlife habitat maps have been
prepared to aid in implementation of this strategy.
      (6)   The county will use its Development Code to encourage development
that protects scenic views.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.40 LAND USE.
   Issues to be addressed within the county will include agricultural,
industrial, commercial, and recreational uses, and development limitations.
   (A)   Agriculture.
      (1)   The county will encourage preservation of prime agricultural land;
however, preservation of agricultural land should not override the option of
the land owner to determine the use of his or her property.
      (2)   It shall be the policy of the county to recognize the economic
importance of agriculture in the county by discouraging development that may
conflict with existing farm operations, requiring future rural residents to
acknowledge the right of neighboring agricultural operations to continue, and
discourage the conversion of productive crop lands to other uses.
      (3)   This policy recognizes both the importance of agriculture and the
possibility of conflict between agricultural and other land uses. These
implementation strategies are designed to minimize that conflict.
         (a)   Franklin County will enforce Idaho Code § 31-3805, a state
statute that requires participation of potentially affected irrigators in
reviewing proposed subdivisions, and requires developers to either transfer the
water rights away from a parcel before it is subdivided or provide a central
irrigation system. The county will also use its Development Code to require the
explicit permission of an irrigation entity for any additional discharge of
surface runoff into its system.
         (b)   Developers or individual land owners will be required to present
development plans, subdivision applications, and building permit applications
to irrigation entities for review and comment when service, distribution, or
storage facilities are adjacent to or within the property boundaries of the
proposed development or building side. When safety, water quality, maintenance
easements, and other issues are a concern, it will be the responsibility of the
developing entity to prove suitability of the proposed development or building
site or sites.
         (c)   The county will attempt to minimize friction between rural
residential development and existing agriculture operations. Wherever rural
residential development is permitted, the county may require an easement or
buffer in favor of the continuation of normal farm operations.
         (d)   The county will also discourage industrial or commercial
development within areas that conflict with or adversely affect established
agricultural operations.
         (e)   Large agricultural enterprises (dairies, feedlots, animal solid
waste composting, handling of agricultural chemicals, and the like) can have an
adverse impact on nearby developments or dwellings. All animal confinement
operations regardless of size require application, review, and compliance with
the county ordinances prior to issuance of a building or operating permit.
         (f)   The same scrutiny will be applied to proposed residential
developments that may be incompatible with existing agricultural industries.
         (g)   The Development Code will require mitigation of potential
nuisances as the result of improper handling of solid waste, and the odor,
insects, and the like generated by the improper keeping of livestock on
residential lots.
   (B)   Commercial. The county will encourage commercial development within
areas that do not conflict with, or adversely affect, established agricultural,
industrial, or residential developments.
      (1)   The County Development Code will require mitigation of potential
nuisances including noise, glare, building height and bulk, activity levels,
and other relevant measures. Retention or installation of landscaped buffers
between potentially incompatible uses may be required.
      (2)   Home occupations will be permitted in the county, subject to
conditions that assure their compatibility with neighboring uses.
      (3)   There are extensive mineral resources in the county, the
development of which may conflict with nearby land use. The County Development
Code will include performance standards designed to assure that new or expanded
mineral extraction does not adversely affect neighboring uses nor water
quality.
      (4)   The county will use its Development Code to encourage cooperative
site planning, including shared access drives and parking, and shared buffers
and open space.
   (C)   Industrial. The county will encourage industrial development within
areas that do not conflict with, or adversely affect, the established
agricultural, commercial, or residential developments.
      (1)   The County Development Code will require mitigation of potential
nuisances including noise, glare, building height and bulk, activity levels,
and other relevant measures. Retention or installation of landscaped buffers
between potentially incompatible uses may be required.
      (2)   “State Land Use Code” will be used to determine industrial
classification.
   (D)   Recreational. It shall be the policy of the county to maintain the
natural assets of the recreational areas within the county. These areas will be
subjected to the same requirements as set forth in policy number 4, “Natural
Resources”. Additional requirements and implementation strategies are:
      (1)   Development density must not affect water quality where individual
wells are used in lieu of a central water system. Southeast District Health
Department standards will provide density guidelines pertaining to acceptable
sewage systems;
      (2)   Recreational developments must prepare a fire protection plan that
will delineate fire-wise construction, design and materials, defensible space,
fuel load assessments, and the like;
      (3)   Visual sensitivity will be addressed by the standards for
recreational development. Density levels will be set to protect the pristine
environment desired by those who reside on a full- or part-time basis in
forest, meadow, waterfront, riverside, streamside, or view enhanced areas;
      (4)   Commercial development, home occupations, isolated lodges, and
stores may be permitted in recreational areas subject to conditions assuring
compatibility with neighboring uses;
      (5)   Industrial development may be prohibited in recreational areas;
      (6)   Compatibility of proposed developments will be evaluated on the
basis of building height, environmental factors, proposed uses, activity
levels, and similar measures. Retention or installation of landscaped buffers
between potentially incompatible uses may also be required; and
      (7)   The county will encourage cooperative site planning, including
shared access drives and parking, and shared buffers and open space.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.41 DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of the county to limit development to the
density appropriate for the site and the area’s rural character, and to
encourage a development pattern that discourages conversion of productive crop
land to other uses, respects environmental limitations, and provides open
space. The county will encourage a pattern of development that concentrates on
suitable sites that avoid areas with limited or restricted access to public
facilities and services and environmentally sensitive areas. A lower density of
development may be required in areas where there is a potential hazard of
ground water contamination, or potential aquifer depletion or contamination as
determined by countywide water availability research. All development must pay
for itself. County tax dollars shall not be used for the development of
residential, commercial, or industrial developments.
   (B)   The county is unable to subsidize or provide infrastructure for new,
expanded, or changed use developments. To protect the general taxpayer and
future occupants of developments in the county, developers will be required to
provide safe adequate roads and other essential facilities. The county will
implement this policy using the following strategies.
      (1)   Provision of state-approved central water systems, including water
systems that produce adequate fire flows, are encouraged. Where reliance on
individual wells is proposed, the county may require evidence that a sufficient
potable water supply is available.
      (2)   On-site sewage disposal systems are required to comply with all
applicable state standards.
      (3)   Power, telephone, and other private utilities must be provided in
all developments, with the exception of recreational properties.
      (4)   All uses must provide the off-street parking and loading areas
needed to help prevent local traffic congestion.
      (5)   Access to public lands and waters is an important part of the
recreational experience available to the residents of the county. New
developments must not block historically existing access roads or trails. The
code will also encourage the provision of new or improved public access by
developers.
      (6)   In addition to encouraging the provision of water supplies adequate
for firefighting purposes, building heights must be restricted to that which
can be effectively protected by the Franklin County Fire Protection District.
      (7)   State law (Idaho Code §§ 67-6508(c), 67-6511(a), and 67-6513)
specifically requires that the county consider the potential impacts of
proposed developments on local schools. This requirement will be implemented by
referring all applications for permits to the County School Districts for
review and comment.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.42 COUNTY ROAD SYSTEMS.
   (A)   The county will protect the efficient functioning of existing roads by
limiting access where necessary, protecting rights-of-way from unnecessary
encroachments, and ensuring that utility work and other necessary encroachments
do not create safety hazards or result in added maintenance costs.
   (B)   A description of the county’s road network will be provided by the
County Road Department. These strategies apply to both county roads and public
roads that are not maintained by the county.
      (1)   Safe, adequate access to new developments will be required in the
county.
      (2)   The county will clarify the status of existing county and public
roads, and adopt permit requirements and standards for encroachment.
      (3)   The County Road Department will provide an annually updated road
inventory map with classes of all roads within the county clearly coded.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.43 AIRPORTS.
   (A)   It shall be the county’s policy to protect the public investment in
local airports and the safety of air travelers by adopting airport area height
limitations and safety restrictions, as recommended by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   (B)   There is one airport in the county: the Preston Municipal Airport. The
county’s strategy for implementation of this policy will be to prevent any
conflict with the operation of Preston’s Municipal Airport and assure the
integrity of the airport by adopting, and enforcing the relevant portions of
the Federal Aviation Administration regulations for “Objects Affecting
Navigable Airspace”.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.44 WASTE DISPOSAL.
   Solid waste disposal, salvage waste handling, and recyclable waste handling
require constant surveillance and compliance with applicable federal, state,
and local authority.
   (A)   The county will maintain a central landfill that is in compliance with
EPA, DEQ, Southeastern District Health Department, and Idaho Code requirements
at all times.
   (B)   The county may provide and maintain an EPA, DEQ, and state approved
recycling facility at the designated county landfill. Recycling of materials
that are economically sustainable is encouraged.
   (C)   The county’s unlicenced or abandoned vehicle ordinance will be
enforced to establish and control salvaged and/or storage of wrecked,
abandoned, or unlicenced vehicles and equipment.
   (D)   Hazardous waste materials may be stored or disposed of in county
facilities which are in compliance with applicable state and federal
regulations.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.45 MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   It shall be the policy of the county to use its manufactured home ordinance
and/or Development Code to set forth the use, size, and location requirements
for manufactured homes within the county.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.46 HERD DISTRICTS.
   The county has designated herd districts. These districts are created by
authority of Idaho Code § 25-2401 and compliance with those requirements will
be enforced by local authority. A map designating the established herd
districts will be provided, stored, and kept available by the County Clerk. All
uses not designated as herd districts will be open range areas. Movement of
livestock on county roads or established routes will be permitted. It is
recommended that the County Sheriff’s office be notified prior to movement of
livestock on these routes to ensure safety and/or assistance.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.47 NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.
   (A)   It shall be the county’s policy to continue participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program. Participation in this Program allows local
residents potentially affected by flooding to purchase insurance. Development
planning policies will require the protection of stream corridors with
construction standards for any development that is permitted within the
floodplain.
   (B)   Detailed maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) may be reviewed at the County Clerk’s office. Development in these areas
not only exposes its occupants to a natural hazard, but may increase flood
damages downstream.
(Ord. 2007-8-13B, passed 8-13-2007; Ord. 2022-2-28, passed 2-28-2022)
§ 32.48 EXCHANGE OR SALE OF FEDERAL AND STATE LANDS.
   (A)   It shall be the county’s policy to encourage land exchanges that place
stream and lakeshore corridors, wetlands, wildlife habitat, and other sensitive
areas in public ownership, while placing state and federal lands that are
suitable for development in private ownership. The county also recognizes the
possibility that state lands may be leased or sold for development. Development
resulting from state or federal land exchanges, leases, or sales must comply
with this plan and the County Development Code. This policy does not apply to
land exchanges between public agencies, for instance, an exchange between the
Bureau of Land Management and the state’s Department of Lands.
   (B)   More than 35% of the county’s land area is in public ownership, but
the public/private boundary can change. The exchange, lease, or sale of public
lands for development can benefit the people of the county, but only where the
transition to private control is made in compliance with the following
strategies, which must be cooperatively implemented by the county, state, and
federal agencies.
      (1)   Federal/private land exchanges should result in the protection of
sensitive areas in the county.
      (2)   Federal/private land exchanges and public land leases and sales
should be based on specific proposals for the development of suitable sites,
and not finalized until the proposed development has been approved by the
county. Implementation of this strategy will require the federal agency to have
the beneficiary of the exchange retain a design firm, prepare a site plan, and
follow the county’s application procedures, just as that person would do if
developing private land.
      (3)   The county believes there is an opportunity for an innovative
combination of the federal environmental assessment, state and county planning
and zoning review processes on proposed land exchanges. All agencies should use
the county plan as a scoping document and the hearing held by the Planning and
Zoning Commission as its forum for public input. Representatives of the state’s
Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service are encouraged to discuss this
possibility with the Commission the next time an exchange is proposed.

planned operation and protect adjacent water sources or local aquifer from
contamination or depletion.
   (B)   Installation of landscape buffers between potentially incompatible
land uses and along public roads shall be encouraged. Buffering along stream
corridors is required.
   (C)   (1)   Setbacks to establish a buffer between neighboring land owners
shall be established as follows.
 
Animal Units Setbacks                             Distance from AGO Facility to

Over 2,000   750 ft.+ 100 ft. for each 1,000      1 mile
             animal units over 2,000
 
      (2)   Where ACOs are immediately adjacent to each other the setback
requirements may overlap upon the recordable written agreement of both
operations. In addition, the land of a third party may be included in the
setback property so long as such third party consents in a recordable document.
      (3)   Buffers between ACOs and neighboring property may include berms,
foliage, windbreaks, walls, natural terrain, and other buffers. An applicant
may include one or more of the foregoing buffers in support of a request for a
variance from the setback requirement.
   (D)   Prevailing wind directions will be considered.
   (E)   Waste management control will be considered (i.e., odor control, waste
storage, and waste disposal).
   (F)   No ACO shall channel storm water or snow melt runoff in a way that
adversely impacts neighboring properties or public ways or channeled into
irrigation systems without written consent of the responsible irrigation
entity.
   (G)   As required by Idaho Code § 22-2407, it shall be the duty and
responsibility of all persons to control noxious weeds on land and property

RABIES PREVENTION
§ 90.25 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The state’s Departments of Agriculture and Health and Welfare, and
District Health Departments, and the United States Department of Agriculture
have important roles to play in the prevention, control, and treatment of
rabies in the state. The following protocol represents a consensus of agreement
by these agencies on appropriate control of rabies within the state.
   (B)   Rabies is a rare disease in humans. Only a handful of cases are
reported each year in the United States. Over two-thirds of all human cases
that have occurred have been associated with bats. Frequently these cases
occurred in young children or infants who could not report a contact or bite.
In this state, the only species known to be a reservoir for rabies is bats.
Some information from Montana suggests that rabies may be prevalent in skunk
populations near the border of our two states; although no trapping in this
state has been done to verify this. Rodents are not a reservoir for rabies in
this state and little to no risk exists of contracting rabies from a rodent
bite.
   (C)   All situations involving rabies and animal bites are unique. No
protocol can address every situation that may occur. The intent of this
protocol is to provide a structure for decision making based on the latest
scientific evidence and recommendations from national organizations. Questions
regarding rabies or this protocol may be directed to the state’s Department of
Agriculture, Division of Animal Industries, at (208) 332-8540 or the state’s
Department of Health and Welfare, Epidemiology Services Program, at (208) 334-

§ 90.26 DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPROPRIATELY VACCINATED ANIMAL. A domestic animal or livestock will be
considered appropriately vaccinated for the purposes of rabies control when the
owner has documented that the animal:
      (1)   Is older than three months;
      (2)   Has been vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian with a rabies
vaccine approved by the USDA for use in that species;
      (3)   Has received the appropriate number of vaccinations for its age as
specified in the CARC; and
      (4)   Has received its last vaccination more than 30 days prior.
   COMPENDIUM OF ANIMAL RABIES CONTROL (CARC). The compendium is updated
annually by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is the definitive national
authority on animal rabies control issues.
   CONTACT or BITE. Refers to a bite, scratch, or exposure to body fluids from
a rabies susceptible animal. The actual witnessing of a BITE or ATTACK by a
potentially rabid animal is not required for an exposure to have occurred. This
latter situation is of most concern with bats.
   DOMESTIC ANIMAL. A dog, cat, or ferret.
   LIVESTOCK. Cattle, swine, horses, mules, asses, and native and non-native
domestic ungulates.
   PROVOKED ATTACK. An attack is considered “provoked” if an animal is placed
in a situation such that an expected reaction would be to bite or attack. This
would include, but not be limited to, invasion of an animal’s territory,
attempting to pet or handle an unfamiliar animal, startling an animal,
assisting an injured or sick animal, trying to capture an animal or removing
food, water, or other objects in the animal’s possession.
   QUARANTINE. Refers to animals intended to prevent exposure of an animal to
members of the public or other animals. QUARANTINE must take place in a cage or
other suitable facility and requires the involvement of a licensed veterinarian
and inspection of the facility. Two levels of QUARANTINE are defined,
impoundment and strict isolation. Careful attention should be paid to these
terms and their use in this document.
      (1)   IMPOUNDMENT. Refers to the isolation of animal within a facility
such as a veterinary clinic, animal control facility, commercial boarding
establishment, or other establishment under the direct supervision of a
veterinarian. IMPOUNDMENT does not take place at an owner’s home or premises.
      (2)   STRICT ISOLATION. Refers to the isolation of animal within a
facility such as a veterinary clinic, animal control facility, commercial
boarding establishment, the owner’s home, or other premises that ensures no
contact with the public or other animals can occur. STRICT ISOLATION may occur
at the owner’s home or premises.
   RABIES EXPOSURE. “Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced
into bite wounds, open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes. Because rabies
virus is found in concentrations sufficient for infection only in the saliva,
salivary glands, and central nervous system tissue of rabid animals,
contamination from other organs and body fluids is usually not considered a
risk for rabies transmission.” As written in the new recommendations on human
rabies prevention from the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) of
the Public Health Service (MMWR: Jan. 8, 1999/Vol 48/No. RR.-1), Special
consideration taken with bat exposures. (New definition recommended by the
“compendium”.)
   RABIES SUSCEPTIBLE ANIMAL. All warm blooded animals. Reptiles, birds,
amphibians, insects, and arachnids are not considered rabies susceptible
species.
   UNDER OWNER’S CONTROL. Refers to the isolation of an animal, at the owner’s
premises, that ensures no exposure to the public or other animals will occur.
   UNPROVOKED ATTACK. An unprovoked attack or bite occurs when an animal
strikes for no apparent reason. The behavior should be unusual for the
particular animal or species. A confirmation of chronic aggressive behavior
would reduce the likelihood that a bite is UNPROVOKED.
   USDA. United States Department of Agriculture.
   WILD ANIMAL. All other animals. For wolf hybrid concerns refer to the most
recent CARC.
(Ord. passed 12-10-2001)
§ 90.27 FIRST AID TREATMENT.
   (A)   All situations involving humans being bitten by animals should be
referred to a health care provider. It is the responsibility of the health care
provider and patient to make decisions regarding the necessity of rabies
prophylaxis or immunization. However, government officials frequently can aid
the health care provider in making educated decisions based on the nature of
the bite and epidemiology of rabies in the state.
   (B)   (1)   Immediate and thorough treatment of bite wounds and scratches is
an important first step to preventing rabies in humans. Scrubbing with soap and
water, detergent and water, or generously flushing with water alone should be
done immediately. Tetanus prophylaxis and measures to prevent bacterial
infection should always be considered as well.
      (2)   (a)   It is recommended that sutures not be used unless it is
unavoidable for cosmetic or tissue support reasons.
         (b)   Sutures should be placed after local infiltration with rabies
antiserum, should be loose, and should not interfere with bleeding or drainage.
(Ord. passed 12-10-2001)
§ 90.28 PROTOCOL FOR RABIES PROPHYLAXIS AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   A dog, cat, or ferret bites a human.
      (1)   If the biting animal was appropriately vaccinated and is available:
         (a)   The dog, cat, or ferret may be euthanized and the head submitted
for rabies test; or
         (b)   The dog, cat, or ferret should be first examined by a licensed
veterinarian. If not found to be exhibiting signs of rabies, it should be
placed under owner’s control for ten days and re-examined by a licensed
veterinarian prior to being released or at the first sign of symptoms.
            1.   If the animal dies or shows symptoms of rabies during the ten-
day observation period, it must be euthanized and the head submitted for rabies
testing. Communicate these facts and results of testing to the appropriate
persons immediately. Advise the victim to begin rabies prophylaxis immediately,
if not already done so.
            2.   If the animal does not show symptoms of rabies, release the
animal.
      (2)   If the biting animal was not appropriately vaccinated and is
available for quarantine:
         (a)   Unvaccinated ferrets must be euthanized and the head submitted
for rabies testing;
         (b)   The dog or cat may be euthanized and the head submitted for
rabies testing; or
         (c)   If the bite was provoked, the animal must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian, and if not found to be exhibiting signs of rabies, kept
under strict isolation for ten days.
            1.   If the animal dies or shows symptoms of rabies during the
observation period, it must be euthanized and the head submitted for rabies
testing. Communicate these facts and results of testing to the appropriate
persons immediately. Advise the victim to begin rabies prophylaxis immediately,
if not already doing so.
            2.   If the animal does not show symptoms of rabies, release the
animal. The animal must be re-examined and vaccinated by a licensed
veterinarian prior to release.
         (d)   If the bite was provoked, the animal must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian, and if not found to be exhibiting signs of rabies,
impounded for ten days.
            1.   If the animal dies or shows symptoms of rabies during the
observation period, it must be euthanized and the head submitted for rabies
testing. Communicate these facts and results of testing to the appropriate
persons immediately. Advise the victim to begin rabies prophylaxis immediately,
if not already doing so.
            2.   If the animal does not show symptoms of rabies, release the
animal. The animal must be re-examined and vaccinated by a licensed
veterinarian prior to release.
         (e)   The biting animal is not available for quarantine. Refer the
victim to a physician for possible rabies prophylaxis.
   (B)   A wild animal bites a human.
      (1)   If the wild animal is available:
         (a)   The animal must be euthanized and the head submitted to the
laboratory for testing; and
         (b)   Refer the victim to a physician for possible rabies prophylaxis.
If the rabies test of the wild animal is positive, recommended rabies
prophylaxis be started immediately.
      (2)   If the wild animal is not available. Refer the victim to a
physician immediately for possible rabies prophylaxis.
   (C)   Bats.
      (1)   If a bat is available for testing and the person(s) cannot exclude
the possibility of exposure: if a bat is physically present and there is doubt
as to whether a contact or bite occurred, the bat should be submitted for
rabies analysis. Exposed person(s) should be referred to a physician
immediately and rabies prophylaxis considered. If the results of rabies testing
will not be delayed, it is acceptable to delay prophylaxis until the results of
testing are known.
      (2)   If the bat is not available for testing, refer the victim to a
physician immediately for possible rabies prophylaxis.
   (D)   A livestock animal bites a human. Refer to the state’s Department of
Agriculture, Division of Animal Industries, at (208) 332-8540, for management
of the animal.
   (E)   A wild animal bites a dog, cat, or ferret.
      (1)   If the wild animal is available for testing:
         (a)   Submit the head of the wild animal to the Department of Health
and Welfare, Bureau of Laboratories (334-2235), for rabies testing;
         (b)   Place the domestic animal under strict isolation or impoundment
while waiting for test results;
         (c)   If the rabies test of the wild animal is negative, release the
victim. If the victim animal is unvaccinated, recommend vaccination;
         (d)   If the rabies test of the wild animal is positive, and the dog,
cat, or ferret is appropriately vaccinated:
            1.   The dog, cat, or ferret may be euthanized and the head
submitted for rabies testing; or
            2.   The cat or dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian,
re-vaccinated at once, and placed under owner’s control for 45 days. Ferrets
must be re-vaccinated at once and placed under owner’s control for 90 days. All
domestic animals must be examined by a licensed veterinarian prior to being
released from the owner’s control.
         (e)   If the rabies test positive and the dog, cat, or ferret is not
appropriately vaccinated:
            1.   Unvaccinated ferrets must be euthanized and the head submitted
for rabies testing;
            2.   The dog or cat must be euthanized and the head submitted for
rabies testing; or
            3.   The dog or cat must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and
placed under strict isolation for six months. One month prior to the end of the
evaluation period, all cats and dogs should be re-examined and vaccinated by a
licensed veterinarian.
      (2)   If the wild animal is not available for testing. Any animal
potentially exposed to rabies virus by a wild, carnivourous mammal or bat that
is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to
rabies. The terms bitten or scratched have been eliminated from the statement
so that a more accurate evaluation can be made on the basis of the type of
contamination rather than the type of wound.
         (a)   If the dog, cat, or ferret is appropriately vaccinated:
            1.   The dog, cat, or ferret may be euthanized and the head
submitted for rabies testing; or
            2.   Dogs, cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should
be re-vaccinated immediately, kept under the owner’s control, and observed for
45 days. The dog, cat, or ferret must be examined by a licensed veterinarian
prior to being released from the owner’s control.
         (b)   If the dog, cat, or ferret is not appropriate vaccinated:
            1.   Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets should be euthanized and
the head submitted for rabies; or
            2.   The dog, cat, or ferret must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian and placed under strict isolation for six months. One month prior
to the end of the evaluation period, all cats, dogs, and ferrets should be
examined and vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian before being released; and
            3.   Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a
case by case basis.
   (F)   A wild animal bites livestock. Refer to the state’s Department of
Agriculture, Division of Animal Industries, at (208) 332-8540 for appropriate
action.
   (G)   A wild animal bites another captive wild animal.
      (1)   The victim animal should be euthanized;
      (2)   The victim animal should be impounded until it can be determined
whether the rabies suspect that bit the victim is infected or free of rabies.
If the rabies suspect animal is found to be free of rabies, the victim animal
may be released; or
      (3)   If the rabies suspect animal is unavailable for testing or is found
to have rabies, the victim animal should be euthanized at once.
   (H)   An animal exhibits unusual behavior, but no contact or bite occurred.
      (1)   Is the animal species susceptible to rabies (i.e., warm blooded):
         (a)   Yes, contact the state’s Department of Agriculture, Bureau of
Animal Health Laboratories, or the Department of Health and Welfare, Bureau of
Laboratories (334-2235), for agreement to test; or
         (b)   No, do not test animal.
      (2)   Livestock should be referred to the state’s Department of
Agriculture, Division of Animal Industries, at (208) 332-8540, for appropriate
action.
   (I)   Wolves and wolf hybrids. As quoted from the 1999 Rabies Compendium:
“As was reported last year, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
convened a meeting of taxonomists and other experts in April of 1996 in an
effort to resolve the issue of whether wolves and wolf hybrids are similar
enough to dogs to be included on the labels of rabies vaccines for dogs without
separate challenge studies. Although participants agreed that rabies vaccines
for dogs would probably protect wolves and their hybrids, there was some
concern about the safety of other vaccines, especially those with a modified
live component. If the labeling for rabies vaccines was expanded, that
expansion would also apply all other vaccines. USDA had therefore requested
that data on the safety of all vaccines, especially modified live, used on
wolves and wolf hybrids be provided to them for evaluation. USDA reported at
this meeting that progress had been made in soliciting data and they were
optimistic that some kind of decision would be made before the next meeting of
the Compendium Committee. The Compendium Committee has deferred any decisions
on the post-exposure management of wolves and wolf hybrids until the
vaccination issue is resolved.”
(Ord. passed 12-10-2001)
§ 90.29 REVISED ACIP BAT RABIES POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) STATEMENT.
   (A)   Bats are increasingly implicated as significant wildlife reservoirs
for variants of rabies virus transmitted to humans. Recent epidemiologic data
suggest that transmission of rabies virus may occur from minor or seemingly
insignificant bites from bats.
   (B)   The limited injury inflicted by a bat bite (in contrast to lesions
caused by terrestrial carnivores) and an often inaccurate recall of the exact
exposure history may limit the ability of health care providers to determine
the risk of rabies resulting from an encounter with a bat. In all instances of
potential human exposures involving bats, the bat in question should be safely
collected, if possible, and submitted for rabies diagnosis.
   (C)   (1)   Rabies PEP is recommended for all persons with bite, scratch, or
mucous membrane exposure to a bat, unless the bat is available for testing and
is negative for evidence of rabies.
      (2)   PEP may be appropriate even in the absence of demonstrable bite,
scratch, or mucous membrane exposure, in situations in which there is
reasonable probability that such exposure may have occurred (e.g., a sleeping
individual awakes to find a bat in the room, an adult witnesses a bat in the
room with a previously unattended child, mentally challenged person,
intoxicated individual, and the like).
   (D)   (1)   The likely effectiveness of PEP in this setting needs to be
balanced against the low risk such exposures appear to present.
      (2)   This recommendation, used in conjunction with current ACIP
guidelines, should maximize a provider’s ability to respond to situations where
accurate exposure histories may not always be obtainable, while still
minimizing inappropriate PEP.

         (a)   The grantors, their heirs, successors, and assigns acknowledge

in an agricultural area and may be subjected to conditions resulting from
commercial agricultural operations on adjacent lands. Such operations include
the cultivation, harvesting, and storage of crops and livestock raising and the
application of chemicals, operation of machinery, application of irrigation
water, and other accepted and customary agricultural activities conducted in
accordance with federal and state laws. These activities ordinarily and
necessarily produce noise, dust, smoke, and other conditions that may conflict
with grantors’ use of grantors’ property for residential purposes. Grantors
hereby waive all common law rights to object to normal and necessary

applicant’s property, and shall bind to the heirs, successors, and assigns of
grantors and shall endure for the benefit of the adjoining landowners, their
heirs, successors, and assigns. The adjacent landowners, their heirs,
successors, and assigns are hereby expressly granted the right of third party

records of the county and shall have a legal description of applicant’s
property attached thereto.
   (B)   The applicant for a building permit for erection or construction of
any new building, structure, or manufactured home in which water and/or sewer
is used therein shall include with the application, a list of all existing
animal confinement operation (“ACO”) facilities within one-half mile of the
applicant’s property. Prior to granting the building permit, the Planning and

designated in Ord. 1996-8, which defines and designates various types of roads
within the county.

attached thereto, is hereby incorporated herein by reference, as if fully set
forth herein. The “key” to the road map is also incorporated herein as part of
the road map and the different types of roads on the road map, which correspond
to the key, are given the definitions as set forth in section 2 of county Ord.

“primitive”, “unimproved”, or “seasonal and minimal upkeep” county roads, as
defined above, and submit a plan for an upgrade of said county road.

road up to standards adopted by the state, such that the county road would be
accepted by the state and be eligible for payment of gasoline tax revenues to
the county.

road, if accepted by the state, would generate sufficient additional state
gasoline tax revenue to cover the maintenance and upkeep of said road; or that
failing to do so, it would nevertheless contribute significantly to the
upgrading of the county road infrastructure such that it would be advisable, in
the sole discretion of the Board, to permit and authorize upgrading of said
road.
   (D)   All costs for engineering, construction, and upgrading of the county
road, to the standards set forth above, shall be paid by the petitioner. The
funds necessary for such work, as estimated by a licensed engineer, together
with an additional 20%, shall be deposited into a specially-designated county
fund for purposes of said construction.
   (E)   All engineering, bidding, construction, and upgrading of said county
road shall then be performed by the county, or a contractor employed by the
county, and all expenses shall be paid from the funds deposited as specified in
division (D) above. If the bid and other expenses exceed the amount deposited,
an additional deposit shall be required. If the deposited amount exceeds the
actual costs, the excess funds shall be returned to the petitioner.

§ 151.09 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Purpose. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the
Commissioners, as a result of unique circumstances, a variance from strict
compliance with specified provisions or requirements of this chapter or that
application of such provision or requirement is impracticable.
   (B)   Findings. No variance shall be favorable acted upon by the Commission
unless there is a finding upon recommendation by the Commission that all of the
following exists:
      (1)   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable. In such cases, the developer shall
first state his or her reasons in writing as to the specific provisions or
requirements involved; and
      (2)   Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would
result in extraordinary hardship or that these conditions would result in
inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter:
         (a)   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the
property is situated;
         (b)   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code;
         (c)   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the
interest and purpose of this chapter; and
         (d)   The fact that an owner or developer could realize a greater
financial return by use of this property that is contrary to these regulations
is not a sufficient reason for change. Hardship cannot be proved where it can
be shown that the property was purchased with the knowledge of existing
restrictions, nor can hardship be claimed in items of prospective sales or
potential customers.
(Ord. 1998-1, passed 1-26-1998)
§ 151.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   No manufactured home park or manufactured home unit required by this chapter
or the Idaho Code shall be titled, registered, or recorded by the county until
such manufactured home park or manufactured home units plans have received
final approval by the Commission. The Prosecuting Attorney shall, in addition
to taking whatever criminal action deemed necessary, take steps to civilly
enjoin any violation of this chapter. Before the Prosecuting Attorney shall
take any action, the Commission shall first authorize any civil action against
the party concerned.
(Ord. 1998-1, passed 1-26-1998)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, or corporation operating a manufactured home park or
manufactured home unit before the County Commissioners’ approval or violating
any of the terms or provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $300 or
imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute
a separate offense.

      (2)   In the event the development of the preliminary plat is made in
successive contiguous segments in an orderly and reasonable manner, and
conforms to the approved preliminary plat, such segments, if submitted within
successive intervals of one year, may be considered for final approval without
re-submission of preliminary plat approval.
   (K)   Action on combined preliminary and final plat.
      (1)   If the Commission’s conclusion is favorable to the developer’s

completed, a Design Engineer appointed by the Commission shall inspect the road
system and file a report with the Commission. The Commission may, after review
of this report, and upon finding that all private roads in the system are
complete as designed and reasonably constructed and having found that provision
has been made for continued maintenance by the developer and/or lot owners,
approve the private road system. This approval is not an acceptance of the road
as a dedicated public road.
         (c)   The developer must incorporate a provision in each prospectus,
sales contract, and deed detailing that the roads accessing the lots are
private, subject to tenant maintenance, are not accepted by the county, and
that the county is not responsible for construction, completion, or maintenance
of the roads in the event the roads are not completed or are unacceptable to
the lot purchasers for whatever reason.
         (d)   The developer must place the following words on the plat: “The
roads in the subdivision are private roads, are privately constructed and
maintained. Franklin County has no responsibility for construction,
maintenance, or snow removal upon or along these roads”.

within this chapter.
   (B)   Minimum area. A planned unit development for the following principal
uses shall contain an area of not less than:
      (1)   Three acres or one city block for residential use, except for a
mobile home subdivision;
      (2)   Five acres for mobile home subdivisions;
      (3)   Five acres for residential use with subordinate commercial use;
      (4)   Ten acres for commercial use; and

   (E)   Home owners’ association. The home owners’ association bylaws and
other similar deed restrictions, which provide for the control and maintenance
of all common areas, recreation facilities, or open space shall meet with the
approval of the Commission. Any and all power as specified in such agreements
may also be assigned to the Commission for the purpose of assessing property
for delinquencies and enforcement of motor vehicle speed to protect the best
interest of the owners involved and of the general public.
   (F)   Storage areas.

showing that the needs of a particular development are more or less.
   (G)   Parking space. One additional parking space shall be required for
every three dwelling units to accommodate visitor parking.
   (H)   Open space. The location of open space shall be appropriate to the
development and shall be of such shape and area to be usable and convenient to
the residents of the development.

development shall be required and a time limit may be imposed to guarantee the
development is built and constructed as planned.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
§ 152.111 SUBDIVISION WITH A FLOODPLAIN.
   (A)   Flood areas. For any proposed subdivision that is located with a
floodplain, the developer shall provide the Commission with a development plan
of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will show and explain at
least the following:
      (1)   Location of all planned improvements;
      (2)   The location of the floodway and the floodway fringe per
engineering practices as specified by the Army Corps of Engineers;

      (7)   Means of flood-proofing buildings; and
      (8)   Means of insuring loans for improvements within the floodplain.
   (B)   Justification for development.
      (1)   Upon the determination that buildings are planned within the
floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated within the
floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer shall
demonstrate conclusively to the Commission that such development will not
present a hazard to life, limb, or property; will not have adverse effects on
the safety, use, or stability of a public way or drainage channel or the
natural environment.
      (2)   (a)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees,
fill structures, or other features within the proposed subdivision will
individually or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights, or
damages.
         (b)   If only part of the proposed subdivision can be safely
developed, the Commission shall limit development to that part and shall
require that development proceed consistent with that determination.
         (c)   No sewage disposal systems or water supply sources shall be
located within a floodplain.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
§ 152.112 MOBILE HOME PARK AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARK.

(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
VACATIONS AND DEDICATIONS
§ 152.125 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   Any property owner desiring to vacate an existing subdivision, public right-
of-way, or easement, or desiring to dedicate a street right-of-way or easement
shall complete and file an application with the Commission. These provisions
shall not apply to the widening of any street or the dedication of streets,
rights-of-way, or easements to be shown on a recorded subdivision.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
§ 152.126 ACTION.

Commission shall establish a date for a public hearing and give such public
notice as required by law.
         (b)   The Commission may approve, deny, or modify the application.
         (c)   Whenever public rights-of-way or lands are vacated, the
Commission shall provide adjacent property owners with a quit claim deed for
the vacated rights-of-way in such proportions as are prescribed by law;
however, with regard to the vacation of county roads, state statutory law shall
prevail over the terms and conditions hereof.
      (2)   (a)   When considering an application for dedication procedures the
Commission may approve, deny, or modify the application.
         (b)   When a dedication is approved, the required street improvements
shall be constructed or a bond furnished assuring the construction prior to

         (c)   The owner shall furnish to the Commission a deed describing and
conveying such lands to be recorded with the County Recorder.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
VARIANCES
§ 152.140 PURPOSE.
   The Commission may recommend to the Commission as a result of unique
circumstances a variance from strict compliance with specified provisions or
requirements of this chapter or that application of such provision or
requirement is impracticable.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
§ 152.141 FINDINGS.
   No variance shall be favorably acted upon by the Commission unless there is
a finding upon recommendation by the Commission that all of the following
exists:
   (A)   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable. In such cases, the developer shall
first state his or her reasons in writing as to the specific provisions or
requirements involved;
   (B)   Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result
in extraordinary hardship or that these conditions would result in inhibiting
the achievement of the objectives of this chapter;
   (C)   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the property
is situated;
   (D)   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code;
   (E)   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest and
purpose of this chapter; and
   (F)   The fact that an owner or developer could realize a greater financial
return by use of this property that is contrary to these regulations is not a
sufficient reason for change. Hardship cannot be proved where it can be shown
that the property was purchased with the knowledge of existing restrictions,
nor can hardship be claimed in items of prospective sales or potential
customers.
(Ord. 95-3, passed 9-25-1995)
ANIMAL CONFINEMENT OPERATIONS
§ 152.155 APPLICATION TO INCLUDE ACOS.
   Prospective developers of all subdivisions, including minor subdivisions,
shall submit, as part of the initial application, all existing ACOs within one-
half mile of the parameters of the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 2002-4, passed 8-26-2002)
§ 152.156 NOTICE AND HEARING.
   Prior to approval of any subdivision whose parameters are within one-half
mile of an existing ACO, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall give notice
as required by law, and shall hold a hearing as required by law, to allow the
owners of such ACOs an opportunity to be heard prior to the approval of said
subdivision application.
(Ord. 2002-4, passed 8-26-2002)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   (1)   No subdivision plat required by this chapter or the Idaho Code
shall be admitted to the public land records of the county or recorded by the
County Recorder until such subdivision plat has received final approval by the
Commission. The Prosecuting Attorney shall, in addition to taking whatever
criminal action deemed necessary, take steps to civilly enjoin any violation of
this chapter. Before the Prosecuting Attorney shall take any action, the
Commission shall first authorize any criminal or civil action against the party
concerned.
      (2)   Any person, firm, or corporation using an unimproved and unrecorded
plat in the sale of subdivided land or violating any of the terms or provisions
of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be
punished by a fine of not more than $300 or imprisonment for not more than six
months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Any person convicted of violation of §§
152.155 and
152.156 is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable by imprisonment in the
county jail for a time not exceeding six months, or by a fine not exceeding
$300, or by both. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.

the enabling statute pursuant to which it is adopted, repeals conflicting
ordinances, establishes certain vested rights during the transition from the
previous ordinance, provides rules for the continuation of nonconforming uses,
and establishes rules for its interpretation.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to promote the health, safety,
and general welfare of the people of the county by fulfilling the purposes and
requirements of Idaho Code Title 67, Chapter 65 and implementing the
comprehensive plan. Specific statements of purpose accompany selected
provisions of this chapter, but the comprehensive plan provides the full
statement of the county’s purpose and intent in planning and zoning activities.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.002 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by the Local
Planning Act of 1975.
   (B)   It includes the zoning ordinance required by Idaho Code § 67-6511 and
the subdivision ordinance required by Idaho Code § 67-6513.
   (C)   It also fulfills the other requirements of the Local Planning Act,
including the provision for variances required by Idaho Code § 67-6516, the
adoption of procedures for processing permits required by Idaho Code § 67-6519,
and the adoption of a hearing procedure required by Idaho Code § 67-6534.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.003 VESTED RIGHTS.
    A vested right is the right to proceed with development under a previous
set of regulations, or the right to proceed under this chapter, pursuant to a
development agreement.
   (A)   Vested rights to proceed with development initiated prior to the
adoption of this County Development Code shall be established only by:
      (1)   Having previously received approval for a minor partition,
preliminary plat, and/or a final plat under the previous subdivision ordinance,
prior to the adoption of this Development Code;
      (2)   Having properly submitted a completed application for minor
partition, preliminary plat, or combined preliminary/final plat under the
previous subdivision ordinance, prior to the adoption of this Development Code
(applications will be deemed complete by the PZA); or
      (3)   Having properly recorded a minor partition or final plat prior to
the adoption of this Development Code.
   (B)   Vested rights to proceed with development under the provisions of this
chapter shall be established only by:
      (1)   Recording a final plat in full compliance with its provisions;
      (2)   Executing a development agreement in full compliance with its
provisions; or
      (3)   Obtaining a Class I, Class II or Class III permit in full
compliance with its provisions. Such vested rights expire with the permit.

§ 153.004 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A nonconforming use is a use that was in existence on the effective date of
this Development Code, but would not comply with one or more of its
requirements if submitted for approval after that date. Nonconforming uses may
continue subject to the rules established here. While the purpose of these
rules is to help eliminate nonconforming uses, it is recognized that routine
maintenance and repair and, in some cases, a change of occupancy to another
nonconforming use be necessary to prevent community blight.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.005 JURISDICTION.
   This Development Code shall apply to the subdividing and development of all
land within the un- incorporated areas of Franklin County, Idaho, including any
City Area of Impact, unless otherwise specifically negotiated and accepted by

on activities governed by this chapter, the most restrictive standard shall
apply.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.007 CONFLICT WITH PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.
   This chapter does not nullify easements, covenants, deed restrictions, and
similar private agreements; but where any such private agreement imposes
standards that are less restrictive than those adopted here, this chapter shall
apply.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.008 BURDEN OF PROOF.
   The burden of proof shall, in all proceedings pursuant to this chapter, rest

II, or Class III permit. The intent of this exemption is to allow development
of small parcels of non-productive isolated land thereby encouraging
development away from productive agricultural land; or

STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
§ 153.115 PURPOSE.
   This chapter explains the nature of the standards that are used as a basis
for the review of Class I and Class II permit application.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.116 ABSOLUTE STANDARDS; COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   The absolute standards require or prohibit certain kinds of performance in
developments. Failure to comply with any absolute standard shall result in
rejection of the application for a permit.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.117 ABSOLUTE STANDARDS; EXCEPTIONS.
   The only exceptions to the requirement for compliance with all absolute
standards shall be those specifically provided in this chapter and those
allowed by variance.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.118 RELATIVE STANDARDS.
   Relative standards address complex issues for which absolute standards are
inappropriate. They encourage or discourage certain kinds of performance in
developments through the use of the point- scoring system described herein.
   (A)   Importance factors.
      (1)   This chapter assigns an importance factor to each relative
standard.
      (2)   Importance factors range from one to five and reflect the
importance of the standard to which they are assigned in implementing the
comprehensive plan and in comparison with other relative standards.
      (3)   An importance factor of one is assigned to the least important
relative standards and an importance factor of five to the most important.
      (4)   Importance factors may be changed by amendment of this chapter
only.
   (B)   Point assignment. Point assignment provides a systematic technique for
assessing the implementation of the relative standards. A positive point
assignment reflects the successful implementation of a relative standard, while
a negative point assignment reflects a failure to implement a relative
standard. Points shall be assigned to each development on the basis of its
performance on each relative standard using these guidelines:
      (1)   Minus two points shall be assigned where there is essentially no
effort to implement the standard;
      (2)   Minus one point shall be assigned where there is an inadequate
attempt to implement the standard;
      (3)   Zero points shall be assigned where the standard is not relevant or
there is only minimally adequate implementation of the standard;
      (4)   Plus one point shall be assigned where there is a successful effort
to implement the standard; and
      (5)   Plus two points shall be assigned where there is an outstanding
effort to implement the standard.
   (C)   Relative standards. Relative standards may be designed to use the full
point range described here or strictly to discourage (using only negative point
assignments) or encourage (using only positive point assignments) certain kinds
of performance.
   (D)   Score. The importance factor of each relative standard is multiplied
by the points assigned to obtain a score.
   (E)   Cumulative score. Scores on individual relative standards are summed
to calculate a cumulative score. If that cumulative score is not zero or
greater, the application for a permit shall be disapproved.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019 ; Am. 2-28-2022)
§ 153.119 SMALL DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATION.
   Where a proposed development meets the following criteria, plus ten points
shall be added when scoring the development:
   (A)   The proposed development does not exceed ten lots;
   (B)   No new road construction or widening, either in or leading to the
development, is required or requested; and
   (C)   No major special development considerations are involved, such as
developments in floodplains, hillside development, or the like.

only) or public (dedicated to an agency that accepts responsibility for
maintenance) open space; and/or
      (2)   Retention of functional riparian vegetation, including its
protection during construction, on at least 90% of the stream frontage.
“Functional” riparian vegetation has the structure and species diversity needed
to serve the water quality, flood control, wildlife habitat, and/or aesthetic
functions on which the stream corridor protection strategy of the comprehensive
plan is based.
      (3)   The prohibition of all buildings, earthwork (cut/fill), and
construction within the 100-year floodplain (excluding habitat restoration/
enhancement activities).

§ 153.135 SLOPES.
   (A)    No structure shall be permitted on slopes of 30% or more. No
development shall be permitted on other slopes suspected to be unstable, unless
a qualified engineer certifies that such development creates no significant
hazard of slope failure or accelerated soil erosion.
   (B)   Open space use of slopes of 20% or more, or other slopes identified as
unstable, shall be encouraged. -2/+2 (4).
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019; Am. 2-28-2022)

scientific and engineering considerations, larger floods can and will occur;
      (2)   I understand that the projected flood levels at my development site
may be increased by human-made or natural causes;
      (3)   I understand that this chapter does not imply that land outside the
area of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damage; and
      (4)   I understand that this chapter does not create any liability on the
part of the county, of any officer or employee thereof, or on the part of the
Federal Insurance Administration for flood damages.
   (D)   Additional application requirements. All applications for permits in
the Floodplain Overlay Zoning District shall be accompanied by the following
information:
      (1)   Elevation of the lowest floor, including basements, of all proposed
buildings;
      (2)   Elevation to which any existing or proposed building has been or

      (3)   All buildings other than single-family dwellings, certification by
an engineer or architect that the flood-proofing methods used comply with these
performance standards;
      (4)   Where alteration of a watercourse is proposed, a description of the
extent to which the watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and proof that all state or federal permits required for
that alteration have been approved. The developer shall provide the base flood
elevation data for all subdivisions or other developments that include 50 or
more lots or dwelling units, or five or more acres; and
      (5)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to

   (A)   Site planning. Design and construction of all subdivisions and uses
for which a Class II permit is required shall minimize flood damage. Utilities
and structures shall be located and designed to minimize flood damage, and the
site shall be graded and drained to guide flood water around and away from
existing and/or proposed buildings.
   (B)   Residential development. All residential buildings shall comply with
the International Residential Building Code.
      (1)   Where base flood elevation data is not available through the flood
insurance study or from another source, applications shall be reviewed to
assure that the proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding.
This determination of reasonableness shall be based on evidence submitted with
the application by the developer, including historical flood records,
photographs of past flood events, and similar documentation. The minimum
elevation above grade in such cases shall be two feet.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either: be on
the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or be fully licensed and ready
for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
   (C)   Nonresidential development. All nonresidential buildings shall comply
with the International Building Code.
   (D)   Floodway. The floodway is the channel of a watercourse and any
adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
The FLOODWAY is a hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which
carry debris and potential projectiles and the high erosion potential.
Encroachments into the floodway, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, shall be prohibited unless an engineer or
architect certifies that the encroachment will not result in any increase in
the flood level during the base flood discharge.
   (E)   Maintenance of flood capacity. Continuing maintenance to prevent the
reduction of flood carrying capacity in altered or relocated watercourses shall
be required.
   (F)   Areas of shallow flooding. In these areas, base flood depth ranges
from one to three feet, a clearly defined channel does not exist, the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident.

§ 153.234 DIVISION III - VARIANCES IN THE FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT.
   (A)   Additional finding for variances. The approval of any variance in the
Floodplain Overlay Zoning District will not result in increased flood levels, a
threat to public safety, or extraordinary public expense.
   (B)   Notice of variance.
      (1)   Where a variance of the requirements of this is approved, the
Commission’s notice of the decision shall clearly state that the county is not
liable for any flood damages that result from the variance.
      (2)   Where a variance of the elevation requirements is approved, the
Administrator shall also notify the developer that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.

APPENDIX B: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS (Also known as cluster subdivisions)
   Introduction. Conservation subdivisions are a specific type of subdivision
in rural settings that is characterized by relatively compact lots and
preservation parcel(s), and where the natural features of land are maintained
to the greatest extent possible. There are also other ways to define and
develop conservation subdivisions for other settings. Generally, the building
lots in a subdivision are grouped or clustered on only a portion of a parcel of
land. The remainder of the site is called the preservation parcel.
   Conservation subdivisions are an alternative approach to the conventional
lot-by-lot division of land in rural areas which spreads development evenly
throughout a parcel with little regard to impacts on the natural and cultural
features of the area. Conservation subdivisions enable developers to
concentrate units on the most buildable portion of a site while preserving
natural drainage systems, preservation parcel, and environmentally and/or
culturally sensitive areas.
   Conservation subdivisions may not ensure protection of large blocks of
agricultural land, nor are they the best measures to protect farming as a
viable lifestyle; however, conservation subdivisions, when properly designed
and implemented, can protect small blocks of agricultural land and promote
areas where agricultural and residential activities can co-exist.
   Purpose. This appendix outlines the standards and requirements for
conservation subdivisions.
   Applicability. The conservation subdivision standards apply to subdivisions
of 20 acres or more, unless otherwise approved by the Commission.
   Procedures. A conservation subdivision requires a Class II or Class III
permit. All requirements of a Class II or Class III permit shall be met with
the following additions and exceptions.
   (A)   Sketch plan review. A sketch plan (also known as concept plan or pre-
application) review for all conservation subdivisions is strongly recommended
to allow the Commission to become familiar with the development and to discuss
the procedure for approval and design of a conservation subdivision. The sketch
plan should contain adequate information of the site, including, but not
limited to, natural features, critical areas, productive farm land, proposed
preservation parcels, and a general proposed lot and road layout.
   (B)   Preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall, in addition to the
requirements in
Appendix A, include:
      (1)   Natural resource features on the site, including, but not limited
to, wetlands, floodplains, watercourses, irrigation structures, canals,
ditches, existing wooded areas, steep slopes, drainageways, wildlife habitat
and corridors, livestock corridors, any public access through or adjoining the
property, and other prominent visual features;
      (2)   The proposed lots, roads, easements, preservation parcel(s),
trails, and the like;
      (3)   Proposed methods for, and location of, water supply, storm water
management, and sewage treatment;
      (4)   Inventory of preserved and disturbed natural features and prominent
views on or adjacent to the site;
      (5)   Preliminary building envelopes, if necessary for the protection of
sensitive areas and/or views; and
      (6)   Management plan for the long-term management of the preservation
parcel, including enhancement or restoration, if needed to achieve the purpose
of the preservation parcel conservation theme(s).
   (C)   Final plat. The requirements for the final plat shall be the same as
outlined in
Appendix A.
STANDARDS FOR DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS
   (A)   General considerations. Conservation subdivisions shall identify a
theme or themes for the subdivision. The theme(s) shall be identified at the
time of initial application. Conservation themes may include, but are not
limited to, forest stewardship, water quality protection, farmland
preservation, natural habitat restoration/preservation, view-shed preservation,
or archaeological and historic properties preservation. The Commission shall
have the ability to provide suggestions as to which areas shall be preserved.
   (B)   Residential lot requirements. Lot sizes may be reduced by one-half the
requirements in
Appendix A.
      (1)   Most lots shall take access from interior local roads.
      (2)   Lots shall be configured to minimize the amount of road length
required for the subdivision.
      (3)   Lots should be configured in a manner that maximizes the usable
area dedicated for the preservation parcel(s) with appropriate buffers between
the preservation parcel(s) and residential uses if feasible.
      (4)   Storm water management should maximize the use of open swales,
infiltration areas, and the like.
   (C)   Residential cluster siting standards.
      (1)   Residential clusters shall be located to minimize negative impacts
on the natural, scenic, and cultural resources of the site and conflicts
between incompatible uses.
      (2)   Residential clusters shall avoid encroaching on critical areas.
      (3)   Whenever possible, residential lots should abut upon, or have
direct access to the preservation parcel.
      (4)   Whenever possible, the preservation parcel shall connect with
existing or potential open space lands on adjoining parcels and local or
regional recreational trails.
      (5)   Residential clusters should be sited to achieve the following
goals, to the extent practicable:
         (a)   Minimize impacts to prime farmland soils and large tracts of
land in agricultural use, and avoid interference with normal agricultural
practices;
         (b)   Minimize disturbance to existing features, such as woodlands,
wetlands, grasslands, mature trees, and the like;
         (c)   Prevent downstream impacts due to runoff through adequate on-
site storm water management practices;
         (d)   Protect scenic views of open land from adjacent roads. Visual
impact should be minimized through use of building placement, landscaping, or
other strategies; and
         (e)   Protect archaeological sites and existing historic buildings or
incorporate them through adaptive reuse.
   (D)   Preservation parcel design.
      (1)   Preservation parcel. The uses within the preservation parcel shall
be accessible to the residents of the development. These uses may also be
available to the general public, if so designated and adequate public access is
provided. The required preservation parcel may be divided into more than one
parcel due to natural features and constraints of the parent parcel being
subdivided. A single dwelling unit may be allowed on one preservation parcel if
it does not impede the purpose of the preservation parcel.
      (2)   The preservation parcel shall be designated as part of the
development. The preservation parcel shall make up a minimum of 50% of the
gross acreage of the parent parcel.
      (3)   That portion of the preservation parcel designated to provide plant
and animal habitat should be kept as intact as possible. Roads, trails, and
other access should be designed in a manner that avoids fragmenting these
areas.
      (4)   Any pathway or trail system should be designed to connect
residential cluster areas to the preservation parcels.
      (5)   Preservation parcels and their theme(s) shall be compatible with
neighboring uses.
   (E)   Permitted uses for preservation parcels. The uses allowed on
preservation parcels include such uses as farming, conservation areas, a
single-family dwelling, private outdoor facilities for the subdivision, country
clubs, golf courses, non-ACO livestock uses including pastures, riding
facilities, stables, and the like. Other conditional uses may be permitted upon
consent of the Commission.
   (F)   Ownership of preservation parcels and common facilities. The ownership
of the preservation parcel must be by a method which will ensure the perpetual
protection and maintenance of the preservation parcel and prohibit further
development. The designated preservation parcel and common facilities may be
owned and managed by one or a combination of the following, providing approval
from the Commission is obtained.
      (1)   A homeowner's association. A homeowner's association shall be
established that requires mandatory membership for all purchasers of lots in
the development and their successors. A copy of the proposed homeowners
association bylaws, CCRs and the like shall be approved by the Commission
before final plat approval is granted.
      (2)   A non-profit conservation organization. If the preservation parcel
is to be held by a non- profit organization, the organization must be
acceptable to the county. The conveyance to the non-profit organization must
contain appropriate provisions for reversion in the event that the organization
becomes unwilling or unable to uphold the terms of the conveyance.
      (3)   Public dedication of the preservation parcel. The county may accept
the dedication of fee title or dedication of a conservation easement to the
common preservation parcel. The county may accept all or part of the
preservation parcel provided:
         (a)   The preservation parcel is accessible to the general public; and
         (b)   The county agrees to and has access to maintain the preservation
parcel.
      (4)   Private ownership. An individual, partnership, corporation, or any
other legal entity may hold fee title to the land for agricultural use or while
a non-profit conservation organization or other qualified organization holds a
conservation easement prescribing the acceptable uses for the preservation
parcel.
   (G)   Maintenance plan for preservation parcels and common facilities. Every
conservation subdivision must include a plan that provides evidence of a means
to properly manage the preservation parcel so it will support the conservation
theme(s) for which it was established in perpetuity and evidence of the long
term means to properly manage and maintain all common facilities. The plan
shall be approved by the Commission prior to final plat approval.
      (1)   The plan shall do the following:
         (a)   Designate the ownership of the preservation parcel and common
facilities in accordance with division (F) above;
         (b)   Establish necessary regular and periodic operation and
maintenance responsibilities;
         (c)   Estimate staffing needs, insurance requirements, and other
associated costs and define the means for funding the same on an on-going
basis; and
         (d)   Include a land stewardship plan specifically focusing in the
long-term management of the preservation parcel and facilities.
      (2)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
the preservation parcel and facilities, or any successor organization, fails to
maintain all or any portion of the common facilities in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the maintenance plan and all applicable laws,
rules, ordinances, and regulations, the county may serve written notice upon
such organization and upon the residents and owners of the preservation parcel
and common facilities, setting forth the manner in which the organization has
failed to maintain the common facilities in reasonable condition. Such notice
shall set forth the nature of corrections required and the time within which
the corrections shall be made. Upon failure to comply within the time
specified, the organization, or any successor organization, shall be considered
in violation of this chapter, in which case the county may enter the premises
and take corrective action.
      (3)   The costs of corrective action by the county shall be assessed
ratably in accordance with tax assessments, against the properties that have
the right of enjoyment of the common facilities and shall become a lien on said
properties. The county, at the time of entering upon such common facilities for
the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the Office of
the Recorder upon the properties affected by such lien.
   (H)   Amendments. Management plans can be amended by the owner(s) of the
preservation parcel with the approval of the Commission.

APPENDIX G: DETAILED STANDARDS FOR NOISE
   (A)   Maximum sound levels. No development that creates excessive levels of
sound beyond its property line shall be permitted. Excessive sound, measured at
the property line of the receiving use, exceeds the standards as established
within the following table.
 
Receiving Use              Maximum Sound Level
Residential and Commercial 80 dBA, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
                           50 dBA, 9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.
Note: “dBA” is the measure of sound levels in A-weight decibels.
 
   (B)   Applicability. This standard applies to sounds generated by the
occupancy or operation of a development, including sound generated by the
operation of trains, motor vehicles, and heavy equipment on the site. It does
not apply to the movement of trains on existing railroad rights-of-way, the
movement of motor vehicles on public roads, the operation of farm machinery,
the operation of water craft, or other sources of noise that are not
attributable to a particular development.
   (C)   Temporary exception. The maximum sound levels of the above table may
be exceeded by temporary construction and maintenance activities, but any
excessive noise generated by such activities shall be restricted to the hours
between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
(Ord. 2007-8-13, passed 3-11-2019; Am. 2-28-2022)
APPENDIX H: DETAILED STANDARDS FOR BUFFERING
   (A)   Purpose. Landscaping requirements are an essential element in
mitigating potential land use conflicts and enhancing the visual appeal of the
county. The purpose of this appendix is to assure that the landscaped buffers
required by these regulations effectively accomplish those goals.
   (B)   Minimum buffer requirements.
      (1)   The width of required buffers shall vary with the nature of the
uses being separated, the height of the buildings being separated, and the
construction of the buffer, as shown in the Table H-1. The basic buffer width
given in that table is the width required where the buffer consists of the
following:
         (a)   A level or gently sloping area of sod or ground cover;
         (b)   At least five major trees per hundred lineal feet of buffer,
where the drip line of mature trees will touch or just overlap; or
         (c)   At least ten shrubs per hundred lineal feet of buffer. Shrubs
are to have mature height of 36 inches or more. Ground cover has a mature
height of 35 inches or less.
      (2)   The table also shows where a security fence and/or a solid fence,
wall, or berm is required as part of a buffer.
   (C)   Height adjustment. The basic buffer width shall be increased by the
height adjustment factor, where one is established. The height adjustment
factor is a ratio expressing the number of feet that must be added to the basic
buffer width for each foot in height over 25 feet of the building being
buffered.
   (D)   Buffer width reduction: berms, walls, and fences. The basic buffer
width requirements may be reduced where a berm is included in the buffer. The
width reduction shall be twice the height of the berm, but the maximum
permitted reduction shall be ten feet. No berm shall have a slope of more than
three to one except where a retaining wall is incorporated into the berm on the
side opposite the use or public way being buffered. Berms, walls, or fences may
be required in cases where the potential nuisances being mitigated are noise or
dust/debris.
   (E)   Buffer width reduction: additional plantings. The basic width
requirements may be reduced where a greater density and diversity of plantings
is included in the buffer. The buffer width reductions permitted in this
section are cumulative and may result in a total reduction of up to 30%. The
buffer width reductions permitted are also cumulative with those permitted
here.
      (1)   Major trees. The required buffer width shall be reduced by 10%
where six or more major trees per hundred lineal feet are planted or retained.
      (2)   Shrubs. The required buffer width shall be reduced by 10% where 20
or more shrubs per hundred lineal feet are planted or retained.
   (F)   Minimum buffer width. No required buffer shall be less than half the
basic buffer width or less than ten feet in width, regardless of any reductions
permitted.
   (G)   Buffer crossings/inclusions. Buffers may be crossed by access
driveways, utility lines, sidewalks, and pedestrian trails. A sidewalk or
pedestrian trail may also run along the length of a buffer, with its width, up
to a maximum five feet, being included in the required buffer width. Buffers
may also include permitted signs.
   (H)   Plant materials specifications. Plant materials installed in required
buffers shall be warranted for one year and meet the following specifications.
      (1)   All trees shall be containerized or bagged and bur lapped stock in
good condition with a caliper of at least one and one-half inch, measured one
foot above grade, for deciduous trees, and a height of at least six feet for
coniferous trees.
      (2)   All shrubs shall be a minimum one-gallon containerized stock in
good condition with a mature height of 36 inches or more.
      (3)   Ground covers shall have a mature height of 35 inches or less.

APPENDIX I: DETAILED STANDARDS FOR GRAVEL MINING
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this appendix is to provide reasonable
assurance that gravel mining operations will not adversely affect neighboring
uses.
   (B)   Road capacity. No gravel mining shall be permitted where existing
roads and/or bridges do not have adequate capacity to support the anticipated
truck traffic.
   (C)   Buffer required. A buffer area of at least 50 feet wide shall be
provided between all operating areas of the mine, including parking, storage,
and the like, and the property line. No existing vegetation that has buffering
capacity shall be removed from a required buffer.
   (D)   Operating hours. Wherever a proposed gravel mine is within 660 feet of
an existing residence or a platted residential subdivision, mining operations
shall be limited to the daylight hours. The noise level at the property line
shall be limited to 70dBA.
   (E)   Groundwater protection. No gravel mine shall penetrate an aquifer. A
variance of this standard may be considered, but only where a professionally
prepared plan for the prevention of aquifer pollution is implemented. Any such
plan shall, at a minimum, require the diversion of surface runoff from the
excavation, the installation and maintenance of vegetative filter strips around
the excavation, and the minimization of the area of aquifer surface exposed at
any one time.
   (F)   Reclamation. The reclamation plan (reclamation plans are required by
Idaho Code §§ 47-1501 et seq.) for the gravel mine shall show how the site will
be reclaimed to a condition where it can be used for a compatible use.
Reclamation that fulfills the requirements of state law shall generally be
acceptable outside areas of city impact. In those areas of city impact where
there is a comprehensive plan, the reclaimed site shall be suitable for a use
permitted by that plan.

APPENDIX J: RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
   (A)   Purpose. The appendix provides a model for the resource management
agreements required upon all agricultural lands within the county.
   (B)   Resource management agreement. (“Grantors”) are the owners of real
property described as follows: In accordance with the conditions set forth in
the decision of Franklin County, dated (date), approving a Class I/Class II
permit for residential development on the above-described property, and in
consideration of such approval, grantors grant to the owners of all property
adjacent to the above-described property, a perpetual nonexclusive agreement as
follows:
      (1)   The grantors, their heirs, successors, and assigns acknowledge by
the granting of this agreement that the above-described property is situated in
an agricultural area and may be subjected to conditions resulting from
commercial agricultural operations on adjacent lands. Such operations include
the cultivation, harvesting, and storage of crops and livestock raising and the
application of chemicals, operation of machinery, application of irrigation
water, and other accepted and customary agricultural activities conducted in
accordance with federal and state laws. These activities ordinarily and
necessarily produce noise, dust, smoke, and other conditions that may conflict
with grantor’s use of grantor’s property for residential purposes. Grantors
recognize that all roadways in the county may serve as trails for the movement
of cattle and that the only protection from intrusion is a well-maintained
fence including gates and/or cattle guards. Grantors hereby waive all common
law rights to object to normal and necessary agricultural management activities
legally conducted on adjacent lands which may conflict with the grantor’s use
of the grantor’s property for residential purposes and grantors hereby grant an
agreement to adjacent property owners for such activities.
      (2)   Nothing in this agreement shall grant a right to adjacent property
owners for ingress or egress upon or across the described property. Nothing in
this agreement shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the grantors from enforcing
or seeking enforcement of statutes or regulations of governmental agencies for
activities conducted on adjacent properties.
   This agreement is appurtenant to all property adjacent to the above-
described property and shall bind to the heirs, successors, and assigns of
grantors and shall endure for the benefit of the adjoining landowners, their
heirs, successors, and assigns. The adjacent landowners, their heirs,
successors, and assigns are hereby expressly granted the right of third-party
enforcement of this agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the grantors have executed this agreement on
                          (date).

   (A)   Purpose. The appendix provides a model for the commercial operations/
development management agreements required upon all residential lands within
the county.
   (B)   Commercial operations/development management agreement.
   The word “adjacent” hereinafter refers to all property within 1,000 feet of
the attached described property.
   “Grantors” are the owners of real property described as follows: In
accordance with the conditions set forth in the decision of Franklin County,
dated                      for approval of a Class I/Class II permit for
residential development on the attached described property, and in
consideration of such approval, grantors grant to the owners of the all
property adjacent to or within 1,000 feet of the attached described property, a
perpetual nonexclusive agreements as follows:
      (1)   The grantors, their heirs, successors, and assigns acknowledge by
the granting of this agreement that the attached described property is situated
in a commercial operations/development area and may be subjected to conditions
resulting from commercial operations/development on adjacent lands. Such
operations/activities ordinarily and necessarily produce noise, dust, smoke,
and other conditions that may conflict with the grantor’s use of the grantor’s
property for residential purposes. Grantors hereby waive all common law rights
to object to normal and necessary commercial operations/activities legally
conducted on adjacent lands which may conflict with the grantor’s use of the
grantor’s property for residential purposes and grantors hereby grant an
agreement to adjacent owners of such activities.
      (2)    Nothing in this agreement shall grant a right to adjacent property
owners to ingress or egress upon or across the described property. Nothing in
this agreement shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the grantors from enforcing
or seeking enforcement of statutes or regulations of governmental agencies for
activities conducted on adjacent properties.
   This agreement is appurtenant to all property adjacent to the above-
described property and shall bind to the heirs, successors, and assigns of
grantors and shall endure for the benefit of the commercial operations
development’s adjacent landowners, their heirs, successors, and assigns. These
landowners, their heirs, successors, and assigns are hereby expressly granted
the right of third-party enforcement of this agreement.

APPENDIX L: SUBDIVISION AGREEMENT
   This Subdivision Agreement made and entered into this              day of
                  20         , by and between Franklin County, a body politic
of the State of Idaho hereinafter referred to as  “the county” and
                                      hereinafter referred to as the
“subdivider”.
WITNESSETH
   WHEREAS subdivider has applies to the county for final plat approval on a
subdivision entitled                                           , which is more
particularly described and identified on Exhibit A, attached hereto,
incorporated herein and made a part hereof, and
   WHEREAS, as a condition to approval of the subdivision, subdivider must
enter into an agreement with county; and
   WHEREAS the county is willing to approve the subdivision so that the same
may be recorded, but desires to ensure that the improvements required by the
ordinances of Franklin County are fully met;
   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained hereafter, the parties hereto agree as follows:
      (1)   The county does hereby approve the subdivision identified on
Exhibit A attached hereto, and does authorize the appropriate officers of the
county to sign the subdivision plat, showing their approval of the said
subdivision plat.
      (2)   Subdivider represents to the county that the improvements
contemplated in the subdivision, as evidenced in the plans and specifications
submitted with this contract, sealed and dated by                           
and approved by the County Road and Bridge Department on  , 20      , and made
a part of this contract by reference, are in full compliance with the county
subdivision ordinances. Subdivider agrees to install at his/her own cost as of
the improvements identified in the plans and specifications, which are
incorporated herein as a part of this agreement, and to have the said
improvements installed within 18 months from the date of this agreement. All
work shall be completed in a workmanlike manner and shall conform to the
Franklin County Highway Standards and Roadway Development Policy. In addition,
the sanitary sewer and water systems shall be in accordance with the
specifications and requirements of the Southeastern District Health Department.
It is expressly understood and agreed that nothing in this agreement shall
limit the responsibility of the subdivider to comply with all laws, ordinances,
and rules of regulations of the county.
      (3)   All work, as it is completed within the subdivision, shall be
inspected by the County Engineer. As the entire subdivision is completed, the
County Engineer will inspect the entire subdivision and certify to the Board
that the subdivision is complete.
      (4)   In accordance with the requirements of Appendix M - Surety
Agreements of the Franklin County Development Code relating to platting and
recording of subdivisions in the unincorporated area of the county, subdivider
shall furnish to Franklin County, upon execution of this agreement, a bond,
cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow arrangement in the amount
of                                dollars. The said sum represents at least 50%
of the engineer’s estimate of the cost of the improvement warranty within the
subdivision. The bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash or other surety shall
remain in effect until one year after the County’s Engineer certifies to the
Board that the subdivision has been completed.
      (5)   Subdivider hereby warrants and guarantees that the improvements
contemplated herein and any part thereof will remain in good condition for a
period of one year after the date the County Engineer certifies to the Board
that the subdivision is complete, and subdivider agrees to make all repairs to
and maintain the improvements and every part thereof in good condition during
the one-year period with no costs to the county.
      (6)   At any time during this agreement or the one year guarantee period,
should any of the improvements contemplated by the plans and specifications,
which are a part of this agreement, be in need of repair or be in any way
defective, the county shall notify subdivider of the needed repairs or the
defects, and subdivider shall correct the defects or make the repairs within 60
days from the date of the notice. In the event the subdivider fails to make the
needed repairs or correct the defects, the county shall be able to look to the
bond, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or other security for the money
needed to make the repairs or correct the defects.
      (7)   Time is of the essence in this agreement.
      (8)   This agreement is binding upon the heirs, administrators, and
assigns of the parties.
      (9)   In the event the subdivider defaults in any of the terms or
conditions of this agreement, the subdivider agrees to pay all costs of
enforcing this agreement, including, but not limited to, a reasonable attorney
fee, whether or not the matter is finally resolved by litigation.
   WHEREFORE, the parties hereto have signed this agreement the day and year
first written.

or savings and loan institution in an escrow account an amount of money equal
to at least 50% of the costs of the improvements required by this title not
previously accepted by the county. The costs of the improvements not accepted
and not installed or constructed shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator. The escrow agreement shall be subject to approval by the County
Attorney and shall be signed by the subdivider, the county, and the escrow
holder, and shall contain substantially the following language:
ESCROW AGREEMENT
   This Escrow Agreement made and entered into this          day of
                       , 20          , by and among Franklin County, body
politic of the State of Idaho, hereinafter referred to as “county”, and
                               , hereinafter referred to as “subdivider”, and
                          , hereinafter referred to as “Escrow Agent”.
WITNESSETH:
   WHEREAS, subdivider and county have entered into an agreement whereby
subdivider has agreed to install certain improvements within a subdivision
before being accepted by county; and
   WHEREAS, subdivider is willing to deposit with Escrow Agent funds sufficient
to complete the improvements contemplated by the Subdivision Agreement; and
   WHEREAS, Escrow Agent is willing to hold the funds deposited with it and to
release them upon the following terms and conditions.
   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained hereafter, the parties hereto agree as follows:
      (1)   Subdivider does hereby deposit with Escrow Agent for the benefit of
county the sum of                           , which represents at least 10% of
the estimated costs of the improvements to be installed in the proposed
subdivision of subdivider, his or her agents or employees.
      (2)   Subdivider and county hereby agree that the foregoing sums of money
shall be used exclusively for the purpose of paying for the costs of materials,
and construction and installation of the improvements required by the County
Development Code and that said improvements shall be installed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and in accordance with the
provisions of the County Development Code. In addition, county and subdivider
further agree that the money held by Escrow Agent shall be paid out to the
contractor installing and constructing the required improvements only upon an
order executed by the subdivider and by an authorized officer of the county.
      (3)    Escrow Agent does hereby agree to pay sums from the escrowed funds
only after having received an order signed by the subdivider and by an
authorized office of the county specifying the amount to be paid out of the
Escrow Account.
      (4)   County and subdivider agree that subdivider shall not withdraw from
the Escrow Account any amount in excess of 100% of the estimated costs of the
improvements, but subdivider agrees to pay from other sources any costs for
such improvements which exceed 100% of the estimated costs.
      (5)   The sum of 50% of the estimated costs of improvements shall remain
with the Escrow Agent for a period of one year after improvements are made and
completed. If, during that one-year period, the territory containing the
subdivision is annexed by a municipality, Franklin County reserves the right to
assign its interest in this agreement to the municipality.
      (6)   If, after one year after the improvements have been installed by
the subdivider, the required improvements have been maintained and remain
substantially free from latent defects, the county shall certify such fact to
the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall release to the subdivider any
funds still held in the Escrow Account, and the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from its obligation to the county and to the subdivider.
   WHEREFORE the parties hereto have signed this Escrow Agreement the day and
year first above written.

APPENDIX N: IDAHO’S ATTORNEY GENERAL’S TAKING CHECKLIST CRITERIA
   Agency or local government staff must use the following questions in
reviewing the potential impact of a regulatory or administrative action on
specific property. While these questions also provide a framework for
evaluating the impact proposed regulations may have generally, takings
questions normally arise in the context of specific affected property. The
public review process used for evaluating proposed regulations is another tool
that the agency or local government should use aggressively to safeguard rights
of private property owners. If property is subject to regulatory jurisdiction
of multiple government agencies, each agency or local government should be
sensitive to cumulative impacts of the various regulatory restrictions.
   Although a question may be answered affirmatively, it does not mean that
there has been a “taking”. Rather it means there could be a constitutional
issue and that the proposed action should be carefully reviewed with legal
council.
   (A)   Does the regulation or action result in a permanent or temporary
physical occupation of private property?
   Regulation or action resulting in a permanent or temporary physical
occupation of all or a portion of private property will generally constitute a
“taking”. For example, a regulation that required landlords to allow the
installation of cable television boxes in their apartments was found to
constitute a “taking”. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458
U.S. 419 S. Ct. 3164 (1982).
   (B)   Does the regulation or action require a property owner to dedicate a
portion of property or to grant an easement?
   Carefully review all regulations requiring the dedication of property or
grant of an easement. The dedication of property must be reasonably and
specifically designed to prevent or compensate for adverse impacts of the
proposed development. Likewise, the magnitude of the burden placed on the
proposed development should be reasonably related to the adverse impacts
created by the development. A court also will consider whether the action in
question substantially advances a legitimate state interest.
   For example, the United States Supreme Court determined in Nollan v.
California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 3141 (1987), that
compelling an owner of waterfront properly to grant a public easement across
his or her property that does not substantially advance the public’s interest
in beach access, constitutes a “taking”.
   Likewise, the United States Supreme Court held that compelling a property
owner to leave a public green way, as opposed to a private one, did not
substantially advance protection of a floodplain, and was a “taking”. Dolan v.
City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994).
   (C)   Does the regulation deprive the owner of all economically viable uses
of the property?
   If a regulation prohibits all economically viable or beneficial uses of the
land, it will likely constitute a “taking”. In this situation, the agency can
avoid liability for just compensation only if it can demonstrate that the
proposed uses are prohibited by the laws of nuisance or other pre-existing
limitations on the use of the property. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Conn., 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992).
   Unlike (A) and (B) above, it is important to analyze the regulations impact
on the property as a whole, and not just the impact on a portion of the
property. It is also important to access whether there is any profitable use of
the remaining property available. See Florida Rock Industries. Inc. v. United
States, 18 F.3d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The remaining use does not necessarily
have to be the owner’s planned use, a prior use, or the highest and best use of
the property. One factor in this assessment is the degree to which the
regulatory action interferes with a property owner’s reasonable investment-
backed development expectations.
   Carefully review regulations requiring that all of a particular parcel of
land be left substantially in its natural state. A prohibition of all
economically viable uses of the property is vulnerable to a takings challenge.
In some situations, however, there may be pre-existing limitations on the use
of property that could insulate the government from takings liability.
   (D)   Does the regulation have a significant impact on the landowner’s
economic interest?
   Carefully review regulations that have a significant impact on the owner’s
economic interest. Courts will often compare the value of property before and
after the impact of the challenged regulation. Although a reduction in property
value alone may not be a “taking”, a severe reduction in property value often
indicates a reduction or elimination of reasonably profitable uses. Another
economic factor courts will consider is the degree to which the challenged
regulation impacts any development rights of the owner. As with division (C)
above, these economic factors are normally applied to the property as a whole.
   A moratorium as a planning tool may be used pursuant to Idaho Code § 67-6523
– Emergency Ordinances and Moratoriums (written findings of imminent peril to
public health, safety, or welfare; may not be longer than 120 days); and Idaho
Code § 67-6524 – Interim Ordinances and Moratoriums; (written findings of
imminent peril to public health, safety, or welfare; the ordinance must state a
definite period of time for the moratorium). Absence of the written findings
may prove fatal to a determination of the reasonableness of the government
action.
   The Idaho moratorium provisions appear to be consistent with the United
States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the moratorium as a planning tool as
well. In Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council. Inc. et al. v. Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency et al., (Slip Opinion No. 00-1167, April 23, 2002); the Court
held that planning moratoriums may be effective land use planning tools.
Generally, moratoriums in excess of one year should be viewed with skepticism,
but should be considered as one factor in the determination of whether a taking
has occurred. An essential element pursuant to Idaho law is the issuance of
written findings in conjunction with the issuance of moratoriums. See Idaho
Code §§ 67-6523 to 67-6524.
   (E)   Does the regulation deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?
   Regulations that deny the landowner a fundamental attribute of ownership,
including the right to possess, exclude others, and dispose of all or a portion
of the property, are potential takings.
   The United States Supreme Court recently held that requiring a public
easement for recreational purposes where the harm to be prevented was to the
floodplain was a “taking”. In finding this to be a “taking”, the Court stated:
   The city never demonstrated why a public greenway, as opposed to a private
one, was required in the interest of flood control. The difference to the
petitioner, of course, is the loss of her ability to exclude others.... [T]his
right to exclude others is “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of
rights that are commonly characterized as property.” Dolan v. City of Tigard,
512 U.S. 374, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994).
   The United States Supreme Court has also held that barring the inheritance
(an essential attribute of ownership) of certain interests in land held by
individual members of an Indian tribe constituted a “taking”. Hodel v. Irving,
481 U.S. 704 S. Ct. 2076 (1987).
   (F)   Does the regulation serve the same purpose that would be served by
directly prohibiting the use or action; and does the condition imposed
substantially advance that purpose?
   A regulation may go too far and may result in a takings claim where it does
not substantially advance a legitimate governmental purpose. Nollan v.
California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 3141 (1987), Dolan v. City
of Tigard. 512 U.S. 374, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994).
   In Nollan, the United States Supreme Court held that it was an
unconstitutional “taking” to condition the issuance of a permit to land owners
on the grant of an easement to the public to use their beach. The Court found
that since there was no indication that the Nollan’s house plans interfered in
any way with the public’s ability to walk up and down the beach, there was no
“nexus” between any public interest that might be harmed by the construction of
the house and the permit condition. Lacking this connection, the required
easement was just as unconstitutional as it would be if imposed outside the
permit context.
   Similarly, regulatory actions which closely resemble, or have the effects of
a physical invasion or occupation of property, are more likely to be found to
be takings. The greater the deprivation of use, the greater the likelihood that
a “taking” will be found.

upland (non-riparian) vegetation due to their association with the surface and
subsurface hydrology of the stream corridor.
   SETBACK. All setbacks are measured at right angles from the nearest point on
the property line to the foundation or to any above grade projection of the
structure that extends more than three feet beyond the foundation.
      (1)   The FRONT SETBACK is measured from the lot line paralleling a
public road to the principal building. Corner lots have two front yards, but
may treat either as a side yard for the purposes of this chapter except where
the adjacent road is an arterial.

include enough specific information to allow the PZA and Commission to become
familiar with the development, its goals, and uses.
   SOLID WASTE. Material being stored, packaged, or processed for ultimate
disposal or recycling. For the purposes of this chapter, the waste normally
generated by a farming operation (crop stubble and residue, manure, and the
like) is not SOLID WASTE until transported from the farm on which it was
generated.

APPENDIX P: SEPTIC APPROVAL
   (A)    All Class I, Class II, and Class III permit applications must include
evidence acceptable to the county that each building lot is potentially
suitable for sewage disposal.
   (B)   This may be achieved by proof of a hook up with a municipality
connection or by doing one of the following:
      (1)   Retain a soils engineer to dig a test hole, evaluate for
suitability and submit a report;
      (2)   Retain a soil technician from the Soil Conservation District to dig
a test hole, evaluate for suitability, and submit a report; and
      (3)   Retain the Southeastern District Health Department to dig a test
hole, evaluate for suitability, and submit a report. (This choice may still
require the services of a Soil Engineer.)
