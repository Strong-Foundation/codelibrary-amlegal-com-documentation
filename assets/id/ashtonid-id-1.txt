otherwise, from the county for the purpose of protecting the guarantee fund.
After so acquiring title to real property, the city may lease or sell and
convey the same for such price and on such terms as may be determined by the
city council, and any provision of law or ordinance to the contrary

lesser sum than the city paid therefor. (1994 Code; Ord. 160 § 6, 1956)

guarantee fund at any time to pay any and all warrants, together with interest

improvement guarantee fund by transferring or appropriating to it, monies from
the general fund of the city or other available sources as may be determined by
the city council, subject, however, to the limitations prescribed in this
chapter. Warrants drawing interest as provided in this chapter may be issued
against said local improvement guarantee fund to meet any financial liability
against it; but at the time of making its next annual tax levy, the city shall
provide for the levy of a sum sufficient with other resources of the guarantee
fund to pay warrants so issued and outstanding, the tax for this purpose not to

In the event that the surety (or principal), within a reasonable time following
the giving of such notice (taking into consideration the circumstances of the
situation, the nature of the work, and the requirements of public safety and
for the protection of persons and property), fails either to commence and cause
a required work to be performed with due diligence, or to indemnify the city
for the cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, the city may use
its own forces or contract forces or both to accomplish the work, and suit may
be commenced by the city attorney against the contractor and bonding company
and such other persons as may be liable to recover the entire amount due to the
city on account thereof. In the event that cash has been deposited, the cost of
performing work may be charged against the amount deposited, and suit brought
for the balance due, if any. (Ord. 402 § 24, 2003)
12.16.250: OBSTRUCTIONS PROHIBITED:
It is unlawful for any person to place, cast, deposit, permit, erect, or suffer

harmless, and defend the city and its officers and employees against any and
all claims, loss, damage, or expense sustained on account of damages to persons
or property occurring by reason of any work made by the permittee, his
subcontractors or agents, whether or not the work has been completed. (Ord. 402
§ 26, 2003)
12.16.270: HOLD HARMLESS:
The permittee agrees to save the city, its officers, employees, and agents
harmless from any and all costs, damages, and liabilities which may accrue or
be claimed to accrue by reason of any work performed under the permit. The

by the permittee whether the same is expressed or not. (Ord. 402 § 27, 2003)
12.16.280: LIABILITY OF CITY:
This chapter shall not be construed as imposing upon the city or any official
or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any person injured
by, or by reason of, the performance of any work within the public way, or
under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; nor shall the city or any
official or employee thereof be deemed to have assumed any such liability or
responsibility by reason of inspections authorized hereunder, the issuance of
any permit, or the approval of any work. (Ord. 402 § 28, 2003)
12.16.290: STRUCTURES AND FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC WAY:
The city may direct any person owning or maintaining facilities or structures
in a public way to alter, modify, or relocate such facilities or structures as
the city may require. Sewers, pipes, drains, tunnels, conduits, vaults, trash
receptacles, and overhead and underground gas, electric, telephone, and
communication facilities shall specifically be subject to such directives. Any
directed by the city shall be based upon one of the following grounds: the
facility or structure was installed, erected, or is being maintained contrary
to law; the facility or structure constitutes a nuisance as defined under state
statute or city ordinance; the authority under which the facility or structure
was installed has expired or has been revoked; the facility or structure is not
in conformity with public improvements proposed for the area; or the public way
is about to be repaired or improved and such facilities or structures may pose
a hindrance to construction.
Any person owning or maintaining facilities or structures in the public way who
fails to alter, modify, or relocate such facilities or structures upon notice
to do so by the city shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. All costs of alteration,
modification, or relocation shall be borne by the person owning or maintaining
the facilities or structures involved. (Ord. 402 § 29, 2003)
12.16.300: PENALTY FOR WORK WITHOUT A PERMIT:

2003)
12.16.310: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
A violation of any provision of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor. Each day
the violation exists shall be a separate offense. No criminal conviction shall
excuse a person from otherwise complying with the provisions of this chapter,
nor shall relieve the person of the civil penalties which may be imposed. A
conviction under this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five
hundred dollars ($500.00), by imprisonment not to exceed ten (10) days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment, it being the intention of the city council
that violation of this chapter is an absolute liability offense. In case the
violation is by a firm, corporation, or similar entity, the manager or other
person in charge shall, prima facie, be held responsible and be punished as
provided in this section. (Ord. 402 § 31, 2003)

bill or bills. Subsequent bills shall be paid or placed on deposit in a similar
manner. Failure of the customer to make such a deposit shall warrant
discontinuance of service as provided under subsection F of this section.
   D.   Failure To Read Meters: In the event that it shall be impossible or
impractical to read a meter on the regular reading date, the water consumption
shall be prorated on the basis of thirty (30) days per month and the total
water consumption for billing purposes for that period shall be estimated.
   E.   Payment Of Bills: Each bill rendered shall contain the final date on

becomes delinquent, a turnoff notice may be sent to the customer. Said notice
shall state a date on which water will be turned off if delinquent account is
not paid in full prior thereto.
      4.   Service Turnoff: On the turnoff date, the meter reader or other
agent of the city shall deliver a written notice to the customer stating that

turn off the service. Delivery of notice to the premises served by the meter
reader shall be considered delivery to the customer.
      5.   Service Charge: In all instances where water has been turned off
because of delinquent accounts, a service charge shall be made for the
restoration of services and replacement of cash deposit, as stated in
subsection
13.04.050B of this chapter, will be required. The service charge for

days' notice, request the water department to test the meter servicing his
premises. The water department will require the customer to deposit the testing
fee. This fee shall be an estimate of the cost of testing the meter as
determined by the water superintendent. The deposit will be returned to the
customer if the test reveals the meter to over register more than two percent
(2%) under the standard test conditions; if less than two percent (2%) the
deposit shall be retained by the water department. Customers may at their
option witness any meter tests which they request.
      3.   On Water Department Request: If, upon comparison of past water
usage, it appears that a meter is not registering properly, the water
department may at its option test the meter and adjust the charges accordingly
if the meter either over registers or under registers. No charge for meter
testing will be made to the customer for the meter test under these conditions.
   C.   Adjustments Of Bill For Meter Error:

service by the water department shall give the water department written notice
of his intentions at least three (3) working days prior thereto, specifying the
date service is to be discontinued; otherwise, he will be responsible for all
water supplied to such premises until the water department shall receive notice
of such removal.
      2.   At the time specified by the customer that he expects to vacate the
premises where service is supplied or that he desires to be discontinued, the
meter will be read and a bill rendered which is payable immediately. In no case
will the bill be less than the monthly minimum specified in the schedule
applying to the class or classes of service furnished.
   B.   Nonpayment Of Bills: A customer's water service may be discontinued if
the water bill is not paid in accordance with the procedures listed in
subsection

not paid when due by any such person, firm or corporation whose premises are
served or who are subject to the charges herein provided, water service
provided to that customer by the city water department may be discontinued
because of the default in the payment of the sewer service charges. As an
additional alternative method, if such rates and charge are not paid when due
by any such person, firm or corporation, the amounts so unpaid may be certified
by the city recorder to the county assessor of Fremont County, Idaho, and shall
be by him assessed against the premises served as provided by law and shall be
collected and paid over to the city in the same manner as other taxes are
assessed, collected and paid over, with interest. Interest on unpaid bills

      1.   User Responsible For Compliance: The city shall not perform or be
liable for any inspection to determine if users' plumbing facilities conform to
the state of Idaho plumbing code. All users shall be required to bring their
own facilities into compliance with the code, performing such inspections as
the user deems necessary. The city shall have no liability for unsafe user
facilities or for failure of the user to bring such facilities into code
compliance.

health division and the U.S. environmental protection agency prohibit cross
connections.
         b.   The water department will not permit any cross connection and
will discontinue service to any persons or premises where a cross connection
exists. Service will not be restored until the cross connection is eliminated.
Customers using water from one or more sources in addition to receiving water
from the water department on the same premises shall maintain separate systems
for each; and the water department's water supply facilities shall be separated
from any and all other systems by an air gap of not less than one foot (1'), or
if in the ground, by not less than five feet (5').
   E.   Water Waste: Where water is wastefully or negligently used on a
customer's premises, seriously affecting the general service, the water
department may discontinue service if such conditions are not corrected after
due notice by the water department, after taking into consideration nature and
extent of waste.
   F.   Service Detrimental To Others: The water department may refuse to
furnish water and may discontinue service to any premises where excessive
demands by one customer will result in inadequate service to others.
   G.   Fraud Or Abuse: The water department will refuse or discontinue service
to any premises where it is deemed necessary to protect the water department
from fraud or abuse. Discontinuance of service from one or both of these causes
will be made immediately upon receipt of knowledge by the water department that
the condition or conditions exist.
   H.   Unauthorized Turn On: Where water service has been discontinued for any
reason and the water is turned on by the customer or other unauthorized person,
the water may then be shut off at the main or the meter removed. The charges
for shutting off the water at the main or removing the meter shall be computed
at actual cost to the water department plus fifteen percent (15%) overhead.
These charges shall be billed to the offending customer and water shall not be
furnished to the premises or customer until such charges are paid and the water
department has reasonable assurance that the violation will not reoccur.

equipment on the customer's premises remains the property of the department and
may be repaired, replaced or removed by the department employees at any time
without consent of the customer. No payment will be made to the property owner
for the right to install, maintain, replace or remove water department
equipment on his premises. The property owner must keep vicious dogs or other
animals secured or confined to avoid interference with the utility operations
and maintenance.
   C.   Damage To Water Department Equipment: The customer shall be liable for
any damage to equipment owned by the water department which is caused by an act

to law. No tool other than special hydrant wrenches shall be used to operate a
hydrant valve. In cases where a temporary service has been granted and receives
water through a fire hydrant, an auxiliary external valve will be provided to
control the flow of water.
   B.   Moving A Fire Hydrant: When a fire hydrant has been installed in the
locations specified by the proper authority, the water department has fulfilled
its obligation. If a property owner or other party desires to change the size,
type or location of the hydrant, he shall bear all costs of such changes. Any
changes in the location of a fire hydrant must be approved by the water
department and the fire department. (Ord. 350 § 18, 1993)

13.04.200: SUSPENSION OF RULES:
No employee of the water department is authorized to suspend or alter any of
the policies, rules and regulations cited in this chapter without specific
approval or direction of the city council, except in cases of emergency
involving loss of life or property or which would place the water system
operation in jeopardy. (Ord. 350 § 20, 1993)
13.04.210: EASEMENT:
Each applicant and user gives and grants to the city an easement and right of
way on and across his property for the installation of water mains and the

13.04.220: PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR UTILITY CHARGES; EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Any charges for use of municipal water, wastewater collection and
treatment, street lighting services and solid waste collection and
transportation shall be the legal responsibility of the property owner of
record. From the effective date of this section, each municipal utility account
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property served by the city.
Each property owner shall execute such documentation as may be required by the
city as a condition of receiving continuing utility service. The city may allow
the party responsible for payment of such utility charges on the date of
enactment of this section to remain responsible therefor until an unremedied
delinquency occurs or until a new primary payer is proposed. For utility
accounts which have been paid by a tenant, the owner of said property may
continue to have the tenant continue to pay so long as the owner agrees to
serve as guarantor of such accounts in the event of nonpayment by the
authorized tenant. If a tenant becomes delinquent in payment of a utility
account such that service is discontinued by the city, no subsequent tenant
shall be authorized to initiate service at such location or address until all
delinquent charges and assessments have been paid in full. Further, in the
city's sole discretion the city may require an increased deposit or security
guarantee upon evidence of any delinquency or failure of past performance.
   B.   The finance director may waive, in writing, the requirement that the
underlying property owner be responsible to guarantee payment of commercial
utility charges upon a showing by a commercial tenant that it is creditworthy
and/or upon the maintenance of a deposit deemed adequate to assure payment of
utility charges to be incurred. In order to confirm information of
creditworthiness, the finance director may require a credit report at the
expense of the tenant or property owner and such other evidence of
creditworthiness as the finance director deems reasonably necessary. The waiver
of owner responsibility authorized above must be requested by the owner and
must list the name and address of tenant for whom it is requested. Any such
waiver will only remain in effect for the duration of the tenancy of the tenant
named in the waiver. Any subsequent request for waiver by a property owner for
a different tenant shall require a new application. Further, for commercial
accounts, the finance director is authorized to establish deposit requirements
and amounts in whatever amount deemed reasonably necessary to assure payment of
the utility charges in question. At any time the finance director may give
notice to the property owner that a guarantee waiver has been revoked and that
the guarantee requirements of this code have been reinstated. The city
administrator and finance director are authorized to take such steps as may be
necessary to implement the provisions of this section. (Ord. 401 § 1, 2003)
13.04.230: UTILITY DEPOSITS AND SERVICE FEES FOR DELINQUENCY OR DISCONNECTION:
   A.   A utility deposit in an amount to be established by resolution of the
city council shall be paid to the treasurer for every new service or connection
to the water system. A deposit shall also be required on each occasion that the
utility account is past due for forty five (45) days or more. The deposit shall
be returned after one year of on time payments or when the service is
discontinued, whichever is first. Return of the deposit at the termination of
service shall include a setoff of any unpaid utility charges then due the city.
Further, the finance department of the city is authorized to charge additional
service fees, to be set by resolution of the city council, when utility
accounts have become delinquent through nonpayment or when specific services
are made necessary because of disconnection of service on either voluntary or
involuntary grounds. Rate adjustments based upon economic necessity and will-
pay agreements are authorized hereby.
   B.   There shall be charged for every water connection to the water main of
the city, where there has been no prior service to the land, premises or
building for which the connection is made or where an increase in demand due to
a change in use or water requirement is effected and for the installation of a
water meter, a hook up fee in such amount as shall be determined by the city
council and approved by resolution set forth in the minutes of the meeting at
which the fee is opted. (Ord. 401 § 1, 2003)
13.04.240: LIEN; WHEN:
All water charges shall constitute a lien upon the property to which service is
made, and the clerk shall certify to the county treasurer, at the same time as
other levies are certified, the amount of unpaid water charges upon each parcel
of property within the city. (Ord. 401 § 1, 2003)

CHAPTER 17.04
PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION:
17.04.010: Purpose
17.04.020: Authority
17.04.030: Conflicting Ordinances Repealed
17.04.040: Vested Rights
17.04.050: Nonconforming Lots
17.04.060: Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, And Signs
17.04.070: Most Restrictive Standards Apply
17.04.080: Conflict With Private Agreements
17.04.090: Burden Of Proof
17.04.100: Interpretation
17.04.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter establishes the purpose of this title, identifies the enabling
statute pursuant to which it is adopted, repeals conflicting ordinances,
establishes certain vested rights during the transition from the previous
ordinance, provides rules for the continuation of nonconforming uses, and
establishes rules for its interpretation.
The purpose of this title shall be to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of Ashton by fulfilling the purposes and requirements of
the local land use planning act of 1975 and implementing the comprehensive
plan. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.020: AUTHORITY:
This title is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by the local land use
planning act of 1975. It includes the zoning ordinance required by Idaho Code
67-6511 and the subdivision ordinance required by Idaho Code 67-6513. It also
fulfills the other requirements of the local land use planning act, including
the provision for variances required by Idaho Code 67-6516, the adoption of
procedures for processing permits required by Idaho Code 67-6519, and the
adoption of a hearing procedure required by Idaho Code 67-6534. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.04.030: CONFLICTING ORDINANCES REPEALED:
All prior ordinances are repealed to the full extent of their inconsistency
with this title. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.040: VESTED RIGHTS:
A "vested right" is the right to proceed with development under a previous set
of regulations, or the right to proceed under this title, pursuant to a
development agreement.
   A.   Vested rights to proceed with development initiated prior to the
adoption of this title shall be established only by:
      1.   Having obtained a building permit in full compliance with the
provisions of the previous regulations (such vested rights expire with the
permit); or
      2.   Having recorded a final plat in full compliance with the provisions
of the previous regulations. Recording a final plat establishes a vested right
to the lot layout and street network of the subdivision. It does not establish
a vested right for any particular use or development of any lot.
   B.   Vested rights to proceed with development under the provisions of this
title shall be established only by:
      1.   Recording a final plat in full compliance with its provisions;
      2.   Executing a development agreement in full compliance with its
provisions; or
      3.   Obtaining a class I or class II permit in full compliance with its
provisions. Such vested rights expire with the permit. See section
17.16A.110 of this title on the duration of permit approvals. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.04.050: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
A "nonconforming lot" is a separate parcel of land that existed on the
effective date hereof, but is too small to serve as a building lot.
   A.   Consolidation of adjacent nonconforming lots to create conforming lots
shall be required wherever such lots are in the same ownership. Nonconforming
lots that are not subject to consolidation may be divided only in order to
enlarge adjoining, conforming lots. Where such divisions are made in a platted
subdivision, the plat shall be amended.
   B.   Where the only requirement of this title preventing construction of one
one-family dwelling on a nonconforming lot that is not subject to
consolidation, as required by subsection A of this section, is the minimum lot
size, the administrator shall issue a class I permit for one one-family
dwelling. Where other requirements of this title make construction of one one-
family dwelling on such a lot infeasible, the planning and zoning commission
shall accept small lot size as the basis for the minimum variances needed to
permit construction of one one-family dwelling. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.060: NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS, AND SIGNS:
A nonconforming use, building, or sign was in existence on the effective date
of this title, but would not comply with one or more of its requirements if
submitted for approval after that date. Nonconforming uses, buildings, and
signs may continue subject to the rules established herein. While the purpose
of these rules is to help eliminate nonconforming uses, buildings, and signs,
it is recognized that routine maintenance and repair and, in some cases, a
change of occupancy to another nonconforming use or replacement of a
nonconforming building or sign may be necessary to prevent community blight.
   A.   Any nonconforming use or sign abandoned for more than eighteen (18)
months shall be terminated. Abandonment shall not be measured by the owner's
intent, but solely by the fact that use ceases for a period of eighteen (18) or
more months.
   B.   There shall be no limit on repair or maintenance activities for
nonconforming uses, buildings, or signs, provided that no such activity shall
increase the degree of nonconformity.
   C.   Changes in occupancy may be permitted in nonconforming commercial or
industrial buildings, provided that the new occupancy is no more intense (with
intensity being measured by traffic and noise generation, parking requirements,
and similar factors) than the existing. Requests for such changes in
nonconforming occupancies shall be processed as applications for class II
permits.
   D.   Nonconforming buildings and signs may be replaced, but only where the
effect of the replacement is to lessen the adverse impact of the nonconformity
on the community, and where the degree of nonconformity is not increased.
Requests for replacement of nonconforming buildings shall be processed as
applications for class II permits, except that any nonconforming building
destroyed by fire or other catastrophe may be replaced without a permit (a
permit may be required by the adopted building code), if the degree of
nonconformity is not in any way increased and if the replacement is completed
within twelve (12) months of the building's destruction. No permit is required
for replacement of a nonconforming sign. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.070: MOST RESTRICTIVE STANDARDS APPLY:
When future ordinances, or state or federal law, impose additional standards on
activities governed by this title, the most restrictive standard applies. (Ord.
459-13, 2013)
17.04.080: CONFLICT WITH PRIVATE AGREEMENTS:
This title does not nullify easements, covenants, deed restrictions, and
similar private agreements, but where any such private agreement imposes
standards that are less restrictive than those adopted herein, this title shall
apply. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.090: BURDEN OF PROOF:
It is the developer's responsibility to demonstrate compliance with this title.
(Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.04.100: INTERPRETATION:
All title provisions shall be interpreted as the minimum requirements necessary
to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and to implement the
local land use planning act and comprehensive plan. This title is designed for
consistency with the comprehensive plan and should be liberally construed to
achieve that plan's purposes and intent. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

provide for future resubdividing to urban densities and shall be included on
the final plat.
   F.   City road widths and profiles found in this code, including all
amendments thereto, shall apply within the impact area, except where improved
standards of the county differ from those of the city, the provisions imposing
the highest level of improvements shall prevail.
   G.   A condition of approval for all subdivision plats in the impact area
shall require that: 1) prior to occupancy of the subdivision's first dwelling
unit, sewer and water lines shall be installed to accommodate the future
resubdivision to urban densities; and 2) development agreements be in place.

   A.   All applications for subdivision plats and all other applications
(e.g., zone change, comprehensive plan amendments, variance, conditional use,
etc.) within the impact area shall be filed by the applicant with Fremont
County. All public hearings in the impact area shall be held before the county
and city.
   B.   It is the intent of this section that the processing of subdivisions be

improvement standards, including, but not limited to, water, sewer and roads.
City infrastructure standards shall apply to all subdivisions in the area of
impact. In furtherance thereof, applicants for preliminary plat approval shall
solicit comments and recommendations from the city in the same manner as they
are required to solicit the same from other agencies and districts.
   C.   Within the impact area, the county will provide the city notice of any
public hearing related to an application to the county or the county's planning
commission for a zone change, comprehensive plan change, request for a special

remain in effect until this chapter is amended or a substitute ordinance is
adopted by the city and county, in accordance with the notice and hearing
procedures provided in the county and state codes, or until a declaratory
judgment from the district court is final. Provided, however, that this chapter
or stipulated portions thereof shall be of no further force and effect if both

packaging of materials for any reason, including the long term storage of
construction materials and inoperative machinery or vehicles, that are not
enclosed in a building and that are visible from a public street.
PLAT: The legal map of a subdivision. A "plat amendment" is a minor change in
the lot arrangement or routing of rights of way or easements in a previously
recorded subdivision plat. It may result in the consolidation of lots, but does
not result in the creation of any additional lots or parcels, or the addition
of land to the subdivision. Plat amendments are instituted by the recording of
an amended plat following the process provided in section
17.52C.010 of this title.

SITE PLAN: A scale drawing, or a series of such drawings, that illustrates all
those details of a proposed development needed to demonstrate compliance with
this title, including the location of existing and proposed property lines,
easements, buildings, parking areas, streets, sidewalks, landscaped buffers,
and other features of the site. Where an erosion and runoff control plan is
required, the site plan must be prepared on a detailed (contour intervals of 2
feet) topographic base.
SKETCH PLAN: A general or conceptual site plan of a development. It must
include the approximate location of all lot lines and streets, the approximate
location and exterior dimensions of all structures, the approximate location,
size, and circulation pattern of all parking areas, and the approximate
location and dimensions of all landscaped buffers.
SOLID WASTE: Material, including vehicles, being stored, packaged, or processed
for ultimate disposal or recycling. For the purposes of this title, the waste
normally generated by a farming operation (crop stubble and residue, manure,
etc.) is not solid waste until transported from the farm on which it was
generated.
STANDARD LAND USE CODE (SLUC): The standard land use code is a method of
classifying land uses adapted from the "Standard Land Use Coding Manual", U.S.
department of transportation, federal highway administration, as reprinted in
March 1977. A summary appears in table 4 attached to ordinance 387.
STRUCTURE: Any object, including any mobile object, constructed or installed by

divided, which creates more than one additional contiguous or adjacent parcel
containing one hundred sixty (160) acres or less, in order that the title to or
possession of the parcels may be sold, rented, leased, or otherwise conveyed,
and shall include any replat or any condominium. A subdivision requires a class
II permit (see subsection
17.16A.010B of this title). Note that creation of a single parcel of one
hundred sixty (160) acres or less requires a class I permit (see subsection
17.16A.010A of this title).
UPLIT: Uplighting occurs when signs or structures are illuminated by a
spotlight shining on them from below.
USE: See definition of Occupancy. The terms are synonymous.
VACATION: The process provided by state law 1  and this title (see section
17.16F.010 of this title) for the elimination of a recorded subdivision plat.
VARIANCE: According to Idaho Code 67-6516, "A variance is a modification of the
requirements of the ordinance as to lot size, lot coverage, width, depth, front
yard, side yard, rear yard, setbacks, parking space, height of buildings, or
other ordinance provision affecting the size or shape of structure or the
placement of the structure upon lots, or the size of lots". Land use cannot, by
definition, be varied.
VESTED RIGHT: The right to proceed with development under a previous set of
regulations, or the right to proceed under this title, pursuant to a
development agreement. See section
17.04.040 of this title.
YARD: The area between the lot lines and the principal building created by the
required setbacks. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

inspection. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.16A.070: CLASS I PERMIT PROCEDURE:
The class I permit procedure provides for the prompt review of minor
developments and plat amendments, while assuring they have no significant
adverse impact on environmental quality, neighboring uses, or public facilities
and services. The class I permit procedure shall be as follows:
   A.   Filing: The developer shall file a properly completed permit
application form, the required supporting materials, and the required
application fee with the administrator.
   B.   Compliance Determination: The administrator shall determine whether the
proposed development is in compliance with the comprehensive plan and this
title. If the proposed development complies, the application for a permit shall
be approved. If the proposed development fails to comply, the application for a
permit shall be disapproved. Where the proposed development is part of a larger
development for which a class II permit was previously approved, the
administrator shall also determine whether it is in compliance with the
previously approved development plan and all conditions attached to that
approval. Conditions may be attached to approval of any permit, as provided in
section
17.16A.090 of this article.
   C.   Notification Of Decision: The administrator shall notify the developer
of the decision within ten (10) days, except as provided in subsection F of
this section.
   D.   Appeal: The administrator's decision on a proposed development or plat
amendment may be appealed to the commission using the appeals procedure of
section
17.16B.010 of this chapter. A notice of any such appeal shall be filed with the
administrator within ten (10) days after notice of the decision has been
issued. Developers proceed at their risk during the appeal period.
   E.   Additional Procedures For Plat Amendments:
      1.   The administrator shall determine: a) whether all lots resulting
from the proposed plat amendment are capable of accommodating a use permitted
by this title, and b) whether the proposed amendment affects street or
utilities access to any adjoining lot or parcel. If the lots resulting from the
proposed plat amendment are capable of accommodating such a use and the
amendment does not adversely affect access to any adjoining lot or parcel, the
administrator shall approve the application for a permit and place the proposed
plat amendment on the agenda of the next regular council meeting at which time
will permit its proper review. If the lots resulting from the proposed plat
amendment are not capable of accommodating such a use, or the amendment
adversely affects access to a lot or adjoining parcel, the administrator shall
disapprove the application for a permit.
      2.   Plat amendments approved by the administrator shall be reviewed by
the council which, if it affirms the administrator's findings, shall sign the
amended plat.
   F.   Referral: Upon finding that a proposed development or plat amendment
will have a significant adverse impact on environmental quality, neighboring
land uses, or public facilities and services, the administrator may refer any
application for a class I permit to the commission. The commission may, upon
confirming the administrator's finding, require that the application for a
class I permit be converted to an application for a class II permit. Such
referrals shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular commission meeting.
(Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.16A.080: CLASS II PERMIT PROCEDURE:
The purpose of the class II permit procedure is to assure effective regulation
of developments that may have significant impacts on public facilities,
environmental quality, or neighboring uses. The class II permit procedure shall
be as follows:
   A.   The developer shall file a request for sketch plan review with the
administrator at least five (5) days before the meeting at which the review is
requested.
      1.   The administrator shall place the sketch plan on the agenda of the
next regular commission meeting at which time will permit its proper review.
      2.   The commission shall conduct a sketch plan review. A sketch plan
review is not a regulatory proceeding, but an opportunity for the commission to
be made aware of the proposal and for the developer to be made aware of
possible questions and the applicable requirements of this title.
   B.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form, the
required supporting materials, and the required application fee with the
administrator at least thirty (30) days before the commission meeting at which
a hearing on the application is requested.
   C.   The administrator shall place a hearing on the application on the
agenda of the next regular commission meeting for which the notice requirements
of subsection E of this section can be met, and at which time will permit its
proper review.
   D.   The administrator may contract for professional review of the
application, with the cost of that review being covered by the application fee.
Such reviews shall be prepared in the form of a written report submitted to the
administrator for use at the hearing. The administrator shall, upon its
receipt, provide a copy of this report to the developer and place it on file
for public review with the other application materials.
   E.   The content of all hearing notices shall comply with the requirements
of section
17.16A.100 of this article. Notice shall be provided, as follows:
      1.   By first class mail; to all owners of record of property within
three hundred feet (300') of the site, at least fifteen (15) days before the
hearing;
      2.   By newspaper publication; two (2) legal notices in the official
newspaper, with the first newspaper notice appearing at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing and the second one week later;
      3.   By first class mail; to all potentially affected public agencies,
including the appropriate school and fire protection districts, and other
interested parties on a list maintained by the administrator; and
      4.   By posting; at least seven (7) days before the hearing, a sign
conveying the required notice shall be placed on the site. Such signs shall be
clearly visible from the nearest public street and may be placed at a point of
access to the site, rather than on the site where the administrator determines
that so doing will provide more effective notice.
      5.   The actual cost of mail and newspaper notice shall be in addition to
the application fee required by section
17.16A.050 of this article. No permit shall be issued until payment is
received.
   F.   The commission shall conduct a hearing on the proposed development
following the procedure established in section
17.16C.010 of this chapter. No application shall be reviewed if the developer
or a representative is not present.
   G.   The commission shall determine whether the proposed development is in
compliance with the comprehensive plan and all requirements of this title. If
the proposed development complies, the application for a permit shall be
approved. If the proposed development fails to comply, the application for a
permit shall be disapproved. Conditions may be attached to approval of any
permit, as provided in section
17.16A.090 of this article.
   H.   The administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties of
the commission's decision within ten (10) days.
   I.   The commission's decision may be appealed to the council using the
appeals procedure of section
17.16B.010 of this chapter. A notice of any such appeal shall be filed with the
administrator within ten (10) days after notice of the decision has been
issued. Developers proceed at their own risk during this appeals period.
   J.   The developer may file a final plat with the administrator at any time
after the class II permit for a subdivision is approved. Phased final platting
is permitted by section
17.68.050 of this title.
      1.   The administrator shall place the final plat on the agenda of the
next commission meeting.
      2.   No public notice or hearing is required for final plats, but no
final plat shall be reviewed if the developer or a representative is not
present.
      3.   The commission shall review the final plat and determine whether it
is in compliance with the subdivision permit, the comprehensive plan, and this
title. If it finds that the final plat complies, it shall approve that plat and
recommend that it be signed by the council. If it finds that the final plat
fails to comply, it shall disapprove that plat and recommend that it not be
signed by the council. Conditions may be attached to approval of a final plat,
as provided in section
17.16A.090 of this article.
      4.   If the commission approves the final plat, the administrator shall
place it on the agenda of the next regular council meeting. Commission
disapproval of a final plat may be appealed to the council using the appeals
procedure of section
 17.16B.010 of this chapter. A notice of any such appeal shall be filed with
the administrator within ten (10) days after notice of the decision has been
issued.
      5.   The council shall determine whether the final plat is in compliance
with the subdivision permit, the comprehensive plan, and this title. If it
finds that the final plat complies, it shall approve that plat. If it finds
that the final plat fails to comply, it shall disapprove that plat. Conditions
may be attached to council approval of a final plat, as provided in section
17.16A.090 of this article.
      6.   The administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties
of the council's decision within ten (10) days. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.16A.090: CONDITIONS:
Conditions may be imposed on the approval of any permit or variance, provided
those conditions are clearly designed to assure compliance with one or more
specific requirements of this title, and that a list of all conditions imposed
is provided to the developer with notification of the commission's or council's
decision. That list shall specifically identify the provision of this title the
condition is designed to implement. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.16A.100: HEARING NOTICES:
   A.   Required Information: All required notices shall provide the following
information: the name and mailing address of the developer; a legal description
of the development site; the address of the development site, or another
general description by which the public can identify the site; the present land
use at the site; the proposed use and, for subdivisions, the proposed number of
lots and average proposed lot size; the body (commission or council) that will
conduct the hearing; the date, time, and place of the hearing; a statement of
the availability of application materials for public review, and a statement

ARTICLE B. APPEALS AND VARIANCES
SECTION:
17.16B.010: Appeals
17.16B.020: Variances
17.16B.010: APPEALS:
Any decision of the administrator or commission may be appealed using the
procedure described herein. A notice of appeal must be filed within ten (10)
days after the administrator's notice of the decision being appealed. Appeals
from decisions of the administrator are heard by the commission. Appeals from
decisions of the commission are heard by the council.
   A.   The appellant shall file a properly completed notice of appeal, the
required supporting materials, and the required appeal fee with the
administrator. If a notice of appeal alleges that the decision of the
administrator or commission constitutes a taking of property without just
compensation, the administrator shall direct the appeal to the city attorney.
   B.   The city attorney shall review the allegation that a decision of the
administrator or commission constitutes a taking of property without just
compensation. This review shall be based on the Idaho attorney general's
checklist provided herein and other information the city attorney deems
relevant, including the property rights policy of the plan.
      1.   Idaho Attorney General's Takings Checklist Criteria: Agency staff
must use the following questions in reviewing the potential impact of a
regulatory or administrative action on specific property. While these questions
also provide a framework for evaluating the impact proposed regulations may
have generally, takings questions normally arise in the context of specific
affected property. The public review process used for evaluating proposed
regulations is another tool that the agency should use aggressively to
safeguard rights of private property owners. If property is subject to
regulatory jurisdiction of multiple government agencies, each agency should be
sensitive to the cumulative impacts of the various regulatory restrictions.
Although a question may be answered affirmatively, it does not mean that there
has been a "taking". Rather, it means there could be a constitutional issue and
that agency staff should carefully review the proposed action with legal
counsel.
         a.   Does the regulation or action result in a permanent or temporary
physical occupation of private property?
Regulation or action resulting in a permanent or temporary physical occupation
of all or a portion of private property will generally constitute a "taking".
For example, a regulation that required landlords to allow the installation of
cable television boxes in their apartments was found to constitute a "taking".
See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).
         b.   Does the regulation or action require a property owner to
dedicate a portion of property or to grant an easement?
Carefully review all regulations requiring the dedication of property or grant
of an easement. The dedication of property must be reasonably and specifically
designed to prevent or compensate for adverse impacts of the proposed
development. Likewise the magnitude of the burden placed on the proposed
development should be reasonably related to the adverse impacts created by the
development. A court will also consider whether the action in question
substantially advances a legitimate state interest.
For example, the United States supreme court determined in Nollan v. California
Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), that compelling an owner of waterfront
property to grant a public easement across his property that does not
substantially advance the public's interest in beach access constitutes a
"taking". Likewise, the United States supreme court held that compelling a
property owner to leave a public greenway, as opposed to a private one, did not
substantially advance protection of a floodplain, and was a "taking". Dolan v.
City Of Tigard, 114 U.S. 2309 (June 24, 1994).
         c.   Does the regulation deprive the owner of all economically viable
uses of the property?
If a regulation prohibits all economically viable or beneficial uses of the
land, it will likely constitute a "taking". In this situation, the agency can
avoid liability for just compensation only if it can demonstrate that the
proposed uses are prohibited by the laws of nuisance or other preexisting
limitations on the use of the property. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Coun., 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992).
Unlike subsections B1a and B1b of this section, it is important to analyze the
regulation's impact on the property as a whole, and not just the impact on a
portion of the property. It is also important to assess whether there is any
profitable use of the remaining property available. See Florida Rock
Industries, Inc. v. United States, 18 F.3d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The remaining
use does not necessarily have to be the owner's planned use, a prior use or the
highest and best use of the property. One factor in this assessment is the
degree to which the regulatory action interferes with a property owner's
reasonable investment backed development expectations.
Carefully review regulations requiring that all of a particular parcel of land
be left substantially in its natural state. A prohibition of all economically
viable uses of the property is vulnerable to a takings challenge. In some
situations, however, there may be preexisting limitations on the use of
property that could insulate the government from takings liability.
         d.   Does the regulation have a significant impact on the landowner's
economic interest?
Carefully review regulations that have a significant impact on the owner's
economic interest. Courts will often compare the value of the property before
and after the impact of the challenged regulation. Although a reduction in
property value alone may be a "taking", a severe reduction in property value
often indicates a reduction or elimination of reasonably profitable uses.
Another economic factor courts will consider is the degree to which the
challenged regulation impacts acts any development rights of the owner. As with
subsection B1c of this section, these economic factors are normally applied to
the property as a whole.
         e.   Does the regulation deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?
Regulations that deny the landowner a fundamental attribute of ownership -
including the right to possess, exclude others and dispose of all or a portion
of the property - are potential takings.
The United States supreme court recently held that requiring a public easement
for recreational purposes where the harm to be prevented was to the floodplain
was a "taking". In finding this to be a "taking", the court stated:
The city never demonstrated why a public greenway, as opposed to a private one,
was required in the interest of flood control. The difference to the
petitioner, of course, is the loss of her ability to exclude others... [T]his
right to exclude others is "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of
rights that are commonly characterized as property".
Dolan v. City Of Tigard, 114 U.S. 2309 (June 24, 1994). The United States
supreme court has also held that barring the inheritance (an essential
attribute of ownership) of certain interests in land held by individual members
of an Indian tribe constituted a "taking". Hodel v. Irvin, 481 U.S. 704 (1987).
         f.   Does the regulation serve the same purpose that would be served
by directly prohibiting the use of action, and does the condition imposed
substantially advance that purpose?
A regulation may go too far and may result in a takings claim where it does not
substantially advance a legitimate governmental purpose. Nollan v. California
Coastal Commission, 107 S. Ct. 3141 (1987); Dolan v. City Of Tigard, 114 U.S.
2309 (June 24, 1994).
In Nollan, the United States supreme court held that it was an unconstitutional
"taking" to condition the issuance of a permit to landowners on the grant of an
easement to the public to use their beach. The court found that since there was
no indication that the Nollans' house plans interfered in any way with the
public's ability to walk up and down the beach, there was no "nexus" between
any public interest that might be harmed by the construction of the house, and
the permit conditions. Lacking this connection, the required easement was just
as unconstitutional as it would be if imposed outside the permit context.
Likewise regulatory actions that closely resemble, or have the effects of a
physical invasion or occupation of property, are more likely to be found to be
takings. The greater the deprivation of use, the greater the likelihood that a
"taking" will be found.
   C.   The administrator shall place a hearing on the appeal on the agenda of
the next regular commission or council meeting for which the attorney's review
(if relevant) and notice requirements can be met, and at which time will permit
its proper consideration. Notice requirements for an appeal shall be the same
as for the original permit application.
   D.   The commission or council shall conduct a hearing on the appeal
following the procedure established in section
17.16C.010 of this chapter. No appeal shall be heard if the appellant or a
representative and, when the appellant is not the developer, the developer or a
representative is not present.
   E.   The commission or council shall determine whether the decision being
appealed is in compliance with the comprehensive plan and this title, and
affirm, modify, or overturn that decision accordingly. Where a taking of
property without just compensation is alleged, the commission or council shall
also consider the city attorney's review of the decision, as provided by
subsection B of this section.
   F.   The administrator shall notify the appellant and interested parties of
the commission's or council's decision within ten (10) days. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.16B.020: VARIANCES:
Variances are intended to provide relief for landowners who, due to some unique
physical characteristic of their property that is beyond their control, would
have no beneficial use of the property if this title is strictly enforced.
Applications for variances shall follow the procedure described herein.
Applications for variances may be combined and processed simultaneously with
applications for class II permits.
   A.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form, the
required supporting materials, and the required application fee with the
administrator.
   B.   The administrator shall place a hearing on the variance on the agenda
of the next regular commission meeting for which the notice requirements can be
met and at which time will allow its proper consideration. Notice requirements
for a variance shall be the same as for a class II permit, and class II permit
and variance hearings may be combined when appropriate. When such a combination
is made, the hearing notice shall specifically describe the proposed variance,
including a citation of the sections of this title from which a variance is
requested.
   C.   The commission shall conduct a hearing on the proposed variance
following the procedure established in section
17.16C.010 of this chapter. No application for a variance shall be reviewed if
the developer or a representative is not present.
   D.   The commission shall approve a variance only upon finding that:
      1.   The need for a variance results from physical limitations unique to
the lot or parcel on which the variance is requested;
      2.   Failure to approve the variance will result in undue hardship
because no reasonable conforming use of the lot or parcel is possible without a
variance;
      3.   The alleged hardship has not been created by action of the owner or
occupants;
      4.   Approval of the variance will not create a nuisance, result in
potential harm to adjoining properties or the neighborhood, or have an adverse
effect on the implementation of the comprehensive plan; and
      5.   The variance approved is the minimum relief from the requirements of
this title necessary to permit a reasonable conforming use.
      6.   Conditions may be attached to the approval of any variance, as
provided in section
17.16A.090 of this chapter.
   E.   The administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties of
the commission's decision within ten (10) days.
   F.   The commission's decision may be appealed to the council using the
appeals procedure of section
17.16B.010 of this article. A notice of any such appeal shall be filed with the
administrator within ten (10) days after notice of the decision has been
issued. Developers proceed at their own risk during this appeal period. (Ord.

conditional use permit application; the commission may approve, conditionally
approve, modify or deny a conditional use permit under the conditions as herein
specified and considering such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent
of this article. The Council may also hold a public hearing if it is deemed
necessary to collect information and/or make clarifications on the application.
   C.   Interpretation Of Conditional Use: Any use which is permitted as a
conditional use in a district under the terms of this article shall not be
deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall, without further action,

uses;
   G.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   H.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   I.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,

concerning the land proposed to be acquired. Within thirty (30) days of the
date of notice, the public agency may request the Governing Body to suspend
consideration on the permit for sixty (60) days from the date of the request;
however, if an agreement is not reached within sixty (60) days, the commission
shall resume consideration of the conditional use application.

hold a public hearing on each conditional use permit application as specified
in section

The applicant or any person who appeared in person or in writing before the
commission may appeal the decision of the commission to the Council, provided
the appeal is submitted to the Council fifteen (15) days prior to the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting.
   D.   Conditions Of Permit: Upon the granting of a conditional use permit,
conditions may be attached to said permit including, but not limited to, those:
      1.   Minimizing adverse impact on other development (such as: buffering,
screening, access locations, etc.);
      2.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development;
      3.   Controlling the duration of development;
      4.   Assuring that development is maintained properly;
      5.   Designating the exact location and nature of development (such as:
aesthetics, facade design, green space requirements, building height and
building footprint size);
      6.   Requiring the provision for on site or off site public facilities or
services;
      7.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required
in this title; and
      8.   Bonds.
   E.   Transfer And Modifications Of Permit:
      1.   A conditional use permit is not transferable from one parcel of land
to another. Conditional use permits are an entitlement to the specific property
on which the approval was granted and upon any transfer of title for the
property the conditional use permit transfers to the new owner(s) without
further application or approval, provided, however, the new owner(s) shall be
bound by the same conditions of approval applicable to the conditional use
permit that was transferred. The new owner(s) shall provide written
acknowledgement to the City accepting the terms of the transferred conditional
use permit within sixty (60) days of purchase and receipt by the new owners of
actual notice of the existence of the conditional use permit for the parcel,
whichever event occurs later; otherwise, the permit may be declared void after
notice and public hearing before the City Council.
      2.   The Administrator may approve or deny specified minor modifications
by applicant, provided such modifications were not the subject of review during
the original public hearing and will not adversely impact adjacent properties.
Such minor modifications include, but are not limited to, the following:
         a.   A reduction in density not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the
total units.
         b.   Minor relocation of dwelling units or building pads for practical
reasons such as road alignment, topography or access.
         c.   Minor changes to the recreation area or open space design, but
not elimination or reduction in area.
         d.   Increase in building square footage, not exceeding ten percent
(10%), provided that the parking and landscaping requirements are met.
      3.   All other modifications shall be considered by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and/or City Council at a public hearing. The commission/
Council may modify the conditions, limitations and/or scope of the permit, in
accord with the limitations and requirements of this chapter.
   F.   Effect Of Issuance On Other Conditional Uses: A conditional use permit
shall not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other
conditional use permits.
   G.   Time Limitations, Extensions:
      1.   Once a conditional use is approved and exercised, said use may
continue without further temporal constraints, provided that the use complies
with its intended purpose, or City approved modifications thereafter, and does
not violate any codes, subject to the following:
         a.   An approved conditional use permit shall be valid for a term
approved and conditioned by the City Council.
         b.   An extension of the time limit for an approved conditional use
may be granted by the Administrator without further notice and hearing, if the
following findings are made:
            (1)   There are no outstanding City Code or conditional use permit
violations on the subject property. If such violations exist, they may be
conditioned by the City Council to be cured as a condition of the extension of
time;
            (2)   The conditional use, as previously approved, remains in the
best interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the City;
            (3)   There have been no significant changes to this Code between
the date of conditional use approval and the date of the time extension request
that would require substantial modifications to the project;
            (4)   There are no hazardous conditions which have developed or
have been discovered on the project site; and
            (5)   The public facilities and services required for the project
remain adequate. (Ord. 471-18, 2018)

17.24.050: Performance Standards
17.24.010: PURPOSE:
The lower density residential zoning district (LDRZD) protects neighborhoods of
one- and two-family dwellings from the conflicts that arise where residential
uses are mixed with higher density residential developments and commercial or
industrial enterprises. Home businesses are permitted, but only in compliance
with performance standards that require them to be compatible with neighboring
homes. Schools, churches, daycare centers, and parks are also allowed, but only
after public review and approval of a class II permit ensures that they are
compatible with a predominantly residential environment. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

Notes:
   1.   Minimum lot size will be a function of the requirements of this title
relative to the size and type of use, including the minimum setbacks and
maximum lot coverage, off street parking and loading requirements, and
landscaped buffer requirements.
   2.   Minimum front setback will be a function of the required landscaped
buffers (which include a planting strip for HCZD uses along U.S. Highway 20)
and other site planning considerations.
   3.   There is no minimum side or rear setback within the IZD, nor is there a
maximum lot coverage, but landscaped buffers may be required where the IZD
adjoins other zoning districts.
   4.   No set limit, but the fire department must provide a statement of
record that it can adequately protect structures over 35 feet in height.
   5.   Buildings with overnight residential usage must provide off-street
parking in accordance with
Chapter 17.60 of this title. Lodging places (SLUC 15) = 1 per unit, plus 1;
Dwellings (SLUC 11, 14) 2 per unit.
   Exception: Where a uniform (maximum 2 foot variation among buildings)
setback that is less than the requirement of this table has been established by
at least 60 percent of the existing buildings on a block facing a local street
(this exception does not apply along U.S. Highway 20 or Idaho State Highway
47), new buildings may come to that line.
   B.   Definitions of the principal terms used in this table are provided
below. Every lot has one front, one rear, and two (2) side yards.
BUILDING       Measured from average finished grade to the highest part of the

Note:
   1.   Buffers shall not be required for redevelopment of existing IZD uses.
   B.   Minimum Buffer Requirements: The width of required buffers varies with
the nature of the uses being separated, as shown in subsection A of this
section. The minimum buffer width given in the table is the width required
where the buffer consists of a level or gently sloping area of sod or ground
cover and at least four (4) major trees per hundred linear feet of buffer. It
is suggested to avoid black cottonwood, willows, and quaking aspen due to
problems with sewer and water lines. (See landscape section.)
   C.   Buffer Width Reduction; Berms Or Walls: The minimum buffer width
requirements may be reduced where a berm is included in the buffer or where an
opaque fence or wall is installed along the interior edge of the buffer. The
width reduction shall be twice the height of a berm or the height of a fence or
wall, but the maximum permitted reduction shall be thirty percent (30%) of the
minimum required buffer width. No berm shall have a slope of more than three to
one (3:1), except where a retaining wall is incorporated into the berm on the
side opposite the use or public way being buffered. Fences or walls shall be
consistent in design and the choice of materials and color with the principal
building being buffered.
   D.   Buffer Width Reduction; More Plants: The basic buffer width
requirements may be reduced where a greater density and diversity of plantings
is included in the buffer. The buffer width reductions permitted for different
types of additional plantings are cumulative and may result in a total
reduction of up to thirty percent (30%). The buffer width reduction permitted
for a berm or wall is cumulative with those permitted herein permitting a
maximum total sixty percent (60%) reduction in the width of the buffer.
      1.   Major Trees: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten
percent (10%) where five (5) or more major trees per hundred linear feet are
planted or retained.
      2.   Understory Trees: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten
percent (10%) where five (5) or more understory trees per hundred linear feet
are planted or retained.
      3.   Shrubs: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten percent
(10%) where twenty (20) or more shrubs per hundred linear feet are planted or
retained.
   E.   Minimum Buffer Width; Regardless Of Reductions: No required buffer
shall be less than half the minimum required buffer width or less than eight
feet (8') wide, regardless of any reductions permitted.
   F.   Buffer Crossings; Inclusions: Buffers may be crossed by access
driveways, utility lines, sidewalks, and pedestrian trails. A sidewalk or
pedestrian trail may also run along the length of a buffer, with its width, up
to a maximum five feet (5'), being included in the required buffer width.
Buffers may also include permitted signs.
   G.   Plant Materials Specifications: Plant materials installed in required
buffers shall be warrantied for one year and meet the following specifications:
1) all trees, major and understory, shall be containerized or bagged and
burlapped stock in good condition with a caliper of at least 1.5 inches,
measured one foot (1') above grade, for deciduous trees, and a height of at
least six feet (6') for coniferous trees; and 2) all shrubs shall be minimum
one gallon containerized stock in good condition.
   H.   Maintenance: Perpetual maintenance of required buffers is required by
sections
17.68.120 through
17.68.150 of this title.

   B.   The public facilities needs of the large scale development shall be
determined through a fact finding process conducted by the commission, at the
expense of the developer. The commission may retain planners and/or engineers
to conduct this study, the purpose of which shall be to determine what new
facilities needs may be attributed to the proposed development. The large scale
development study process shall be conducted as follows:
      1.   The administrator shall determine whether a proposed development is
a large scale development upon the filing of an application for sketch plan
review.
      2.   The administrator shall place the initiation of a large scale
development study on the agenda of the next regular commission meeting, along
with the sketch plan review.
      3.   The commission shall review the application at that meeting. If it
confirms the administrator's determination, the commission shall direct the
administrator to begin a large scale development study.
      4.   Where a large scale development study is required, the developer
shall place a deposit with the city in the amount provided in the resolution
establishing fees for administration of this title. The administrator shall
retain appropriate professional assistance for the study, drawing against the
required deposit as necessary. All unused funds shall be returned to the
developer upon completion of the study.
      5.   The application shall be considered complete and a hearing scheduled
only after completion of the large scale development study.
   C.   A large scale development study shall:
      1.   Project the additional need for public facilities that will be
generated by the proposed development;
      2.   Inventory the facilities that will serve the proposed development
and their existing condition and capacity;
      3.   Combine the projections and inventory to show what, if any,
additional or improved facilities will be needed to serve the proposed
development; and
      4.   Estimate the costs of those additional or improved facilities. Where
it is anticipated that new or improved facilities will also serve other
developments (existing or new), the study shall calculate the fair proportional
contribution of the large scale development to the total costs of the new or
improved facilities. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

I permits for new agricultural storage facilities shall include an on site
circulation plan showing how trucks will flow through the site and
demonstrating that potentially adverse impacts on public roads will be
minimized. Where storage facilities are part of a commercial or industrial
development, the circulation plan must be submitted with the application for
class II permit review.
   B.   Commercial And Industrial Uses: All commercial and industrial buildings
and uses, except those to which subsection A of this section applies, shall
provide one safe, properly signed, off street loading area for each ten
thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area. Off street loading areas
shall: 1) be on the same lot and under the same ownership as the building or
use they serve, 2) be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle that may
reasonably be anticipated for use on the site, and 3) have the following
minimum dimensions:
 
Vertical clearance 14 feet
Width              12 feet
Depth (length)     35 feet
 
No vehicle parked in a required off street loading space shall extend into a
public right of way. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

Paved access driveways shall be provided for safe access to all off street
parking and loading areas.
   A.   No parking area, except those serving single-family dwellings, shall be
designed or constructed to create a situation in which vehicles are required to
back onto a public road.
   B.   Parking and loading areas shall be sited and designed to minimize the
number of access points to arterial roads.
   C.   No access driveway to a local road shall be within twenty feet (20') of
any intersection or alley or ten feet (10') of another access point. The
distance from an access driveway to an intersection is measured from the
junction of the corner lot lines at the intersection, to the nearest side of
the driveway.
   D.   No access driveway to an arterial road shall be within sixty feet (60')
of its intersection with any local street, or two hundred feet (200') of its
intersection with another arterial.
   E.   Clear vision triangles shall be provided for all access driveways, as
described in section
17.56A.050 of this title.
   F.   Access driveways for single-family dwellings shall be a minimum of ten

a minimum twelve inch (12") culvert capable of supporting a load of forty
thousand (40,000) pounds. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.60.090: CIRCULATION WITHIN OFF STREET PARKING AREAS:
The pattern of circulation within parking areas shall be designed to provide
safe and efficient access to individual parking spaces, protect pedestrians
moving through the parking area and prevent accidents by minimizing the random
movement of automobiles, and facilitate safe access to public streets.
   A.   Minimum aisle widths shall be:
      1.   For two-way circulation and/or ninety degree (90°) parking: Twenty
four feet (24');
      2.   For one-way circulation and sixty degree (60°) angle parking:
Eighteen feet (18');
      3.   For one-way circulation and forty five degree (45°) angle parking:
Fifteen feet (15'); and
      4.   For one-way circulation and thirty degree (30°) angle parking:
Thirteen feet (13').
   B.   Where one-way circulation is used, directional signs shall be installed
at all access points to the parking area.
   C.   No parking area shall be designed so that circulation from one portion
of the area to another relies on a public street. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)

pursuant to formal development agreements, and requires the perpetual
maintenance of required improvements. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.020: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS DEFINED:
A "required improvement" is any improvement required for compliance with this
title. Required improvements specifically include (but are not limited to): a)
any runoff and erosion control measures, including plantings, required in an
approved runoff and erosion control plan; b) any open space or recreational
area or facilities required of a large scale development; c) landscaped buffers
and any other improvements required to mitigate a nuisance; d) water, sewer,
and other utilities, including any extension of lines required to serve the
development; e) off street parking and loading areas; and f) streets, including
bridges, culverts, and street identification and traffic control signs. (Ord.
459-13, 2013)
17.68.030: INSTALLATION AT DEVELOPER'S EXPENSE:
The installation of all required improvements shall be at the developer's
expense. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.040: STANDARDS FOR REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
All required improvements shall be installed in compliance with this title and
any design and engineering standards separately adopted by the city or other
agencies responsible for providing services to the development. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.68.050: TIME OF INSTALLATION; DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Developers may install all required improvements before a final plat is
recorded or the development is offered for lease or sale, leased, sold, or
occupied.
   B.   Developers may elect to record final plats of the development in phases
and/or offer phases of the development for lease, sale, or occupancy before all
required improvements are installed. Phasing shall be permitted pursuant to a
development agreement that:
      1.   Incorporates a conceptual site plan of the entire development (the
site plan used as a basis for permit approval) and a detailed site plan and
construction drawings of the initial phase(s);
      2.   Identifies all required improvements in the initial phase(s) and
establishes their estimated cost;
      3.   Sets a schedule for the completion of the required improvements in
the initial phase(s) and an anticipated schedule for future phases;
      4.   Guarantees completion, repair, and one year's maintenance of all
required improvements in the initial phase(s) using one of the methods listed
in section
17.68.070 of this chapter and provides a process for the submission of detailed
plans, cost estimates, and the guarantee of improvements in future phases;
      5.   Provides a process by which the city may, if necessary, complete
required improvements using the guarantee(s) provided;
      6.   Provides a process by which either party may request renegotiation
of the development agreement;
      7.   Provides a process by which the development agreement may be
transferred, with city approval, to the developer's successors; and
      8.   Provides that the development agreement and any vested rights it
confers shall be void if the city is required to "call" a guarantee to complete
required improvements or if the anticipated schedule required by subsection B3
of this section is not met or renegotiated. The developer shall have the right
to renegotiate the anticipated schedule without losing vested rights, provided
that such negotiations are initiated, by the developer, within ninety (90) days
after failure to initiate or complete a phase as scheduled.
      9.   An "initial" phase is any phase anticipated to begin within eighteen
(18) months. The anticipated schedule may set times for the initiation or
completion of a phase in terms of reasonable ranges of twelve (12) months:
i.e., phase I will be completed between June 1992 and June 1993.
      10.   All development will be contiguous with the city. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.68.060: EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
The effect of a development agreement shall be to create vested rights in the
conceptual site plan, as it was approved. All such rights expire with the
development agreement. Development agreements do not insulate developments from
changes in state or federal regulations or changes in building and fire codes.
(Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.070: GUARANTEES:
Completion of the improvements identified in a development agreement shall be
guaranteed by one of the following methods:
   A.   The developer may place an amount equal to one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the estimated cost in escrow, with that amount and accumulated
interest being released only after the city has inspected and accepted the
required improvements. A development agreement may provide for the phased
release of a portion of the escrowed funds as work proceeds, but at least
twenty five percent (25%) of the amount in escrow shall be retained until all
required improvements are installed, inspected, and accepted. If any required
improvements are not completed as provided in the development agreement, the
city shall use as much as necessary of the escrow account to complete those
improvements, before returning any remaining balance to the developer.
   B.   The developer may provide an irrevocable or standing letter of credit
for an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost.
The letter of credit shall be released only after the city has inspected and
accepted the required improvements. If any required improvements are not
completed as provided in the development agreement, the city shall use as much
as necessary of the credit available to complete those improvements. (Ord. 459-
13, 2013)
17.68.080: INSPECTION FEES:
Fees for the inspection of required improvements shall be set by resolution of
the city commissioners. Inspection fees shall be paid before any work on
required improvements is permitted. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.090: INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Required improvements shall be inspected by the administrator before
acceptance. Acceptance of required improvements shall be by action of the
council, following submission of the developer's written request for acceptance
and receipt of the administrator's report that all improvements have been
inspected and are in compliance with these regulations. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.100: AS BUILT DRAWINGS:
Reproducible as built drawings of all subdivision improvements shall be
provided to the city at the developer's expense. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.110: WARRANTY OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Required improvements shall be warranted by the developer for both materials
and workmanship for one year after their acceptance. Such a warranty provision
shall be included in all development agreements. Where all required
improvements will be completed before a final plat is approved and the
development is offered for lease, sale, or occupancy, a warranty agreement
shall be submitted for approval. Enforcement of the warranty shall be assured
by:
   A.   Retention of ten percent (10%) of an escrow account established to
comply with section
17.68.070 of this chapter;
   B.   A continuing letter of credit, as provided in section
17.68.070 of this chapter, but for ten percent (10%) of the cost of the
required improvements; or
   C.   Establishment of a new escrow account, in which an amount equal to ten
percent (10%) of the cost of all required improvements is deposited, and which
shall be released only upon expiration of the warranty. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.120: CONTINUING MAINTENANCE REQUIRED:
The continuing maintenance of any improvement required for compliance with
these regulations shall be required. Failure to maintain any required
improvement shall be a violation of these regulations. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.68.130: MAINTENANCE MECHANISM:
Any development subject to the continuing maintenance requirement of section
17.68.120 of this chapter that results, or may reasonably be expected to
result, in the creation of multiple ownerships (subdivisions, condominiums)
shall create a community association or similar mechanism to assure continuing
maintenance. The developer shall submit the proposed declaration of covenants,
articles of incorporation, and bylaws for the community association with the
application for a permit and these documents shall be approved by the city
attorney and recorded before any certificate of compliance is issued.
Exception: Creation of a community association shall not be required where the
only improvement provided is future access to adjoining parcels. (Ord. 459-13,
2013)
17.68.140: OPEN SPACE MAINTENANCE:
The maintenance of any open space area required for compliance with these
regulations shall include fencing, where required; control of noxious weeds;
litter removal; and wildfire suppression. Maintenance activities shall not
diminish the open space values (wetlands, slopes, etc.) being protected. (Ord.
459-13, 2013)

vectors of disease, including insects and rodents. The required mitigation for
a health hazard can be removal or enclosure in an appropriate container or
structure. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.72.040: MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES:
   A.   All premises shall be maintained free of litter and weeds that might
pose a health or safety hazard or result in the spread of weeds to other
properties. Failure to so maintain any lot or parcel shall be a violation of
this title.
   B.   All vacant lands shall be maintained in turf or an equivalent
vegetative cover that prevents water and wind erosion. Failure to so maintain
any lot or parcel shall be a violation of this title. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
17.72.050: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES:
The procedure of section
17.16D.040 of this title should be used to determine whether a violation of
this chapter exists.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1261.gif]

IMAGES/0-0-0-1265.gif]
      3.   Backed (Double Faced) Signs: When two (2) sign faces supported by
the same sign structure are placed back to back, or the distance between each
sign face does not exceed two feet (2') at any point, the signs shall be
regarded as a single sign. The sign area shall be the area of the larger sign.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1263.gif]
      4.   Multiple Cabinets: For freestanding and projecting signs that
contain multiple cabinets on one structure, the modules together are counted as
one sign face in order to compute the sign area.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1267.gif]
      5.   Round Or Three-Dimensional Signs: Where a sign consists of one or
more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters or objects,
sculpture, or statuelike trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their
maximum height times maximum width.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c5067d54157e555abedb47d3b627ac507a8b9ba3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1269.gif]
      6.   Individual Sign Elements: When signs are constructed of individual
elements, the area of all sign elements, which together convey a single,
complete message, shall be considered as a single sign. The sign area is
determined by calculating the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the
sign elements. Sign elements will be measured as one unit when the distance
between the elements is less than two (2) times the dimension of each element.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1271.gif]
      7.   Supporting Framework: Supporting framework or bracing on sign
mounted to the building that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall
not be computed as sign area.
      8.   Signs On Awnings And Canopies: When signs are incorporated into the
awning, or canopy, the sign area is determined by computing the area of an
imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign copy including all translucent areas
of an illuminated awning or canopy.

   B.   Clearances: Clearances are measured from the finished grade directly
below the sign to the bottom of the sign structure.
   C.   Corner Signs: Diagonal corner signs that face more than one street must
be assigned to a street frontage by the applicant. The sign must meet all
standards for the street frontage it is assigned to. (Ord. 459-13, 2013)
