is the further intent of the Twin Falls city council that this chapter be

the international fire code as adopted would result in unnecessary hardship.

fire code as adopted would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other properties under the terms of the international fire code as adopted.
         (c)   Granting the modification requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the international fire code
as adopted to other lands, structures or buildings.
A modification shall not be granted unless the city council makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it
which support conclusions that the above-mentioned standards and conditions
have been met by the applicant.
   (D)   Modifications Limited: A resolution of the city council modifying the
requirements of the international fire code as adopted is not and shall not be

in determining age.

immediately notify the parent or guardian. The juvenile and/or parents or
guardian shall then be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment,
under constitutional safeguards of relevant facts, and to centralize
responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making

attend class instructions on parenting provided through the County Juvenile
Probation Office. The purpose of the instruction is to provide the parents with
more ideas and support in raising their children.
   (C)   Misdemeanor: Upon a first offense of any of the provisions of this
Chapter by the juvenile or parent, the prosecuting attorney may request a
preliminary inquiry from the Department of Juvenile Probation for screening and

shall become collectable as a special assessment with property taxes.
      4.   That the property owner has a right to appear before the city
council to show cause as to why he or she should not be forced to abate or pay
for abatement of the nuisance; furthermore, that if the property owner desires
such a hearing, a request for hearing, in writing, shall be given to the
designated enforcement officer prior to expiration of the ten (10) day notice,
and that abatement by the city will proceed if the property owner has not
exercised this option to request a hearing.
      5.   If said certified notice is returned as undeliverable, or is
unclaimed by the property owner, nothing shall preclude the city from
exercising its abatement option as specified herein.
   (B)   When the ten (10) day notice has expired without a request for
hearing, the mayor's designated enforcement officer is authorized to remove,
abate or destroy the nuisance. The designated enforcement officer is authorized
to utilize city personnel to abate the nuisance or to contact the mayor or
chief of police in regard to contracting for an outside party to abate the
nuisance.

a statement of charges billed to the property owner may be mailed or personally
delivered to the property owner.
   (D)   If payment is not received from the property owner within thirty (30)
days, the amount billed shall, in accordance with state law, be assessed as a
special assessment collectable against the subject property as other state,
county and municipal taxes.

council, the hearing shall, if feasible, be placed on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled city council meeting. The decision of the city council
shall be final. A ten (10) day period shall be given the property owner after

FINANCING SEWER SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION
SECTION:

7-6-3-1: Construction Financing
7-6-3-2: Dedication and Use
7-6-3-3: City Fund Participation
7-6-1: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER: An owner whose property is contiguous to a public
right of way or easement that contains a public sewer.
PRIVATELY FUNDED SEWER: Public sewers that were financed by and are of primary
benefit to a small group of adjacent property owners.
PUBLICLY FUNDED SEWERS: Public sewers that were financed wholly or in part by
the general users of the City waste water system with no financial contribution
by the adjacent property owners at the time of construction and that are of
primary benefit to a large group of general users.
PROPERTY DEPTH: A distance measured perpendicular to the center line of a
publicly funded sewer between the property line which is nearest to and the
property line farthest from the center line of a publicly funded sewer.
Whenever the property lines are not exactly parallel to the sewer center line,
the average distance shall be used or such other distance that most nearly
satisfies the intent of this Chapter.
7-6-2: SEWERS CONSTRUCTED BY PUBLIC FUNDS:
7-6-2-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Section is to provide for the collection of an assessment
for sewer connection, which assessment shall be used by the City Waste Water
Department to participate in the construction of privately funded sewers. The
assessment for connection to a publicly funded sewer shall be equivalent to the
average cost a property owner would pay as his share of group project to
construct a privately funded sewer. The participation in the construction of
privately funded sewers shall be equivalent to the cost a property owner would
pay as his share of a group project to construct a privately funded sewer. The
participation is to be paid when such a property owner is not participating in
the group project by virtue of the fact that he has been allowed to connect to
a publicly funded sewer and is therefor increasing the financial burden of the
group of property owners who are not adjacent to the publicly funded sewer.
7-6-2-2: CONNECTION ALLOWED:
Whenever a property owner's property is contiguous for a distance of at least
fifty feet (50') to the right of way or easement containing a publicly funded
sewer, he shall be allowed to connect a building on such property to the
publicly funded sewer, subject to the provisions contained herein, providing
each building so connected is on a separate building lot conforming to the
provisions of the City zoning regulations 1  and providing neither the service
connection nor the building sewer exceeds fifty feet (50') in length. Such
connections shall, in addition to the provisions contained herein, be subject
to all regulations, charges and fees established by the City sewer system
regulations. 2  (Ord. 1783, 9-7-76)
 
Notes
1 1. See Title 10 of this Code
2 2. See Chapter 7 of this Code
7-6-2-3: CONNECTION ASSESSMENT:
   (A)   Whenever a property owner connects directly to a publicly funded sewer
he shall agree to pay a connection assessment, plus a system development fee.
The assessment and fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. 1783, 9-7-76; amd. 1980)
   (B)   The assessment referred to shall represent the average cost a property
owner would pay as his share of a group project to construct a privately funded
sewer and shall be adequate to reimburse the Waste Water Department for its
average participation in a group project as provided for herein. The assessment
shall be a fixed cost for properties of average depth. The average depth shall
be considered to be one hundred feet (100').
   (C)   All connection assessments paid shall be receipted to the Waste Water
Revenue Fund as a general user charge and transferred into the Waste Water
Improvement Fund Collection Division to be expended as a capital improvement.
7-6-2-4: PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS:
   (A)   Prior to connection to a publicly funded sewer, the property owner
shall either pay the sewer connection assessment in full or enter into an
agreement with the City to pay the assessment plus interest in two hundred
forty (240) equal monthly payments. The rate of interest shall be established
by resolution of the City Council.
   (B)   The interest rate so established shall be equivalent to the average
interest rate paid on local improvement district bonds. The agreement shall
provide for early debt retirement without penalty and for termination of sewer
service for nonpayment of the monthly payments when due.
7-6-2-5: AUTHORITY OF CITY ENGINEER:
The City Engineer shall have the authority to determine the amount of
connection assessments due and to determine the amount of financial
participation in sewer projects. This determination shall be based on the
intent of this Section. All such determinations shall be subject to review by
the City Council. (Ord. 1783, 9-7-76)
7-6-3: PRIVATELY FUNDED SEWER SYSTEMS:
7-6-3-1: CONSTRUCTION FINANCING:
Whenever property owners within the City desire to construct a privately funded
sewer system to serve the territory within which they live, the following
methods of construction financing are suggested:
   (A)   Local improvement districts in conformance with State law. 1
   (B)   Private finance agreements among the property owners concerned.
 
Notes
1 1. I.C. 50-1701 et seq.
7-6-3-2: DEDICATION AND USE:
Whenever the privately funded sewer is to be connected to the City waste water
system, said privately funded sewer shall be dedicated to the public for public
use and the same shall be maintained and operated by the City Waste Water
Department for the benefit of the public at large.
7-6-3-3: CITY FUND PARTICIPATION:
   (A)   The Waste Water Department is authorized to participate financially in
the construction of a privately funded sewer whenever (1) an adjacent property
owner is not participating in the private sewer project because he was allowed
to connect to a publicly funded sewer, and (2) the nonparticipation of the
adjacent property owner will increase the financial burden to those persons
participating.
   (B)   The Waste Water Department's financial participation shall be equal to
what the nonparticipating owner's share will be; provided, however, that in
calculating the share of the nonparticipating owner, the property depth used in
the calculation shall not exceed one hundred twenty five feet (125').
   (C)   Funds for participation by the Waste Water Department shall be derived
by a connection assessment, which assessment shall be paid by persons
connecting to publicly funded sewers. Said assessment is provided for in
Chapter 7 of this Title. (Ord. 1784, 9-7-76; amd. Ord., 2-7-77)

7-7-1-1: PURPOSE AND POLICY (EPA 1.1):
(Hereafter, "EPA" is the comparable EPA Model Pretreatment Ordinance
reference).
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned
treatment works (POTW) for the City of Twin Falls and enables the City to
comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water
Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part
403). The objectives of this ordinance are:
   (A)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
   (B)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise
be incompatible with the POTW;
   (C)   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with

the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   (B)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection (A)2 or (A)3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or
adds to existing process or production equipment.
   (C)   Construction of a new source as defined under this definition has
commenced if the owner or operator has:
      1.   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site

excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which
is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source
facilities or equipment; or
      2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering,
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
definition.
NEW USER: A user that is not regulated under federal categorical pretreatment
standards but that applies to the city for a new building permit or occupies an
existing building and plans to commence discharge of wastewater to the city's
collection system after the effective date of this chapter. Any person that
buys an existing facility that is discharging nondomestic wastewater will be
considered an "existing user" if no significant changes are made in the
manufacturing operation.
PASS-THROUGH: A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United States
in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge
or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement
of the city's NPDES permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration
of a violation).
PERMITTEE: A user issued an industrial wastewater discharge permit.

demand [COD], toxicity, or odor).
PRETREATMENT: The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to (or in lieu of) introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical, or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means (except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard) (cf. 40 CFR 403.3(a)).

pretreatment imposed on a user, other than a national pretreatment standard
(cf. 40 CFR 403.3(t)).
PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS OR PROHIBITED DISCHARGES: Absolute prohibitions
against the discharge of certain substances, which appear in subsections
7-7-2-1(A) and (B) of this chapter.
PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW): A "treatment works", as defined by
section 212 of the act (33 USC 1292) which is owned by the city. This
definition includes any devices or systems used in the collection, storage,
treatment, recycling, and reclamation of sewage or industrial wastes of a
liquid nature and any conveyances which convey wastewater to a treatment plant.
The term also means the city.
SEPTIC TANK WASTE: Any sewage from holding tanks such as vessels, chemical
toilets, campers, trailers, and septic tanks.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production (cf. 403.17(a)(2)).

   (B)   A user that:
      1.   Discharges an average of twenty five thousand (25,000) gallons per
day (gpd) or more of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary,
noncontact cooling, and boiler blowdown wastewater); or
      2.   Contributes a process waste stream which makes up five percent (5%)
or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW
treatment plant; or
      3.   Is designated as such by the city on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
   (C)   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsection (B) of
this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's
operation or for violating any applicable pretreatment standard or requirement,
the city may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition
received from a user and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6)
determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial
user.
SLUG LOAD OR SLUG DISCHARGE: Any discharge at a flow rate or concentration
which could cause a violation of the discharge standards in sections
7-7-2-1 through
7-7-2-4 of this chapter or any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
including, but not limited to, an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch
discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause pass-through or
interference.

(Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-2: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS (EPA 2.2):
The national categorical pretreatment standards as amended and promulgated by
EPA pursuant to the act and as found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405-471, are hereby incorporated and shall be enforceable under this chapter.
(Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-3: STATE REQUIREMENTS (EPA 2.3):
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by
all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this
chapter or in other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-4: LOCAL LIMITS (EPA 2.4):
Pollutant limits shall be established by resolution of the city council to
protect against pass-through and interference. No SIU shall discharge
wastewater containing pollutant levels in excess of the daily maximum allowable
discharge limits.
The limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW
(end of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total"
metal unless indicated otherwise. The city may impose mass limitations in
addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations. Where a user
is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given
pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall
apply. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-5: CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION (EPA 2.5):
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in industrial
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENT (EPA 2.6):
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
federal pretreatment requirement. A special agreement shall not constitute, nor
be construed as a replacement for, an industrial wastewater discharge permit.
However, if applicable, industrial users may request a net/gross adjustment to
a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request
a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the approval
authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-7: DILUTION (EPA 2.7):
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on users which he believes
may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-8: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES (EPA 2.8):
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the state, or the city, whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-9: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS (EPA
2.9):
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards
shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city
shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not
covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when
the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the federal
categorical pretreatment standards.
New sources and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have
in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any industrial wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall
not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Any other existing user or a
categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit which is in
noncompliance with any local limit shall be required to comply with a
compliance schedule to ensure compliance within the shortest time feasible. The
compliance schedule may be included in a control mechanism, administrative
order or compliance order, or other appropriate enforcement or control remedy.
(Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-10: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES (EPA 2.10):
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, issue an industrial wastewater discharge
permit solely for flow equalization, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other actions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand, except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
the user's expense.
   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-2-11: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS (EPA 2.11):
The city may require any user to develop and implement an accidental spill
prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the
city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of
pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city
for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which
user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within
one hundred eighty (180) days after notification by the city. The city may
develop such a plan for any user (cf. section 3.3 EPA model: January 2007 EPA
833-B-06-002). Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified
after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user
from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan

sewage collection system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261.
      Such notification shall include:
      1.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261;
      2.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
      3.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
      4.   If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100)
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the sewer system, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent it is
known or readily available to the industrial user:
         (a)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
         (b)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream(s) discharged during that calendar month; and
         (c)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream(s)
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
      All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180)
days after the discharge(s) commences. Any notification under this subsection
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under this chapter.
      The notification requirements of this section do not apply to pollutants
already reported by industrial users under self-monitoring requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A) of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which an
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, an industrial user shall notify the
city, the EPA region 10 office of air, waste, and toxics director, and the
Idaho department of health and welfare, division of environmental quality
remediation section, of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, an industrial
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)

proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the
samples must be representative of the discharges and authorization
documentation included in the users' files. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols,
and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in sections
7-7-4-1 (pertaining to BMRs),
7-7-4-2 (pertaining to FCRs), and
7-7-4-3 (pertaining to periodic compliance reports for categorical and
noncategorical SIUs) of this chapter, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports, the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (D)   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by
the city and specified in the user's industrial wastewater discharge permit.
For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula at
40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its
local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s). Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) the adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the city and included in the industrial user's file.
   (E)   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling
and methods of analysis and shall certify that the waste stream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in
its industrial wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR part
136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as
part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-5-2: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS (EPA 5.2):

7-7-9: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
7-7-9-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION (EPA 9.1):
When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of
such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-9-2: CONSENT ORDERS (EPA 9.2):
The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
7-7-9-4 and
7-7-9-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2020-018,

be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-
19-2020)
7-7-9-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS (EPA 9.4):
When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user
does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-9-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS (EPA 9.5):
When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-
19-2020)
7-7-9-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES (EPA 9.6):
   (A)   When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed interest at the same rate and in the same manner as that
established by the federal government for the internal revenue service for
unpaid taxes and penalties (currently 6 percent on the date of adoption
hereof). A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the city may convene a hearing on the matter within thirty (30) days of
receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-
19-2020)
7-7-9-7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS (EPA 9.7):
The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to
the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or which
presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The city shall allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in section
7-7-9-8 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future recurrence, to the city prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under sections
7-7-9-3 and
7-7-9-8 of this chapter.
   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-9-8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (EPA 9.8):
In addition to the provisions in section
7-7-3-12 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   (A)   Violation of industrial wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in section
7-7-2 of this chapter.
   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under section
7-7-9-3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-10: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
7-7-10-1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (EPA 10.1):

issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may petition the district court of the fifth judicial district of the state of
Idaho in and for the county of Twin Falls through the city's attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on
activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-10-2: CIVIL PENALTIES (EPA 10.2):
   (A)   A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the city for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   (B)   The city may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-
19-2020)

with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion
of the city. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-12: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
7-7-12-1: UPSET (EPA 12.1):
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the city and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within 5 days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of their treatment facilities until the facilities
are restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord.
2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-12-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS (EPA 12.2):
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections
7-7-2-1(A) and (B)3 through (B)7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference
and that either: a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-
through or interference; or b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its IPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-2020)
7-7-12-3: BYPASS (EPA 12.3):
   (A)   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   Occurrence Of Bypass: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   (D)   Bypass Prohibition And Conditions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of
this section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection (D)1 of this section. (Ord. 2020-018, 10-19-

source in such a manner that water from a private source will never pass
through the same pipes that carry any water from the public source except as
may be approved by the city council, water superintendent and state department
of health and welfare. Such approval shall be contingent upon the owner, at his
expense, adequately testing the private water source to assure the water
superintendent that the private source is not and has not become polluted and
the construction of an approved positive air separation or reduced pressure
backflow prevention system, or double check valve device between the private
source and the public water line to guarantee that no water from the private
source can enter a public water line if a negative pressure should occur in the
public water line, all as required by law. (Ord. 1758, 3-15-1976; amd. 1980)
   (G)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere
with or supersede any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Idaho

Service connections or meters installed in new subdivisions which require
relocation will be relocated by city forces. Any cost for relocation of service
connections or meter relocations will be the responsibility of the person
requesting said relocation. The cost of relocation or removal will be based
upon actual time, equipment and materials expended by city forces in doing said
work. Until said cost is paid by the person requesting same, no water service
will be provided to said location. (Ord. 2399, 1-4-1993)
   (D)   A separate and independent building water line and service connection
shall be provided for every building, except where one building stands at the
rear of another on an interior lot and no public water line is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or
driveway, the water superintendent may allow the front building water line to
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building water
line, but the city does not and will not assume any obligation or
responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single
connection aforementioned.
When such connection is allowed through one meter, it shall be assumed that
each user uses an equal portion of the total volume of water passing through
such meter and each such user shall be charged for water service as though he
were on a separate meter. A violation of the water or wastewater regulations 1
by one user which results in termination of service will cause termination of
service to all of the other users on such a connection.

rebuilt or repaired, and the owner shall fail or neglect to build, rebuild or
repair the same, the same may be done by the Superintendent of Streets or by
the contractors who may agree to do the same, and such contract shall be
awarded to the lowest responsible bidder therefor. The City Clerk shall, as the
City Council may direct, advertise for bids for the construction of sidewalks
in a newspaper published in the City.
The Clerk shall, upon the passage of any order or resolution of the Council
directing the building or repair of any sidewalk, cause a written notice to be
served on the owner or owners of the property abutting, fronting on or adjacent
to the sidewalks to be constructed, notifying them to construct the same in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and the order or resolution
directing the construction of the same, within fifteen (15) days from the date
of the service of said notice, which notice may be served by delivering a copy
thereof to the owner or owners, his or their agent, or by leaving a copy
thereof at the usual place of abode of the owner with any member of the owner’s
family over the age of fifteen (15) years. In case any owner is a nonresident,
or his place of abode cannot be found, then the Clerk shall cause said notice
to be published for four (4) weeks in a newspaper published in the City.
If, at the expiration of the time for which said notice is given, the said
sidewalk shall not be built by the owner of the property abutting, fronting on
or adjacent to the same, then the Superintendent of Streets or contractor shall
proceed as soon as practicable to construct the proper sidewalk as provided by
this Code, and in accordance with the order or resolution directing the
construction of the same.
When any sidewalk shall need repairing or rebuilding to conform to the
requirements of this Code, the Superintendent of Streets may cause notice
signed by the City Clerk to be given to the owner of the property fronting on
or abutting on or adjacent to such walk requiring the repair to be made within
fifteen (15) days, or the rebuilding to be done in fifteen (15) days. The
serving of notice shall be made in the same manner as provided above and if the
same is not repaired or rebuilt within the time above specified, it may be
repaired or rebuilt by the Superintendent of Streets or contractor in the same
manner and upon the same terms as provided for first construction.
As soon as the building, rebuilding or repairing of any sidewalk shall be
completed, the sidewalk shall be inspected by the City Engineer, and if it be
constructed or repaired in conformity with this Code and the order or
resolution ordering the same and the contract, if one is made, a certificate
shall be issued to the Superintendent of Streets or contractor as the case may
be, which shall state the amount of sidewalk constructed by the Superintendent
of Streets or contractor, the street or avenue, where constructed and the
description of the lots and blocks in front of, abutting on or adjacent to
which such sidewalk is built and the amount due for that fronting on, abutting
or adjacent to each lot.
Upon the presentation of one or more such certificates to the City Clerk, he
shall assess the amount of such certificates separately upon the lots fronting,
abutting on or adjacent to the sidewalks built or repaired, and record and file
the assessment roll in his office. At the next regular meeting of the City
Council the Clerk shall notify said Council of the fact that he has made such
assessment.
The City Clerk shall immediately thereafter give the lot owner notice of such
assessment by publication for a period of three (3) days in a newspaper
published in the City, notifying such owner to appear before the Council at its
next regular meeting, giving time and place of such meeting, that such property
owner may be heard before the Council as to the justness and correctness of the
amount so assessed.
In case the owner shall fail to pay such assessment or fail to appear and make
objections or shall fail to have his objections sustained by the Council, then
the assessment, unless the same be paid within ten (10) days after such
hearing, shall be certified by the City Clerk to the proper County officer
having custody of the tax list of Twin Falls County, at the time the said
certificate is made, in the same manner as other City taxes are certified to
said officer.
All such assessments shall be known as special assessments for sidewalk, and
shall be levied and collected as a separate tax in addition to the taxes for
general revenue purposes to be placed on the tax roll for collection, subject
to the same penalties and collected in the same manner as other City taxes.
As soon as the City Clerk has so certified such assessment he shall draw and
issue a warrant to the contractor or Superintendent of Streets as the case may
be for the amount called for in the certificate by the City Engineer upon the
sidewalk fund which shall be signed by the proper officers of the City and
registered in the office of the City Treasurer.
All warrants so issued shall be payable out of the moneys collected by the
County Collector from said sidewalk assessment and the City shall in no event
be liable on such warrants except to the amount collected from said assessment.
When any warrant drawn on the sidewalk fund is presented to the City Treasurer
for payment and there are no funds in the Treasury for the payment of the same,
the Treasurer shall endorse upon the back of said warrant the date of
presentation for payment with words “No Funds”

Section shall, at the conclusion of each hearing conducted pursuant to this
Section, determine whether the storage of the vehicle was valid or invalid. If

officer shall prepare and date a written finding to that effect, copies of
which shall be given to the owner of the vehicle and to the Police Department.

annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, Statute or other provision of

waiving any right of the Municipality under any section or provision existing

Whenever a violation of this Title occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any
person may file a written complaint. Such complaint shall fully state the
causes and basis of the same and shall be filed with the Administrator. The
Administrator shall properly record such complaint, immediately investigate the
same and take such action, or cause the same to be taken thereon as provided by
this Title 1 . The City Attorney shall, in addition to taking whatever criminal
action is deemed necessary, take steps to civilly enjoin any violation of this
Title.
Any violation of the provisions of this Title or any failure to comply with any
of its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Each day such violation
continues beyond notice shall be considered a separate offense. The land owner,
tenant, subdivider, builder, public official or any other person who commits,
participates in, assists in or maintains such continuing violation may be found
guilty of a separate offense for each day the violation continues as aforesaid.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Council or any other public official
or private citizen from taking such lawful action as it necessary to restrain
or prevent any violation of this Title or the Idaho Code.
Provided, however, that where property has been made nonconforming or where an
existing nonconforming use has been increased by the exercise of eminent
domain, it shall not be a violation and no penalty, either civil or criminal,
shall result. Persons desiring to change or modify the use of said
nonconforming properties in a manner which would, but for the exercise of
eminent domain, be permitted outright, may apply for a special use permit,
which permit may be granted with due consideration given to the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens of the City.
Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions of this Title shall be
punishable by imprisonment for a term not to exceed ninety (90) days, a fine
not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) or by both such fine and

located in the residential business zoning district should be preserved in
their present form and use. Where this is not feasible, individual residences
should be allowed to convert into residential business developments. In cases
where existing structures and site conditions are prohibitive for conversion,
two (2) or more existing lots may be assembled and developed as residential
business uses, thereby consolidating site access and creating a more rational
parking layout. Once a particular property has been converted to a residential
business use, it shall not be allowed to revert to a residential use.

10-7-11: ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES:
   (A)   Intent And Purpose: In the development and adoption of this section,
it is recognized that there are some adult business uses which, due to their
very nature, have serious, objectionable, operational characteristics,
particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods,
thereby having a deleterious impact upon property values and the quality of
life in such surrounding areas. It has been acknowledged by communities across
the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in
regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure
that these adverse secondary effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods nor endanger the well being of the youth
in their communities. The special regulations deemed necessary to control the
undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth below.
The primary purpose of these controls and regulations is to preserve the
integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, to deter the spread of
urban blight and to protect minors from the objectionable, operational
characteristics of these adult uses by restricting their close proximity to
churches, parks, schools, restaurants, movie theaters and residential areas.
This section is not intended and should not be construed to create a
contemporary community standard nor to allow the sale, loan, distribution,
dissemination, presentation or exhibition of material or live conduct which is
obscene or which is in violation of any other law, nor to permit the creation
or maintenance of any moral nuisance. (Ord. 2238, 6-20-1988)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2014.gif]
      3.   The area of a spherical, cylindrical or other three-dimensional sign
shall be measured by calculating the area of a two-dimensional drawing of the
largest elevation of the sign. For example, if a sign is cylindrical like the
shape to the left, the area of sign is not the entire surface area (like a
label peeled off a can) but the size of the shape if it was flattened to two
(2) dimensions.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2016.gif]
   (B)   Where a sign has two (2) faces, the area of the largest sign face
shall be used to determine the area of the sign provided the two (2) faces are
within sixty degrees (60°) of parallel. Where a sign has two (2) or more faces
that are greater than sixty degrees (60°) from parallel, the sign area shall
either be calculated as the sum of the area of each face, or the sign will
constitute two (2) signs (a V-sign). A V-sign is allowed at the corner of a
property with two (2) street frontages.
   (C)   The area of wall signs containing multiple elements shall be
calculated as follows:
      1.   Regardless of the spacing between letters, letters forming a word or
name shall be considered a single sign.
      2.   When two (2) or more separate items in a sign, such as a word and
logo, are separated horizontally or vertically by less than the width or height
of the largest item, the items shall be considered a single sign and the area
shall be determined by measuring the area enclosing the sign elements with
straight, intersecting lines.
The following sign elements are considered one sign:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2018.gif]
      3.   When two (2) or more separate items in a sign, such as a word and
logo, are separated horizontally or vertically by more than the width or height
of the largest item, the items shall be considered separate signs and the area
of each item shall be determined individually.
The following sign elements are considered two (2) signs:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2020.gif]
   (D)   The vertical support structures of signs shall not be included in
calculating the area of the sign, but shall be included in the measurement of
the height of the sign.
   (E)   The height of all signs shall be measured from the top edge of the
sign and/or support structure to the average finished grade of the ground below
the sign and/or support structure. If a sign is located on a mound, berm, or
other raised area for the sole purpose of increasing the height of the sign,
the height of the mound, berm, or other raised area shall be included in the
height of the sign. (Ord. 2957, 12-8-2008)

volumes on adjoining streets, additional right of way and paving in the form of
a deceleration lane or turn lane may be required to be furnished by the
landowner in order to reduce such interference. Projections of traffic shall be
based on analysis performed by the city engineer or designated official.
      2.   Additional right of way or paving requirements may be reviewed and

10-10-12: REGULATIONS FOR PARKING OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
The purpose of the parking overlay districts is established to accommodate the
need for off street parking ratio alternatives in accordance with traffic
patterns, ultimate densities and coordinated use of lands within the city. It
is intended that the respective districts with which the parking district is
combined shall have requirements particular to the land and uses which warrant
off street parking variables to be applied.
The following regulations of this section shall apply to all land classified as
a "parking district" (P). All uses are permitted in the respective district
with which the P district is combined, subject to the provisions of those
districts. If any of the regulations specified in this section differ from
corresponding regulations specified for a district with which the P district is
combined, then the regulations of this district shall govern.
   (A)   Parking district 1:
      1.   The boundary of the P1 district is defined as illustrated on the
current zoning district map.
      2.   No off street parking is required within the P1 district as
designated for outright permitted uses, but may be required through the special
use permit required by the commission or council. This provision does not
exempt any use from the requirements for off street loading.
   (B)   Parking district 2:
      1.   The boundary of the P2 district is defined as illustrated on the
current zoning district map.
      2.   The off street parking requirement in the P2 district is thirty
percent (30%) less than that required outside of the P districts except that
household dwellings of less than five (5) units shall provide two (2) spaces
per unit. This provision does not exempt any use from the full requirements for
off street loading.
   (C)   Parking district 3:
      1.   The boundary of the P3 district is defined as illustrated on the
current zoning district map.
      2.   Due to the desire of the city to retain the character of the P3
district special consideration may be given on a case by case basis to the
parking requirements, if the standard requirements cannot be applied. Examples
of special consideration may be a variance, leased parking, and remote parking.

driveway approaches. The standard depressed curb type approach shall be
constructed unless otherwise directed by the city engineer. An arterial street
driveway approach, with rounded curbing, may be required by the city engineer
when traffic conditions on arterial streets warrant a more rapid entrance and
exit through the driveway approach. This decision of the city engineer
requiring an arterial street driveway approach may be appealed to the city
council. Nothing in this subsection should be construed to prevent the
construction of an arterial street driveway approach, if desired by the
property owner. (Ord. 2468, 12-19-1994)

exceed forty feet (40') nor be less than thirty feet (30') except one-way
approaches which shall not be less than twelve feet (12'). There shall be at
least thirty two feet (32') of curb between driveways and at least eighteen
feet (18') of straight curb between the end of a driveway and the end of a
corner radius and at least two feet (2') between the end of a driveway and a
side property line. (Ord. 2773, 12-15-2003)

not practical due to some existing condition. The public welfare, safety and
convenience shall be considered in granting such applications.
         d.   Additional Driveway Width Allowed: The city engineer may allow
additional driveway width under the following conditions: the street is not an
arterial or collector street; the traffic generated by the land use is minimal
(no high traffic generating retail trade uses, services, residential uses or

   (D)   Drainage To U.S. Waters Or Canals: No drainage shall be allowed from a
building site directly to any waters of the United States or to any privately
owned canal system.
   (E)   Residential Subdivisions:
      1.   All residential subdivisions shall design and construct storm water
retention facility or facilities to retain the 50-year 24-hour rainstorm event.
Refer to subsection
10-11-9(C)5c(4) of this chapter to determine the volume requirements.
      2.   The storm water shall be detained and released over a forty eight
(48) hour period or at a rate that is approved by the Twin Falls canal company
or by any other entity that may govern the waterway downstream.
      3.   The storm water dischargers releasing water from their retention
area shall use best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the amount of
pollutants from the water. Discharge water quality shall comply with the most
current regulations or standards that may apply.
      4.   The retention facilities shall also have an overflow device that can
convey the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm event, without damage to the retention
facility. This structure should be designed to minimize any downstream safety
problems.
      5.   Storm sewers shall be placed in a public right of way or minimum
fifteen foot (15') wide easement. Easements shall also be required for the

discharge of storm water will be allowed from these areas.
   (G)   Procedure For Review And Approval Of The Storm Water Management Plan:
      Note: Review and approval by the city does not constitute an engineering
review of project plans and calculations. The review is for the purpose of
ensuring general conformance to city policies and requirements. The submitting
engineer is solely responsible for the design. All submissions to the city
shall be stamped by a professional engineer registered in the state.
      The following shall be submitted to the city:
      1.   Topographic survey of the development showing all drainage and
irrigation water conveyance systems within the area encompassed by a line two
hundred feet (200') outside the property line.
      2.   Peak flow calculations, with peak flows delineated on the drawings.
      3.   Runoff volume calculations.
      4.   Plans and profiles of new or modified drainage and irrigation water
conveyance systems.
      5.   Plans, profiles and calculations for storm water retention or
detention facilities.
      6.   Flood routing computations for the 100-year flood through any
existing drainage conveyance systems.
      7.   Maintenance and operation manuals for storm water facilities.
      8.   Infiltration rates where applicable.
      9.   Seasonal high ground water table elevations where applicable. This
applies when the absorption of stormwater is used as a best management
practice.
      Note: Facilities using absorption designs shall not intercept the
postdevelopment ground water table. The bottom of the facility shall have a
minimum four feet (4') vertical separation from the seasonal high ground water
elevation and bedrock. The four foot (4') separation between the bottom of the
facility and the seasonal high ground water table shall contain a sandy loam
material to treat the water prior to entering the ground water. If the best
management practices are utilized to pretreat the water prior to discharge into
the absorption facility, the requirement for four foot (4') of sandy loam will
be waived.
      The seasonal high ground water table elevation shall be established and
used for the facility design. The elevation of the seasonal high ground water
table shall be determined by a monitoring well established at the facility site
and monitored during the high ground water season. If available, Twin Falls
health department ground water records may be used to establish the probable
highest ground water elevation. The high ground water elevation shall be shown
on the plans and be referenced to a nearby bench mark, the latitude and
longitude of the well shall be shown on the plans. If ground water is
encountered during construction of the facility at an elevation higher than
that shown on the plans, the facility shall be redesigned to account for the
higher elevation.
      10.   Soil classifications where applicable.
      11.   Flood routing of the 100-year storm to the ultimate drainage
system.
      12.   Copies of associated permits and discharge agreements.
      13.   Copy of the pollution prevention plan that is on file with EPA for
the development.
      Note: Prior to beginning of construction on any development site larger
than five (5) acres, the developer or their representative must have a
pollution prevention plan in place and must file a notice of intent (NOI) with
the EPA, in accordance with NPDES (national pollutant discharge elimination
system) requirements. The pollution prevention plan will include provisions for
reducing sediment discharges from the construction site and tracking of mud
onto roadways. A copy of this plan and the NOI shall be provided to the city
prior to any site grading. Refer to 40 CFR chapter 1 section 122.26 stormwater
discharges for NPDES requirements.
   (H)   Approval And Completion:
      1.   A site plan conforming to the minimum requirements of this section
shall be submitted for approval as part of the application for a building
permit to construct any building.
      2.   All requirements found within the Drainage and Storm Water
Management section shall be completed prior to issuance of any Certificate of
Occupancy. (Ord. 2481, 5-1-1995; amd. Ord. 2024-012, 9-9-2024)
10-11-10: FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS:
   (A)   Statutory Authority :
      1.   The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code §§ 46-
1020, 46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments to adopt floodplain
management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum floodplain
development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human life, health,
and property. Therefore, the Council of the City of Twin Falls, Idaho does
hereby ordain as follows:
      2.   Findings Of Fact:
         a.   The flood hazard areas of City of Twin Falls are subject to
periodic inundation that results in: loss of life and property; health and
safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary
public expenditures for flood relief and protection; and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
         b.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard
areas, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
         c.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for
planning, adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management.
      3.   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this section is to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
         a.   Protect human life, health, and property;
         b.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
         c.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood prone areas;
         d.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         e.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated
with flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         f.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         g.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified the property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
         h.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
      4.   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to
accomplish its purpose, this section includes methods and provisions to:
         a.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         b.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
         c.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage or erosion;
         d.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
         e.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters.
   (B)   Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section shall be interpreted according to the meaning they have in
common usage and which give this section its most reasonable application.
   (C)   General Provisions:
      1.   Lands To Which This Section Applies: This section shall apply to all
special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of City of Twin Falls.
Nothing in this section is intended to allow uses or structures that are
otherwise prohibited by the zoning ordinance.
      2.   Basis For Special Flood Hazard Areas: The special flood hazard areas
(SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its
flood insurance study (FIS) for City of Twin Falls, dated May 1, 1984, with
accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) or digital flood insurance rate
maps (DFIRM), and other supporting data, are adopted by reference and declared
a part of this section. The FIS and the FIRM are on file at City of Twin Falls,
203 Main Avenue, East Room 218.
      3.   Establishment Of Floodplain Development Permit: A Floodplain
Development Permit (FDP) shall be required in conformance with the provisions
of this section prior to the commencement of any development activities within
special flood hazard areas (SFHA) determined in accordance with the provisions
of Part (D), Section 2.
      4.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located,
extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance
with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
      5.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This section shall not in any
way repeal, abrogate, impair, or remove the necessity of compliance with any
other laws, ordinances, regulations, easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions, etcetera. However, where this section and another ordinance
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes more stringent or greater restrictions
shall control.
      6.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this
section all provisions shall be:
         a.   Considered as minimum requirements;
         b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
      7.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
section does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas (SFHA)
or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of City of Twin
Falls, or by any officer or employee thereof, for flood damages that result
from reliance on this section or an administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
      8.   Penalties For Violation: No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted, or altered unless in full compliance with the
terms of this section and other applicable regulations. Violation of the
provisions of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements,
including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this section or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred and eighty (180)
days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Twin Falls from
taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.

applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures
(including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements,
repairs of substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such
buildings and structures), the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with
the Building Official, shall:
            (1)   Estimate the market value or require the applicant to obtain
an appraisal of the market value, prepared by a qualified independent
appraiser, of the building or structure before the start of construction of the
proposed work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or
structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any
repairs are made;
            (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, and the combined costs
of improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building
or structure;
            (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
            (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the adopted
Idaho Building Code and this ordinance is required.
      4.   Corrective Procedures:
         a.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the Floodplain Administrator
finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her
duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The
owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited
in such notification.
         b.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the
owner of a building or property fails to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating:
            (1)   That the building or property is in violation of the
floodplain management regulations (FMR);
            (2)   That a hearing will be held before the Floodplain
Administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days
after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be
heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining
to the matter; and
            (3)   That following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building, or to remove fill,
as applicable.
         c.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held pursuant
to the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that
the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention
ordinance (FDPO), he or she shall issue an order in writing to the owner,
requiring the owner to remedy the violation within a specified time period, not
less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor more than one hundred-eighty (180)
calendar days. Where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is imminent
danger to life or other property, he or she may order that corrective action be
taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
         d.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective
action may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the clerk
within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of
an appeal, the order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local
governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm,
modify and affirm, or revoke the order.
         e.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or
property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no
appeal has been made or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished at the discretion of the court.
      5.   Variance Procedures:
         a.   The City Council of Twin Falls, hereinafter referred to as the
"appeal board," shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this section.
         b.   Variances may be issued for:
            (1)   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
            (2)   Functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the
definition as stated in subsection (B) of this section, provided provisions of
subsection (D) 5. i.ii, iii, and v, have been satisfied, and such facilities
are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety; or (note these refs are
incomplete )
            (3)   Any other type of development, provided it meets the
requirements of this section.
         c.   In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
subsections of this section, and:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as
defined under subsection (B) of this section as a functionally dependent
facility, where applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         d.   The applicant shall include a written report addressing each of
the above factors in subsection (D), 5. c. (1) - (9) with their application for
a variance.
         e.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes
of this section, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
section.
         f.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE)
and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such
construction below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00)
per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification
shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance.
         g.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the State of Idaho, upon request.
         h.   Conditions For Variances:

structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
            (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
or flood fringe area if the variance would result in any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge.
            (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
            (4)   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit
approval.
            (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
               A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and
               C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         i.   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or
sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical
storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas (SFHA),
provided that all of the following conditions are met:

appeal such decision to the Court, as provided in Idaho Code 67-6535.
   (E)   Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction:
      1.   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), the
following provisions are required:
         a.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure.
         b.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA).
         c.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
         d.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be

to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
         g.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
         h.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor shall:
            (1)   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least
to the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE); and
            (2)   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
               A.   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
               B.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least
one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
               C.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each
enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically
enter and exit;
               D.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no

               E.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
               F.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
         i.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this section, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this section.
         j.   Nothing in this section shall prevent the repair, reconstruction,
or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of
this section and located totally or partially within the floodway, flood fringe
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the

management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in subsection (D) 5.i. A
structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or
to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility
may be located in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) only if the structure or
tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the flood protection
elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions of subsection (D)
3.c.
         l.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and determined to be
reasonably safe from flooding.
         m.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
         n.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
         o.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
         p.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area (SFHA), the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new
construction and substantial improvements.
         q.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in
a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions
for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
      2.   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA) where
base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in subsections
(C) 2., or (E) 4., the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of
subsection (E) 1., are required:

improvements, and development of any commercial, industrial, or other
nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated no lower than the flood protection elevation (FPE), as defined in
subsection (B) of this section. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and
A1-30 may be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation (FPE) in lieu of
elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, below the flood protection elevation (FPE) are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AH and AO Zones, the
floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with subsection (E) 6.b. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in subsection
(D) 3.c, along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
         c.   Manufactured Homes:

the requirements of subsection (E) 2.d.
            (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
         d.   Additions/Improvements:
            (1)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
               A.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure; or
               B.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
            (2)   Additions to post-FIRM structures that are a substantial
improvement with no modifications to the existing structure other than a
standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with
the standards for new construction.
            (3)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when
the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications

improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
               B.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
            (4)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten
(10) year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building
or structure, the ten (10) year period begins on the date of the first
improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective
date of this section. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
               A.   Any project for improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living
conditions; or
               B.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
         e.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall be either:
            (1)   Temporary Placement: Be on site for fewer than one hundred
and eighty (180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway

square feet and is a minimal investment of seven thousand five hundred dollars
($7,500.00) or less and satisfies the criteria outlined in 2. a. through g.
above is not required to meet the elevation or floodproofing standards of
subsection (E) 2.b.
         h.   Tanks: When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within
a special flood hazard area (SFHA), the following criteria shall be met:
            (1)   Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the base flood, including the
effects of buoyancy (assuming the tank is empty);
            (2)   Elevated above-ground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be
attached to an elevated to or above the design flood elevation on a supporting
structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement
during conditions of the base flood. Tank-supporting structures shall meet the
foundation requirements of the applicable flood hazard area;
            (3)   Not elevated above-ground tanks that do not meet the
elevation requirements of subsection (E) 2.b of this section shall be permitted
in flood hazard areas provided the tanks are anchored or otherwise designed and
constructed to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty and the effects of
flood-borne debris.
            (4)   Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets, and vents shall be:
                  A.   At or above the flood protection elevation or fitted
with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tanks during conditions of the base flood; and
                  B.   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during
conditions of the base flood.
         i.   Construction Of Below-Grade Crawlspace:
            (1)   The interior grade of a crawlspace must not be below the BFE
and must not be more than two (2) feet below the exterior lowest adjacent grade
(LAG).
            (2)   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the
interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall,
must not exceed four (4) feet at any point.
            (3)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should
be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event.
            (4)   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed
five (5) feet per second for any crawlspace.
            See Technical Bulletin 11 for further information.
            Caution:
            Buildings that have below-grade crawlspaces may have higher flood
insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation of the crawlspace soil at or above
the base flood elevation (BFE).
         j.   Other Development In Regulated Floodways And Flood Fringe:
            (1)   Fences that have the potential to block the passage of
floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences, in regulated
floodways and flood fringe shall meet the limitations of subsection (E) 2.b. of
this section.
            (2)   Retaining walls, bulkheads, sidewalks, and driveways that
involve the placement of fill in regulated floodways and flood fringe shall
meet the limitations of subsection (E) 5. of this section.
            (3)   Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges,
culverts, low-water crossings, and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to
travel from one side of a watercourse to the other side, which encroach into
regulated floodways and flood fringe, shall meet the limitations of subsection
(E) 5. of this section.
            (4)   Drilling water, oil, and/or gas wells including fuel storage
tanks, apparatus, and any equipment at the site that encroach into regulated
floodways and flood fringe shall meet the limitations of subsection (E) 5. of
this section.

facilities, port facilities, shipbuilding, and ship repair facilities that
encroach into regulated floodways and flood fringe shall meet the limitations
of subsection (E) 5. of this section.
         k.   Subdivision Plats in Flood Zones:
            (1)   A note must be provided on the final plat documenting the
current flood zone in which the property or properties are located. The
boundary line must be drawn on the plat in situations where two (2) or more
flood zones intersect over the property or properties being surveyed.
            (2)   FEMA FIRM panel(s): #160xxxxxxC, & 160xxxxxxE, etc.
               FIRM effective date(s): mm/dd/year
               Flood Zone(s): Zone X, Zone A, Zone AE, A Zone AO, Zone, AH,
Zone D, etc.
               Base Flood Elevation(s): Example: (AE ____.0 ft., etc.)
               Flood Zones are subject to change by FEMA and all land within a
floodway or floodplain is regulated by _____________ chapter/section of the
City Code
10-11-9(C)1.
         l.   Critical Facilities: As a best practice, FEMA recommends
protection that exceeds code minimums. For example, FEMA 543, Design Guide for
Improving Critical Facility Safety from Flooding and High Winds (2007)
recommends protecting critical facilities to withstand at least a 0.2-percent-
annual-chance flood event (often called the "500-year flood event"). Flood
elevations for the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood may be greater than the
elevation specified by ASCE 24. If federal funding or other Federal action is
involved, the requirements of Executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management may
necessitate protection of critical actions to the 500-year flood elevation
(critical actions may include the construction and repair of critical
facilities).
      3.   Standards For Floodplains Without Established Base Flood Elevations:
Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Zone A (also known as
Unnumbered A Zones) and established in subsection (C) 2., where no base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in
addition to the provisions of subsection (E) 1., shall apply:
      The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be
determined based on the following criteria:
         a.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this section and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in subsections (E) 1. and
2.
         b.   When floodway or flood fringe data is available from a federal,
state, local or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements
within floodway and flood fringe areas shall also comply with the requirements
of subsections (E) 2. and 5.
         c.   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home
sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in
accordance with subsection (C) 2. and utilized in implementing this section.
         d.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, local, or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor
shall be elevated or floodproofed (non-residential) to two (2) feet above the
highest adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection
elevation (FPE), whichever is higher, as defined in subsection (B). All other
applicable provisions of subsection (E) 2. shall also apply.
      4.   Standards For Riverine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways Or Flood Fringe Areas:
      Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE) data is
provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor
flood fringe areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM
or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development
within such areas:
         a.   Standards of subsections (E) 1. and 2.; and
         b.   Until a regulatory floodway or flood fringe area is designated,
no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood at any point within the community.
      5.   Standards For Floodways And Flood Fringe Areas: Areas designated as
floodways or flood fringe areas are located within the special flood hazard
areas established in subsection (C) 2. The floodways and flood fringe areas are
extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion
potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions,
in addition to standards outlined in subsections (E) 1. and 2., shall apply to
all development within such areas:
         a.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
            (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
            (2)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been
approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within
six (6) months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
         b.   If subsection (E) 5.a. is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
         c.   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
            (1)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (E)
2.c.; and
            (2)   The encroachment standards of subsection (E) 5.a.
      6.   Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/
AH): Located within the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) established in
subsection (C) 2., are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to
three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to subsection
(E) 1. and 2., all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
         a.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two (2) feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
(2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
         b.   Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection (E) 6.a. so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that
level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is
required in accordance with subsections (D) 3.c, and (E) 2.b.
         c.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   (F)   Stormwater Management:
      1.   Any applicant for a building permit shall furnish satisfactory
engineering data to allow the city engineer to ascertain that any proposed
construction will comply with the following drainage criteria:
         a.   A conceptual drainage plan shall be presented and approved with
the preliminary plat or site plan. A drainage study shall be submitted and
approved before any improvement plans are reviewed.
         b.   The drainage study shall be prepared by a civil engineer
registered in the state. Refer to section
10-11-8 of this chapter for additional drainage requirements.
         c.   The drainage study and conceptual plan shall be submitted under
the following concepts:
            (1)   Drainage Patterns: Drainage flows of all frequencies should
enter and depart from the property to be developed in substantially the same
manner as predevelopment conditions.
            (2)   Street Relationships/Emergency Access: All lots, structures,
etc., within a development shall be accessible by at least one route during a
100-year storm with a maximum street water depth of one foot (1'). In all
cases, the flow of water shall be contained within rights of way.
      2.   In order to reduce the storm runoff as much as feasible, retention
facilities shall be sized for local (on site) stormwater using the following
procedures:
         a.   The design frequency shall be the fifty (50)-year storm, using
the twenty four (24)-hour rainfall depth "D" as determined from the National
Weather Service's isopluvials for Idaho. For the Twin Falls area the twenty
four (24)-hour rainfall on a fifty (50)-year storm frequency is 1.9 inches.
         b.   Volume requirements for the retention facility are calculated by
the following method:
Vt  = 1.9 A  
    12
     
Vt  = Volume required (acre-feet)
     
1.9 = 24 hour rainfall depth (inch) on a 50-year storm frequency
     
A   = Tributary area
 
         c.   Where possible, the retention facility shall have four to one (4:
1) side slopes.
   (G)   Legal Status Provisions:
      1.   Effect On Rights And Liabilities Under The Existing Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance: This section, in part, comes forward by re-enactment of
some of the provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance enacted July 6,
1981 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact
and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so
that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and
may be enforced. The enactment of this section shall not affect any action,
suit, or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance of City of Twin Falls enacted on July 6, 1981, as amended,
which are not reenacted herein are repealed.
      2.   Effect Upon Outstanding Floodplain Development Permits: Nothing
herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or
designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain
development permit (FDP) has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or
his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this section.
Provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding
permit within a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days subsequent to the
date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this section.
   (H)   Approval And Completion:
      1.   A site plan conforming to the minimum requirements of this section
shall be submitted for approval as part of the application for a building
permit to construct any building.
      2.   All requirements found within the Flood Plain regulations section
shall be completed prior to issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy. (Ord.

Idaho, for the purpose of sale or conveyance in its entirety or interests
thereon defined. No building permit shall be issued until a final plat is
approved, filed of record and public improvements accepted in accordance with
the provisions of Title 10 of the City of Twin Falls City Code. Selling a
portion of this property by metes and bounds, except as shown on an approved,

affecting the size or shape of a structure or the placement of the structure
upon lots, or the size of lots and public ways.
   (B)   Authority To Grant: The commission may authorize in specific cases
such variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship or the loss of a building or site that is on a
national, state or local register of historic places or sites.
   (C)   Application: A variance from the terms of this title shall not be
granted by the commission unless and until a written application for a variance

standards:

peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this title.
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
         e.   That a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship. For purposes of this section, where a
reasonable conforming use is, or can be, located on a lot or parcel, there is
no unnecessary hardship.
      A variance shall not be granted unless the commission makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it
which support conclusions that the above mentioned standards and conditions
have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 2466, 2-6-1995)

objectives or with any specific objective of a comprehensive plan and/or zoning

neighboring uses.

services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
      6.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community.
      7.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property or
to the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,

designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public

permit shall not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant
other special use permit.

determine if the facts and circumstances have changed; the commission may call
for a new special use permit application.
   A special use which has been discontinued for a period of one year shall not
be reestablished without a new special use permit. (Ord. 2620, 8-2-1999)

the commission, the council shall set a hearing date, under the same provisions
as the commission hearing, to consider all information, testimony and the

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
SECTION:

11-1-13: Penalty For Violation
11-1-1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The city council of the city of Twin Falls, Twin Falls County,, Idaho, finds
that:
   (A)   Based on the city of Twin Falls comprehensive plan adopted by the city
pursuant to chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general
governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, it is necessary that the city’s public facilities for: 1)
police, 2) fire/emergency medical services (EMS), 3) parks and recreation, and
4) streets be expanded and improved to accommodate new development within the
city. Throughout this chapter, the system improvements for these four (4) types
of public facilities are sometimes collectively referred to as the “city
capital facilities” and sometimes individually referred to as a “city capital
improvements element”.
   (B)   The city has formed the development impact fee advisory committee
required by Idaho Code section 67-8205, and that committee has performed the
duties required of it pursuant to such statute. The city intends that the
committee continue to exist and to perform those duties identified in Idaho
Code section 67-8205 that occur following the adoption of development impact
fees.
   (C)   New residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose
increasing and excessive demands upon city capital facilities.
   (D)   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential
development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary
improvements of these city capital facilities to accommodate new development.
   (E)   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever
increasing demands on the city to provide and expand city capital facilities to
serve new development.
   (F)   The city has planned for the improvement of the city capital
facilities in the capital improvements element of the city of Twin Falls
comprehensive plan.
   (G)   Chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code (the Idaho development impact
fee act) authorizes the city to adopt a development impact fee system to
offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to
the city capital facilities caused by new development in the city.
   (H)   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would
promote the purposes set forth in the Idaho development impact fee act, in that
it would: 1) ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new
growth and development; 2) promote orderly growth and development by
establishing uniform standards by which local governments may require that
those who benefit from new growth and development pay a proportionate share of
the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development;
3) ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are required
to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public facilities
needed to serve new growth and development; and 4) prevent duplicate and ad hoc
development requirements.
   (I)   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would
enable the city to accommodate new development, and would assist the city to
implement the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
   (J)   In order to implement an equitable development impact fee system for
the city capital facilities, the city retained Galena Consulting to prepare an
impact fee study for these types of facilities. The resulting document is
titled “City Of Twin Falls, Idaho Impact Fee Study And Capital Improvement
Plans”, dated April 5, 2021 (the “development impact fee study”), and that
document is hereby incorporated by reference.
   (K)   The methodology used in preparing the development impact fee study,
when applied through this chapter, complies with all applicable provisions of
Idaho law, including those set forth in Idaho statutes sections 67-8204(2), 67-
8204(16), 67-8204(23), 67-8207 and 67-8209. The incorporation of the
development impact fee study by reference satisfies the requirement in Idaho
statutes section 67-8204(16) for a detailed description of the methodology by
which the development impact fees were calculated, and the requirement in Idaho
Code section 67-8204(24) for a description of acceptable levels of service for
system improvements.
   (L)   The development impact fee study contains the capital improvements
element of the city of Twin Falls comprehensive plan, and such element has been
prepared in conformance with the requirements of chapters 65 and 82 of title 67
of the Idaho Code.
   (M)   The development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies
and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on
the city capital facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities
created by new development.
   (N)   In accordance with Idaho Code, the development impact fee study was
based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
In addition, the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation
methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will
be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns
and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements,
including taxes, assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers.
   (O)   The development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the
development impact fee study, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for city capital facilities to serve new development that will pay
the development impact fees.
   (P)   The facilities for parks and recreation, streets, police, and fire/
emergency medical services (EMS) included in the calculation of fees in the
development impact fee study will benefit all new residential and
nonresidential development throughout the city, and it is therefore appropriate
to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of
calculating, collecting, and spending the development impact fees collected
from residential and nonresidential development.
   (Q)   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   (R)   This chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
new development will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the
costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for city capital
facilities in ways that benefit the development for which each development
impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the development
impact fee is paid, and in conformance with Idaho Code section 67-8210.
   (S)   This chapter creates a system under which development impact fees
shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital facilities,
or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements, or to pay for routine
operation or maintenance of those facilities.
   (T)   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8204(19).
   (U)   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of chapter
82, title 67, Idaho Code, concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord.
2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-2: AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY:
   (A)   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city’s general police power,
the authority granted to the city pursuant to chapters 65 and 82, title 67,
Idaho Code, and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all areas of the city. (Ord. 2021-017, 10-
11-2021)
11-1-3: INTENT:
   (A)   This chapter is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement,
the City of Twin Falls comprehensive plan, and particularly the capital
improvements element of that plan.
   (B)   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements to City capital facilities; to
ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of improvements
to such facilities required to accommodate new development; and to ensure that
funds collected from new development are actually used for improvements to City
capital facilities that benefit such new development.
   (C)   It is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital facilities to
new development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code.
   (D)   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
City capital facilities created by such new development.
   (E)   It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from
any development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be
commingled with monies from a different impact fee account, or ever be used for
a development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was
paid, or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the City capital
facilities or ever be used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain, or operate any
City facility. (Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-4: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following

11-1-5: DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES IMPOSED:
   (A)   Fee Obligation:
      1.   After the effective date hereof, any person who commences any impact
generating land development, except those exempted pursuant to subsection (B)
of this section, shall be obligated to pay development impact fees upon
commencement of such activity. The amount of the development impact fees shall
be determined in accordance with this chapter.
      2.   If the fee payer is applying for an extension of a permit issued
previously, then the development impact fees required to be paid shall be the
net increase between the development impact fees applicable at the time of the
current permit application and any development impact fees previously paid
pursuant to this chapter to finance similar types of system improvements to
accommodate demands created by the same development.
      3.   If the fee payer is applying for a permit to allow a change of use
or for the expansion, redevelopment, or modification of an existing
development, the development impact fees required to be paid shall be based on
the net increase in the development impact fees for the new use as compared to
the previous use.
   (B)   Exemptions: The following types of development shall be exempted from
payment of the development impact fees. Any claim for exemption shall be made
no later than the time when the applicant applies for the first building permit
for the proposed development that creates the obligation to pay the development
impact fees, and any claim for exemption not made at or before that time shall
have been waived. The Development Impact Fee Administrator or a designee shall
determine the validity of any claim for exemption pursuant to the criteria set
forth below:
      1.   Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure that was
destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, providing the structure is rebuilt and
ready for occupancy within two (2) years of its destruction;
      2.   Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not increase the
number of service units;
      3.   Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with
another residential unit on the same lot, provided that the number of service
units does not increase;
      4.   Constructing an addition on a residential structure that does not
increase the number of service units;
      5.   Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot;
      6.   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such
as tennis courts or clubhouses, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the
use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements;
      7.   The installation of a modular building, manufactured home, or
recreational vehicle if the fee payer can demonstrate by documentation such as
utility bills and tax records that either: a) a modular building, manufactured
home, or recreational vehicle was legally in place on the lot or space prior to
the effective date hereof, or b) a development impact fee has been paid
previously for the installation of a modular building, manufactured home or
recreational vehicle on that same lot or space;
      8.   Projects for which a development impact fee for each type of public
facility covered by this chapter has previously been paid in an amount that
equals or exceeds the development impact fee that would be required by this
chapter;
      9.   Projects built by the Federal government or the State government;
and,
      10.   Projects which meet all of the following criteria may apply for an
individualized assessment pursuant to subsection C4 of this section, except
that the applicant may simply rely on the documented project history rather
than retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment:
         a.   A development agreement was entered into by the project developer
and the City setting forth the entitlements and obligations of the developer,
which agreement was approved by the City Council prior to January 1, 2008; and
         b.   The final plat for the development, or site plan attached to the
development agreement, was approved by the City prior to January 1, 2008; and
         c.   The development, through the terms of the development agreement,
or otherwise, has built, or is obligated to build public facilities, which
facilities are not “project improvements”, in excess of the amount that would
be collected under this chapter.
   (C)   Fee Table And Calculation Of Amount Of Development Impact Fees:
      1.   Fee Table and subsequent increases:
Police fees:
 Residential    $218.00  per dwelling unit
 Nonresidential 0.1      per square foot
Fire fees:
 Residential    871.00   per dwelling unit
 Nonresidential 0.44     per square foot
Parks fees:
 Residential    1,512.00 per dwelling unit
 Nonresidential n/a       
Street fees:
 Single-family  1327.00  per dwelling unit
 Multi-family   710.00   per dwelling unit
 Retail         2.94     per square foot
 Office         1.75     per square foot
 Industrial     0.54     per square foot
 Institutional  0.33     per square foot
 
This fee schedule shall be in effect thirty (30) days after the approval of the
master Fee Schedule.
On January 1, 2023, and on January 1 of each year thereafter in which an impact
fee is in effect, the amount of the impact fee shall be automatically adjusted
to account for year over year inflation increases in the cost of providing
police, fire, parks and recreation, and street public facilities to serve new
development utilizing the latest available municipal cost index as published by
“American Cities And County Magazine”. Nothing herein shall prevent the city
from electing to maintain a then existing police, fire, parks and recreation,
and street impact fee or from electing to waive the inflation adjustment for
any given fiscal year, or years. Any such action to determine an inflation
factor shall be by city council resolution.
      2.   Levels Of Service: The levels of service upon which the foregoing
fees are calculated are as follows:
         a.   Police level of service from page 12 of the impact fee study is
1.48 officers per thousand population.
         b.   Fire level of service from page 15 of the impact fee study is
ninety percent (90%) of all calls to be responded to in a time of six (6)
minutes.
         c.   Parks and recreation level of service from page 19 of the impact
fee study is 4.7 developed acres per thousand population.
         d.   City Street level of service from page 24 of the impact fee study
is level of service C on arterials and collectors at the P.M. peak period.
      3.   Using The Fee Table: Development impact fees shall be calculated
using the fee table above (or as subsequently amended by Council per automatic
adjustments criteria above) unless: a) the fee payer requests an individualized
assessment pursuant to subsection (C)4 of this section, or b) the City
designates the proposed development as a development of extraordinary impact in
writing to the fee payer, in which case the provisions of subsection (C)5 of
this section shall apply.
         a.   Any person who commences any new impact generating land
development, except those exempted pursuant to this chapter, or those preparing
an individual assessment pursuant to this chapter, shall pay all development
impact fees applicable to the proposed development, as determined by the fee
table. Persons choosing to pay applicable development impact fees pursuant to
the fee table shall be deemed to have made a full and complete payment of the
project’s proportionate share of City capital facilities costs for system
improvements, except as noted in subsection
11-1-12(I) of this chapter.
         b.   If the proposed development is of a type not listed in the fee
table, then the City shall apply the development impact fees applicable to the
most nearly comparable type of land use listed in the fee table. The
determination as to which type of development is most nearly comparable to the
proposed development shall be made by referring to traffic generation rates for
land uses published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and by
identifying that land use listed in the fee table whose traffic generation
rates are most comparable to the proposed land use. If no traffic generation
rate for the proposed land use appears in a publication of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, or if it is not possible to determine which land use
listed in the fee table has the most comparable traffic generation rates, then
the most nearly comparable land use shall be determined by the Development
Impact Fee Administrator based on comparison of other characteristics of the
proposed land use (including employment or occupancy, the size of the facility,
and the amount of parking to be provided) with the characteristics of those
land uses listed in the fee table.
         c.   If the proposed development includes a mix of those uses listed
in the fee table, then the development impact fees shall be determined by
adding up the development impact fees that would be payable for each use as if
it were a freestanding use pursuant to the fee table. For example, development
impact fees for a church without ancillary facilities will be determined
through the process in subsection (C)3.b. of this section; but development
impact fees for a church with a daycare center shall be established by adding:
1) fees determined through the process in subsection (C)3.b. of this section
for the church itself, and 2) fees identified in the fee table for the daycare
portion of the facility.
         d.   If the fee payer requests that the city calculate the amount of
development impact fees due pursuant to the fee table, the city shall notify
the fee payer of such amount within thirty (30) days after receipt of that
request.
      4.   Using An Individual Assessment:
         a.   In lieu of calculating the amount(s) of development impact fees
by reference to the fee table, a fee payer may request that the amount of the
required development impact fee be determined through an individual assessment
for the proposed development. The individual assessment process shall permit
consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by
the fee payer to adjust the amount of the fee. If a fee payer requests the use
of an individual assessment, the fee payer shall be responsible for retaining a
qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment that complies with
the requirements of this chapter, at the fee payer’s expense. The fee payer
shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the
resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its proportionate
share of the cost of city capital improvements, based on the city’s adopted
levels of service, than the development impact fees that would otherwise be due
pursuant to the fee table. The city may hire a professional consultant to
review any independent impact fee calculation study on behalf of the city, and
may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
         b.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same level of
service standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the
development impact fee study, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost)
methodology, and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions
used.
         c.   An application for an individual assessment may be submitted at
any time that the number of dwelling units in the proposed development and the
types and amounts of development in each nonresidential category identified in
the fee table is known. The city shall issue a decision within thirty (30) days
following receipt of a completed application for individual assessment and
supporting information from the applicant, so as not to unreasonably delay
subsequent applications for or issuance of building permits.
         d.   Each individual assessment shall be submitted to the development
impact fee administrator or a designee, and may be accepted, rejected, or
accepted with modifications by the development impact fee administrator or a
designee as the basis for calculating development impact fees. The criteria for
acceptance, rejection, or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the
individual assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for the city capital
improvements element(s) created by the proposed development, or the costs of
those facilities, than the applicable fee shown in the fee table.
         e.   The decision by the development impact fee administrator or
designee on an application for an individual assessment shall include an
explanation of the calculation of the impact fee, shall specify the system
improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used, and shall
include an explanation of those factors identified in Idaho Code section 67-
8207.
         f.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the development impact fee administrator or a designee then
the development impact fees due under this chapter for such development shall
be calculated according to such individual assessment.
      5.   Extraordinary Impacts:
         a.   If the city determines that a proposed development generates
extraordinary impacts that will result in extraordinary costs, the city will
notify the fee payer of such determination within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a request for a certification pursuant to subsection D of this
section or a request for a building permit or development approval, whichever
occurs first. Such notice shall include a statement that the potential impacts
of such development on system improvements are not adequately addressed by the
development impact fee study, and that a supplemental study at the fee payer’s
expense will be required.
         b.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of extraordinary
impacts include, but are not limited to: 1) an indication that traffic
generation from the proposed development or activity will exceed those typical
for a facility or activity of its type, 2) an indication that employment
generated by the development or activity will exceed those typical for a
facility or activity of its type, 3) an indication the assumptions used in the
development impact fee study underestimate the level of activity or impact on
city capital facilities from the proposed development or activity, or 4) an
indication that levels of calls for law enforcement, fire, or emergency
services from developments or activities owned or operated by the fee payer or
its agents exceed the assumptions used in the development impact fee study.
         c.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a
development with extraordinary impacts, the city shall meet with the fee payer
to discuss whether the fee payer wants to: 1) pay for the supplemental study
necessary to determine the system improvement costs related to the proposed
development, or 2) modify the proposal to avoid generating extraordinary
impacts, or 3) withdraw the application for certification, building permit, or
development approval.
         d.   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study
required to document the proposed development’s proportionate share of system
improvement costs, then the city and the fee payer shall jointly select an
individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study, the fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the fee payer agrees to a longer time.
         e.   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to:
1) pay the proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the
supplemental study, or 2) modify the proposed development to reduce such costs,
or 3) withdraw the application. If the fee payer agrees to pay the system
improvement costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be
reduced to writing between the city and the fee payer prior to review and
consideration of any application for any development approval or building
permit related to the proposed development.
         f.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the
proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve development
that results in an extraordinary impact.
   (D)   Certification: After the development impact fees due for a proposed
development have been calculated pursuant to the fee table or the individual
assessment, the fee payer may request the development impact fee administrator
or a designee for a certification of the amount of development impact fees due
for that development. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the
development impact fee administrator or a designee shall issue a written
certification of the amount of development impact fees due for the proposed
development. Such certification shall establish the development impact fee so
long as there is no material change to the particular project as identified in
the individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule set forth in
the fee table. The certification shall include an explanation of the
calculation of the impact fee including an explanation of factors considered
under Idaho Code section 67-8207 and shall also specify the system improvement
(s) for which the development impact fee is intended to be used.
   (E)   Payment Of Fees:
      1.   All development impact fees due shall be paid to the city at the
following times:
         a.   If a building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time such permit is issued; or
         b.   If no building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time that construction commences; or
         c.   At such other time as the applicant and the city have agreed to
in writing, pursuant to applicable Idaho law.
      2.   All monies paid by a fee payer pursuant to the fee table shall be
identified as development impact fees and shall be promptly deposited in the
appropriate account(s) described in section
11-1-7 of this chapter.
      3.   A fee payer may pay a development impact fee under protest in order
to avoid delay in the issuance of a building permit or development approval. A
fee payer making a payment under protest shall not be estopped from exercising
the right of appeal provided in section
11-1-10 of this chapter, nor shall such fee payer be estopped from receiving a
refund of any amount deemed to have been illegally collected. (Ord. 2021-017,
10-11-2021)
11-1-6: SERVICE AREAS:
The following service areas are established for each development impact fee
element:
   (A)   The park impact fee service area shall include the entire city, and
park impact fees may be expended for park capital facilities located anywhere
in the city.
   (B)   The street impact fee service area shall include the entire city, and
street impact fees may be expended for street capital facilities located
anywhere in the city.
   (C)   The police impact fee service area shall include the entire city, and
police impact fees may be expended for police capital facilities located
anywhere in the city.
   (D)   The fire/EMS impact fee service area shall include the entire city,
and fire/EMS impact fees may be expended for fire/EMS capital facilities
located anywhere in the city. (Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-7: USE OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE FUNDS:
   (A)   Establishment Of Trust Fund And Accounts:
      1.   A development impact fee trust fund (the “trust fund”) is hereby
established for the purpose of ensuring that the development impact fees
collected pursuant to this chapter are used to address impacts reasonably
attributable to new development for which the development impact fees are paid.
      2.   The trust fund shall be divided into four (4) accounts: a police
capital facilities account, a fire/EMS capital facilities account a, parks and
recreation capital facilities account, and a street capital facilities account.
      3.   The development impact fee trust fund shall be maintained in an
interest bearing account. The interest earned on each account shall not be
governed by Idaho Code section 57-127, but shall be considered funds of the
account and shall be subject to the same restrictions on uses of funds as the
development impact fees on which the interest is generated.
      4.   Monies in each account shall be spent in the order collected, on a
first in/first out basis.
   (B)   Deposit And Management Of The Trust Fund:
      1.   All development impact fees collected by the city pursuant to this
chapter shall be promptly deposited into the appropriate account in the trust
fund.
      2.   The city shall maintain accounting records for each account.
      3.   As part of its annual audit process, the city shall prepare an
annual report: a) describing the amount of all development impact fees
collected, appropriated, or spent during the preceding year for each capital
improvements element and service area; and b) describing the percentage of
taxes and revenues from sources other than development impact fees collected,
appropriated or spent for system improvements during the preceding year by
capital improvements element and service area.
   (C)   Limitations On Expenditures Of Fees In Accounts:
      1.   Park And Recreation Impact Fee: The monies collected from the park
and recreation impact fee shall be used only to plan for, acquire, or construct
park and recreation capital facilities, or to pay debt service on any portion
of any future general obligation bond issue or revenue bond issue or similar
instrument used to finance the acquisition or construction of park capital
facilities within the city, or to reimburse the city for such costs.
      2.   Street Impact Fee: The monies collected from the street impact fee
shall be used only to plan for and acquire or construct street capital
facilities, or to pay debt service on any portion of any future general
obligation bond issue or revenue bond issue or similar instrument used to
finance the acquisition or construction of street capital facilities within the
city, or to reimburse the city for such costs.
      3.   Police Impact Fee: The monies collected from the police impact fee
shall be used only to plan for and acquire or construct police capital
facilities, or to pay debt service on any portion of any future general
obligation bond issue or revenue bond issue or similar instrument used to
finance the acquisition or construction of public safety capital facilities
within the city, or to reimburse the city for such costs.
      4.   Fire/EMS Impact Fee: The monies collected from the fire/EMS impact
fee shall be used only to plan for and acquire or construct fire/EMS capital
facilities, or to pay debt service on any portion of any future general
obligation bond issue or revenue bond issue or similar instrument used to

within the city, or to reimburse the city for such costs.
      5.   Development Impact Fees: Development impact fees shall not be used
to pay for any purpose that does not involve system improvements that create
additional service available to serve new growth and development. (Ord. 2021-
017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-8: REFUNDS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES PAID:
   (A)   Duty To Refund: Development impact fees shall be refunded to the fee
payer, or to a successor in interest, in the following circumstances:
      1.   Service is available but never provided;
      2.   A building permit, or permit for installation of a manufactured
home, is denied or abandoned;
      3.   The fee payer pays a development impact fee under protest and a
subsequent review of the fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment
determines that the fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which the
governmental entity was entitled to receive; or
      4.   The city has collected a development impact fee and has failed to
appropriate or expend the collected fees pursuant to subsection B of this
section.
   (B)   Failure To Encumber Trust Funds Or Commence Construction: Any
development impact fees paid shall be refunded if the city has failed to
commence construction of system improvements in accordance with this chapter,
or to appropriate funds for such construction, within eight (8) years after the
date on which such fee was paid. Any refund due shall be paid to the owner of
record of the parcel for which the development impact fees were paid. The city
may hold development impact fees for longer than eight (8) years if it
identifies in writing: 1) a reasonable cause why the fees should be held longer
than eight (8) years; and 2) an anticipated date by which the fees will be
expended, but in no event greater than eleven (11) years from the date they
were collected. If the city complies with the previous sentence, then any
development impact fees identified in such writing shall be refunded to the fee
payer if the city has failed to commence construction of system improvements in
accordance with this chapter, or to appropriate funds for such construction on
or before the date identified in such writing.
   (C)   No Refund Due:
      1.   Later Changes To Development: After a development impact fee has
been paid pursuant to this chapter and after a certificate of occupancy has
been issued, no refund of any part of such fee shall be made if the project for
which the fee was paid is later demolished, destroyed, or is altered,
reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to reduce the size of the project or the
number of units in the project.
   (D)   Interest: Each refund shall include a refund of interest at one-half
(½) the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date
on which the fee was originally paid.
   (E)   Timing: The city shall make a determination of whether a refund is due
within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request for a refund from
the owner of record of the property for which the fee was paid. When the right
to a refund exists, the city shall send the refund to the owner of record
within ninety (90) days after the city determines that a refund is due.
   (F)   Standing: Any person entitled to a refund shall have standing to sue
for a refund under the provisions of this chapter if there has not been a
timely payment of a refund pursuant to subsections A through E of this section.
(Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-9: CREDITS AGAINST DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
   (A)   Credits To Be Issued: When a developer, or their predecessor in title
or interest, has constructed system improvements of the same category as a city
capital improvements element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards
the completion of system improvements of the same category as a city capital
improvements element, and the city has accepted such construction,
contribution, or dedication, the city shall issue a credit against the
development impact fees otherwise due for the same city capital improvements
element in connection with the proposed development, as set forth in this
section. Credit shall be issued regardless of whether the contribution or
dedication to system improvements was required by the city as a condition of
development approval or was offered by the developer and accepted by the city
in writing, and regardless of whether the contribution or dedication was
contributed by the developer or by a local improvement district controlled by
the developer.
   (B)   Limitations: Credits against development impact fees shall not be
given for: 1) project improvements, or 2) any construction, contribution, or
dedication not agreed to in writing by the city prior to commencement of the
construction, contribution, or dedication. Credits issued for one city capital
improvements element may not be used to reduce development impact fees due for
a different capital improvements element. No credits shall be issued for system
improvements contributed or dedicated prior to the effective date hereof.
   (C)   Valuation Of Credit At Present Value:
      1.    Land: Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the fee
payer’s option, be valued at the present value of: a) one hundred percent
(100%) of the most recent assessed value for such land as shown in the records
of the county assessor, or b) that fair market value established by a private
appraiser acceptable to the city in an appraisal paid for by the fee payer. In
the event that city and the fee payer cannot agree upon an appraiser, either
may petition the district court for appointment of an appraiser.
      2.    Improvements: Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall be valued by the city at the present value of such
improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the fee payer to the city. The city
shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information submitted,
or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on
alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to the city as a more
accurate measure of the value of the offered system improvements to the city.
   (D)   When Credits Become Effective:
      1.    Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the city in a form acceptable to the city at no
cost to the city, and has been accepted by the city. When such conditions have
been met, the city shall note that fact in its records. Upon request of the fee
payer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
      2.    Approved credits for acquisition or construction of system
improvements shall generally become effective when: a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the city, b) a
suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the
city, and c) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the city and the state of Idaho. Approved credits for the
construction of system improvements may become effective at an earlier date if
the fee payer posts security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable
letter of credit, or escrow agreement and the amount and terms of such security
are accepted by the development impact fee administrator or a designee. At a
minimum, such security must be in the amount of the approved credit or an
amount determined to be adequate to allow the city to construct the system
improvements for which the credit was given, whichever is higher. When such
conditions have been met, the city shall note that fact in its records. Upon
request of the fee payer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of
credit available.
   (E)   Application Procedures:
      1.   In order to obtain a credit against development impact fees
otherwise due, a fee payer shall submit a written offer to dedicate to the
development impact fee administrator or a designee for specific parcels of
qualifying land or a written offer to contribute or construct specific system
improvements to the city capital facilities in accordance with all applicable
state or city design and construction standards, and shall specifically request
a credit against the type of development impact fees for which the land
dedication or system improvement is offered. No request for a credit against
development impact fees shall be accepted unless a written offer to dedicate,
contribute, or construct has previously been approved in writing by the city.
      2.   After receipt of the request for credit, the development impact fee
administrator or a designee shall review the request and determine whether the
land or system improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of
providing city capital facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of
the credit. If the development impact fee administrator or a designee
determines that the offered credit satisfies that criterion, then the credit
shall be issued. The city shall complete its review and determination of an
application for credit within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application
for credit.
   (F)   Transferability Of Credit: A credit may only be transferred by the fee
payer that has received the credit to a successor in interest pursuant to the
terms of this chapter. The credit may be used only to offset development impact
fees for the same city capital improvements element for which the credit was
issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly
identifying which credits issued under this chapter are being transferred, the
dollar amount of the credit being transferred, and the city capital
improvements element for which the credit was issued. The instrument of
transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee, and a copy of
the document shall be delivered to the development impact fee administrator or
a designee for documentation of the change in ownership before it shall become
effective.
   (G)   Accounting Of Credits: Each time a request to use approved credits is
presented to the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the development
impact fees for the type of fee for which the credit is provided, and shall
note in the city’s records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request
of the fee payer or successor in interest to whom the credit was issued, the
city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit remaining.
   (H)   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due: If the credit due to a fee payer
pursuant to subsections A through G of this section exceeds the development
impact fee that would otherwise be due from the fee payer pursuant to section
11-1-5 of this chapter (whether calculated through the fee table in section
11-1-5 of this chapter or through an independent assessment), the fee payer may
choose to receive such credit in the form of either: 1) a credit against future
development impact fees due for the same capital improvements element, or 2) a
reimbursement from development impact fees paid by future development that
impacts the system improvements contributed or dedicated by the fee payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the fee payer, the city shall be
under no obligation to use any city funds, other than development impact fees
paid by other development for the same city capital improvements element, to
reimburse the fee payer for any credit in excess of development impact fees
due.
   (I)   Written Agreement Required: If credit or reimbursement is due to the
fee payer pursuant to this section, the city shall enter into a written
agreement with the fee payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the system improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount,
time and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years. (Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-10: APPEALS AND MEDIATION:
Disputes regarding decisions made in the application of this chapter shall be
resolved through appeal to the city council, or through mediation, as set forth
below:
   (A)   Right To Appeal:
      1.   Any fee payer that is or may be obligated to pay a development
impact fee, or that claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, or
credit under this chapter, and who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the
development impact fee administrator or a designee in applying this chapter,
shall first request that the development impact fee administrator reconsider
the decision. A fee payer requesting reconsideration shall state in writing to
the development impact fee administrator the reasons why the fee payer believes
the decision to be in error. The development impact fee administrator shall
issue a written decision confirming or modifying the decision within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of a written request for reconsideration.
      2.   Any fee payer that is dissatisfied with the decision of the
development impact fee administrator upon reconsideration pursuant to
subsection A1 of this section, may appeal such decision to the city council.
The fee payer shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that the decision was in error.
      3.   In order to pursue the appeal described in subsection A2 of this
section, the fee payer shall file a written notice of the appeal with the
development impact fee administrator or a designee within thirty (30) days
after the date of the reconsideration, or the date on which the fee payer
submitted a payment of development impact fees under protest, whichever is
later. Such written application shall include a statement describing why the
fee payer believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any
documents that the fee payer believes support the claim.
      4.   The city council shall hear the appeal within sixty (60) days after
receipt of a written notice of appeal. The fee payer shall have a right to be
present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The development
impact fee administrator or designee who made the decision under appeal shall
likewise have the right to be present and to present evidence in support of the
decision. The criteria to be used by the city council in considering the appeal
shall be whether: a) the decision or interpretation made by the development
impact fee administrator after reconsideration, or b) the alternative decision
or interpretation offered by the fee payer more accurately reflects the
proportionate share of the costs of system improvements to city capital
facilities necessary to serve new development and whether this chapter has been
correctly applied. The city council shall issue a decision upholding,
reversing, or modifying the decision being appealed within thirty (30) days
after hearing the appeal.
   (B)   Mediation:
      1.   Any fee payer that has a disagreement with the city regarding a
development impact fee that is or may be due for a proposed development
pursuant to this chapter, may enter into a voluntary agreement with the city to
subject the disagreement to mediation by a qualified independent party
acceptable to both the fee payer and the city.
      2.   Mediation may take place at any time following the filing of a
timely appeal pursuant to this section, or as an alternative to such appeal,
provided that the request for mediation is filed no later than the last date on
which a timely appeal could be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section.
      3.   Participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies provided for in subsection A of this section.
      4.   If mediation is requested, any related mediation costs shall be
shared equally by the fee payer and the city, and a written agreement regarding
the payment of such costs shall be executed prior to the commencement of
mediation.
      5.   In the event that mediation does not resolve the issues between the
parties, the fee payer retains all rights to seek relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-11: ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION:
When any development impact fee is due pursuant to the terms of this chapter,
or pursuant to the terms of any written agreement between a fee payer and the
city authorized by this chapter, and such fee has not been paid in a timely
manner, the city may exercise any or all of the following powers, in any
combination, to enforce the collection of the fee:
   (A)   The city may withhold building permits or other development approvals
related to the development for which the fee is due until all development
impact fees due have been paid.
   (B)   The city may withhold utility services from the development for which
the fee is due until all development impact fees due have been paid.
   (C)   The city may add to the amount of the fee interest at the legal rate
provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date on which the fee was
due.
   (D)   The city may impose liens for failure to timely pay a development
impact fee following procedures contained in chapter 5, title 45, Idaho Code.
(Ord. 2021-017, 10-11-2021)
11-1-12: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any additional
right to develop real property or diminish the power of the city in regulating
the orderly development of real property.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve any
development request that may reasonably be expected to reduce levels of service
below minimum acceptable levels established in the development impact fee
study.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict or diminish the power of the
city: 1) to impose reasonable conditions on the annexation of any property to
the city in accordance with Idaho Code, including conditions for recovery of
project or system improvement costs required as a result of such voluntary
annexation, or 2) to negotiate and execute development agreements that may
impose additional conditions on development, including the recovery of project
or system improvement costs, either in connection with a proposed annexation or
in connection with any other development within the city.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a
project for which a complete application for a building permit has been
received by the city prior to the effective date hereof shall not be subject to
the development impact fees imposed by this chapter. If the resulting building
permit is later revised or replaced after the effective date hereof, and the
new building permit reflects a development density, intensity, or number of
units more than ten percent (10%) higher than that reflected in the original
building permit, then development impact fees may be charged on the difference
in density, intensity, or number of units between the original and the revised
or replacement building permit.
   (E)   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the city from requiring fee
payer or an applicant for a development approval or building permit to
construct reasonable project improvements required to serve the applicant’s
project, provided that such request does not duplicate a system improvement in
a category for which costs were included in the development impact fee study.
   (F)   Any monies, including any accrued interest not assigned to specific
system improvements within such capital improvements program and not expended
pursuant to section
11-1-7 of this chapter or refunded pursuant to section
11-1-8 of this chapter shall be retained in the same account until the next
fiscal year.
   (G)   The city shall be entitled to collect and retain a surcharge on each
development impact fee collected in order to recoup that portion of the cost of
preparing the capital improvements plan that is attributable to determining the
development impact. Such surcharge does not exceed each development’s
proportionate share of the cost of preparing the plan.
   (H)   If the city discovers an error in the development impact fee study
that results in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share of
system improvement costs on any proposed development, the city shall: 1) adjust
the development impact fee to collect no more than a proportionate share or 2)
discontinue the collection of any development impact fees until the error is
corrected by ordinance.
   (I)   If development impact fees are calculated and paid based on a mistake
or misrepresentation, they shall be recalculated. Any amounts overpaid by a fee
payer shall be refunded by the city within thirty (30) days after the City’s
acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the legal rate provided
for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date on which the fee was paid.
Any amounts underpaid by the fee payer shall be paid to the City within thirty
(30) days after the City’s acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest
at the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date on
which the fee was paid. In the case of an underpayment to the City, the City
may withhold issuance of building permits or development approvals for the
project for which the development impact fee was paid until such underpayment
is corrected, and if amounts owed to the City are not paid within such thirty

fee and refund such fee to the fee payer.
   (J)   The City Council shall consider the Development Impact Fee Advisory
Committee’s recommended revision(s) to this chapter at least once every twelve
(12) months. The committee’s recommendations and the City Council’s actions are
intended to ensure that the benefits to a fee paying development are equitable,
in that the fee charged to the development shall not exceed a proportionate
share of the costs of system improvements, and the procedures for administering
development impact fees remain efficient.
   (K)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit
private agreements between developers, the City, the Idaho Transportation
Department, and/or other governmental entities in regard to the construction or
installation of system improvements or providing for credits or reimbursements
for system improvement costs incurred by a developer or fee payer, including
interproject transfers of credits, or providing for reimbursement for project
improvements that are used or shared by more than one development project. If
it can be shown that a proposed development has a direct impact on a public
facility under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Transportation Department, then
the agreement shall include a provision for the allocation of development
impact fees collected from the developer or fee payer for the improvement of
the public facility by the Idaho Transportation Department.
