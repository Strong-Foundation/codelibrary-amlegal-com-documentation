Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:
 
17.40.032: HILLSIDE PROVISIONS:
A. The provisions of this section shall apply to any building site where the
topographic slope of said building site exceeds fifteen percent (15%) grade.
B. Cut and fill slopes shall comply with the following development standards:
1. Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material, such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material which is determined by the soils
engineer to be detrimental to proper compaction or otherwise not conducive to
stability; no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension
greater than eight inches (8") shall be used as fill material in fills that are
intended to provide structural strength.
2. Fills shall be compacted to at least ninety five percent (95%) of maximum
density, as determined by AASHO T99 and ASTM D698.
3. Cut slopes shall be no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one vertical;
subsurface drainage shall be provided as necessary for stability.
4. Fill slopes shall be no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one vertical;
fill slopes shall not be located on natural slopes two to one (2:1) or steeper,
or where fill slope toes out within twelve feet (12') horizontally of the top
of an existing or planned cut slope.
5. Tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from property
boundaries a distance of three feet (3') plus one-fifth (1/5) of the height of
the cut or fill, but need not exceed a horizontal distance of ten feet (10');
tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from structures a
distance of six feet (6') plus one-fifth (1/5) the height of the cut or fill,
but need not exceed ten feet (10').
6. The maximum horizontal distance of disturbed soil surface shall not exceed
seventy five feet (75').
7. All cut and fill slopes shall be revegetated and/or rehabilitated with
retaining walls to eliminate unsightly hillside scarring and erosion. In those
instances when it is necessary to disturb naturally vegetated slopes during
construction of dwellings and other associated improvements, the disturbed
slope areas shall be repaired and revegetated. Temporary or permanent watering
systems shall be installed and maintained during revegetation to ensure
adequate growth on revegetated existing or new cut and fill slope areas.
Revegetation shall consist of drought tolerant ground cover plantings, dry land
grasses, shrubs, and trees combined with rock groupings, retaining walls or
other similar designs or methods to prevent soil erosion and unsightly views.
Plants and materials used in the revegetation shall not be of a type or variety
to cause an environmental threat or concern to the local or forest environment
and shall not include any plants listed as noxious weeds by Custer County.
C. Revegetation as defined in subsection B for all cut and fill slopes shall be
completed no later than twelve (12) months from the expiration date of the
building permit or within twelve (12) months of building completion, whichever
is earlier.
D. Retaining walls are limited to eight feet (8') in height above finished
grade of retaining wall unless otherwise approved by the city council. For
areas or slopes exceeding eight feet (8') in height above the finished grade,
or as required by engineering or other circumstances, stair stepped or offset
retaining walls shall be constructed. Unless approved otherwise by the city
council, the horizontal distance between the stepped or offset wall shall not
be less than one-half (1/2) the retaining wall height. Retaining walls shall be
constructed of durable or permanent materials, which are attractive earth tone
or natural material, or otherwise screened. Types of approved retaining wall
materials include keystone block, large rock, natural rustic wood, railroad
ties or other similar natural material. A "retaining wall" shall be defined as
a structure built of approved materials, whose purpose shall be to stabilize
existing or manufactured slopes for both the prevention of erosion and the
creation of a building site. A retaining wall, which is in an integral part of
a building's structural design, and is attached to the building shall be
considered as part of that building's "viewable facade", with the provision
that its total length does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the length of the
main building, and therefore not subject to the eight foot (8') height
limitation.
E. No building shall have a viewable facade that exceeds twenty eight feet
(28') in height, unless a daylight basement is approved by the City Council, in
which case the viewable facade as viewed from no more than three (3) sides
shall not exceed thirty eight feet (38') in height. A "daylight basement" shall
exist when at least one side of the basement level is totally or partially
excavated or backfilled into a hillside, and at least two (2) other sides
significantly excavated or backfilled into a hillside. At least one side must
have a viewable facade of no more than twenty-eight feet (28') in height. The
"viewable facade" of a structure shall be defined as the total visible portion
of that structure from any particular side, from lowest point to rooftop.
F. Construction of dwellings and associated improvements should take into
consideration the need for erosion control facilities and techniques during and
after construction. Silt fences, straw bales, berms and ditches are examples of
temporary techniques to control erosion. Under no circumstances shall
uncontrolled erosion be allowed to deposit eroded materials on any adjacent
lot, roadway, stream or wetland area. Existing or new cut and fill slopes
should be protected from erosion potential. Permanent erosion control
facilities should be incorporated in the design of the dwelling, lot grading,
landscaping and other improvements.
G. Building permit holders shall be notified by the City at least thirty (30)
days prior to a permit expiration date. Any person not completing the work
described in a valid building permit by the termination date on the permit and
who has not applied for a successor building permit shall be fined fifty
dollars ($50.00) per month until a successor building permit is approved. In
addition, the incomplete construction may be declared a public nuisance. Any
person violating any other provision of this section shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to such penalties as
provided by law.

including holidays. In other areas, routine maintenance may be conducted at any
time. Emergency repairs and maintenance shall be conducted only in the cases of
power outages and equipment failure or malfunction. Equipment "change out" and
overhaul may occur any time with thirty (30) days' notice to the city to allow
notice to property owners and residents within one hundred feet (100') of the
facility, if applicable.
4.   Monitoring: At five (5) year intervals from the date when the city issues
any permit authorized by this chapter, the applicant shall submit the following
information, in writing, to the city council:
         a.   Confirmation that the facility continues to operate in compliance
with all terms and conditions of approval by the city.
         b.   Independent field strength or power density measurements taken
within the past thirty (30) days that verify that the facility continues to
operate in compliance with all terms and conditions and emissions standards
imposed by the federal communications commission.
         c.   An evaluation of available equipment that would enhance the
safety, efficiency or visibility of the facility or reduce the size of the
facility.
         d.   An evaluation of available alternate locations for a potentially
more appropriate alternative.
         e.   Confirmation that the facility continues to function as an
essential element of the applicant's network.
         f.   Documentation of any complaints received by the applicant since
the inception of operations regarding the operation and maintenance of the
facility, including the application actions to address the complaints.
D. Construction Time, Abandonment, And Decommissioning: All wireless
communication facilities which receive a permit under this chapter shall be
completed and operational within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the
issuance of the permit and all related permits or licenses. The construction
time may be extended for an additional one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
upon a showing of good faith efforts to complete the facility, which shall take
into account complications beyond the control of the applicant including season
considerations. If the facility is not completed and operational by the end of
the extension period, then the permit shall expire, and the applicant must
reapply for the permit; however, this provision shall not apply when the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city council that the
operational delay is due entirely to factors beyond the control of the
applicant, in which event the council may extend the construction time at their
discretion. Any facility that ceases operating for more than ninety (90)
consecutive days shall be considered abandoned. In such an event, the applicant
must either: 1) apply for all permits required at the time of expiration to
reactivate the operation, or 2) remove all elements of the facility and restore
the site, as negotiated in the lease contract. In the event the applicant fails
to comply with permits or perform the removal and restoration within these
ninety (90) days, the property owner may seek another applicant for use of the
facility within one hundred eighty (180) days or shall have the facility
removed.

promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of
Stanley.
      2.   The flood hazard areas of Stanley are subject to periodic inundation
which results in potential loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      3.   These flood losses are caused by the occupancy of flood hazard areas
by uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage.
      4.   The cumulative effects of obstructions in special flood hazard areas
increase flood heights and velocities, exacerbating the potential for flood
damage in areas vulnerable to floods.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose:
      1.   Promote and protect public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   Minimize the expense and inconvenience to property owners and the
general public from flood disruptions.
      3.   Minimize prolonged business disruptions.
      4.   Promote the availability of flood insurance.
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally incurred at public expense.
      6.   Ensure that potential property owners are aware when property is in
an area of special flood hazard.
      7.   Ensure that those who occupy special flood hazard areas are aware of
the risks of potential flooding.
      8.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard.
      9.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas.
      10.   Preserve and protect the natural characteristics of watercourses
and natural protective barriers that help disperse floodwaters.
      11.   Ensure that development or disturbance in one area of flood hazard
does not substantially impact in an adverse way property owners in upstream or
downstream flood hazard areas, or in adjacent flood hazard areas.
      12.   Provide for a formal review and permitting procedure for proposed
developments and other developments in the floodplain or floodway, and criteria
for flood hazard mitigation as a condition of permitting.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters.
      4.   Controlling, filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage.
      5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure of five hundred (500) square feet or less that
is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal structure, and is not used for human
habitation. Includes detached garages, storage sheds, gazebos, picnic
pavilions, boathouses, small pole barns, hot springs bathhouses, and similar
buildings.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the administrator's interpretation of any
provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: Land in the floodplain within a community subject
to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year (100-year
floodplain). Designation always includes letters A, AE or V on flood insurance
rate maps. Also known as special flood hazard area (SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: A flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (100-year flood).
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION: The water surface elevation during the base flood in
relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation (BFE) is depicted on
the FIRM to the nearest foot and in the FIS to the nearest 0.1 foot.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building including crawl space having its floor
subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FACILITY: A facility that is critical for the health and welfare of
the population and is especially important following hazard events. Critical
facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals,
police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations that
produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
has been the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical
datum currently adopted by the federal government as a basis for measuring
heights is the North American vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPER: The person or legal entity making application for a development
permit for a proposed development.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings, structures or accessory structures,
bridges, roads, the placement of mobile homes, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, and the placement or
extraction of materials, specifically including the construction of dikes,
berms, and levees, or storage of equipment or materials located within the area
of special flood hazard.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor
raised above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and which is anchored so as
not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the
magnitude of the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated
building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The official form (FEMA form 81-31 or its successors)
used to provide information on the lowest floor elevation of a building
necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances,
and determine the proper insurance premium rate with section B, to be completed
and signed by the appropriate community officials and professionals according
to current FEMA guidelines.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced before the adoption of this chapter.
FEMA: Federal emergency management agency.
FLOOD FRINGE: The area between the regulatory floodway and the base floodplain
boundary. Flood fringe areas are lands adjacent to rivers or streams that are
"outside" of the floodway, but are subject to recurring inundation from a base
flood.
FLOOD HAZARD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: A permit that must be approved by the
floodplain program administrator before development may occur, including
substantial improvements, or other encroachments within the area of special
flood hazard.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
insurance administration has delineated the areas of special flood hazards,
including floodplains and floodways as applicable, and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.

administration has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries, as well as the
flood insurance rate map(s) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that corresponds to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance annual flood (base flood), plus any
increase in flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any additional
amount of freeboard specified by the regulating entity. In the city of Stanley,
the flood protection elevation shall be the base flood elevation plus two feet
(2').
FLOOD RESISTANT MATERIALS: Any building material capable of withstanding direct
and prolonged contact without sustaining significant damage. Prolonged contact
means at least seventy two (72) hours, and significant damage means any damage
requiring more than low cost cosmetic repair (such as painting).
FLOODPLAIN: The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the
regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR: A person or entity designated by the city
council to administer this chapter.
FLOODPROOFING: Protection measures made to a building that is not elevated
above the flood level to ensure that floodwaters do not damage it. Dry
floodproofing consists of ensuring that the walls and floor are watertight and
capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressures and hydrodynamic forces. Wet
floodproofing permits water to enter the building and seek its own level to
alleviate hydrostatic pressure.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge and store the floodwater
or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. Refer to the
elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for highest adjacent grade related to
building elevation information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of the interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
1. By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior;
or
2. Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
HYDRAULICS: The study of moving water. A hydraulic analysis calculates how high
and how fast a flood discharge flows.
HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE: The pressure that standing water places on the walls and
floor of a structure.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
   A.   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): A letter to correct inadvertent
inclusion of land within a special flood hazard area (SFHA). LOMAs usually are
issued when properties have been inadvertently mapped as being within the
floodplain, but are actually on natural high ground above the SFHA. Because an
LOMA officially amends the effective NFIP map, it is a public record that the
community must maintain. Any LOMA should be noted on the community's master
flood map and filed by panel number in an accessible location.
   B.   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
showing changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations and planimetric features. LOMRs are generally based on physical
changes to the floodplain, or more accurate survey information on the SFHA. One
common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination that a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is excluded from
the special flood hazard area. Because an LOMR officially revises the effective
NFIP map, it is a public record that the community must maintain. Any LOMR
should be noted on the community's master flood map and filed by panel number
in an accessible location.
   C.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum national
flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway
maps, or flood insurance studies.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE: The lowest elevation of the ground surface adjacent to
the foundation or walls of a structure. Refer to the elevation certificate,
FEMA form 81-31, for lowest adjacent grade related to building elevation
information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the parking of vehicles,
building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a
building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so to render
the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements
of this chapter found in subsection 15.08.050B1c of this chapter (provided
there are adequate flood ventilation openings). The lowest floor is a
determinate for the flood insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or
contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots
for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date hereof. Includes substantial improvements
subsequent to the date of this chapter.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A manufactured
home park or manufactured home subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by the city.
NEW SUBDIVISION: A subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots (including, at minimum, the installation of utilities,
construction of streets, and final site grading) is completed on or after the
effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
NONRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE: A structure not designed to be used as a dwelling,
and not including living quarters, except for hotels, boarding houses, lodging
houses. Includes commercial, industrial, and accessory structures.
PREMISES: Land and all the buildings on it.
REAL ESTATE: Property consisting of land and attached buildings.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis,
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known
to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular
stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based
upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed
or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In
inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one
hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent
(1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be preserved in order to discharge and store the
floodwaters associated with the regulatory flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE: A structure containing living quarters designed to be
used as a dwelling, including single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings,
apartments, and condominiums, but not including hotels, boarding houses, and
lodging houses.
RETAINING WALL: A structure built of approved materials, whose purpose is to
stabilize existing or manufactured slopes for both the prevention of erosion
and the creation of a building site.
SECTION 404 PERMIT: A permit required by section 404 of the clean water act to
regulate the discharge into waters of the United States, including filling,
soil movement, and the placement of certain pilings in wetlands to ensure that
such discharges comply with environmental requirements.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has
been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map,
zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30,
AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these
regulations, the term "area of special flood hazard" is synonymous in meaning
with the phrase "special flood hazard area (SFHA)".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvements and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site
such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas or
liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground.
SUBDIVISION: A portion of land divided into lots.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its condition prior to the damage would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of
the structure should be: a) the appraised value of the structure prior to the
start of the initial repair or improvement, or b) in the case of damage, the
value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. Substantial improvement
occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief in part or in whole from the requirements of this
chapter that permits construction or improvements to a property that would
otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
WATERCOURSE: A channel that carries a naturally flowing permanent or
intermittent stream of water of any size. (Ord. 182, 5-13-2010)
15.08.030: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands And Activities To Which This Chapter Applies: The provisions of
this chapter shall apply to all developments in special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the city of Stanley, Custer County, Idaho.
   B.   Basis For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard for the city of Stanley identified in a scientific and
engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study, Custer County, Idaho And
Incorporated Areas", dated March 4, 1988, with an accompanying flood insurance
rate map (FIRM), are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter. These documents were prepared by FEMA as part of the national
flood insurance program. These documents are on file at the offices of the city
of Stanley, Idaho, P.O. Box 53, Stanley, ID 83278. In addition, the best
available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in
subsection 15.08.040B1d of this chapter shall be the basis for regulation until
a new FIRM, letter of map amendment, or letter of map revision is issued by
FEMA that incorporates data utilized under subsection 15.08.040B1d of this
chapter. Maps depicting the best available information used as the basis for
regulation, including engineering studies submitted as required in subsection
15.08.040B1d of this chapter, will be on file at the offices of the city of
Stanley, Idaho, P.O. Box 53, Stanley, ID 83278.
   C.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and other ordinances, easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   D.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   E.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Stanley, any
officer or employee thereof or the United States department of housing and
urban development, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 182, 5-13-2010)
15.08.040: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of The Local Flood Damage Program Administrator: The city
of Stanley floodplain program administrator will administer this chapter by
approving or denying flood hazard development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions.
   B.   Flood Hazard Development Permitting Procedures: A development permit
shall be obtained before any construction or development begins within any area
of special flood hazard established in subsection 15.08.030B of this chapter.
The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, as set
forth in the "definitions", and for all development including fill and other
activities, also as set forth in the "definitions".
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or alteration of any structure or
development, including all such changes to conforming and nonconforming
developments that existed prior to the adoption of this chapter, also must
obtain a flood hazard development permit. Application for a flood hazard
development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain program
administrator. In order to complete a permit, information is required during
the application and construction stages.
      1.   Application Stage: Applications for new development and substantial
improvements shall include:
         a.   Plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing:
            (1)   The existing contours with intervals of one foot (1') or less
of the elevation of the entire property.
            (2)   The proposed contours with intervals of one foot (1') or less
of the elevation of the entire property.
            (3)   The location, dimensions and elevations (measured from mean
sea level) of the proposed improvements, including buildings, structures, fill,
drainage facilities, driveways, and streets.
            (4)   For subdivision proposals, the preliminary plat shall depict
the special flood hazard area.
         b.   The location of existing watercourses, canals, ditches, springs
and culverts.
         c.   Elevation in relation to the flood protection elevation vertical
datum identified on the effective FIRM of the lowest floor (including basement
or crawl space) of all structures, or identified by other flood protection
elevation data as provided under subsection B1d of this section.
         d.   Base flood elevation, and floodway data, either from the most
current FIS and FIRM, or available from a federal, state or other source, or if
those data are not available, then developed independently by the applicant
through analysis by a registered professional engineer.
         e.   If base flood and floodway data are from other than a current
FIRM, and are less restrictive than the current FIRM, the information shall be
submitted to FEMA to obtain a letter of map change before construction occurs
under a flood hazard development permit.
         f.   Elevation to which any nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed.
         g.   Certification by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing
criteria in subsection 15.08.050B2 of this chapter.
         h.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
         i.   Description of mitigation or maintenance activities within the
altered or relocated portion of all altered or relocated watercourses and
certification by a registered professional engineer that the flood carrying
capacity is not diminished.
         j.   Copies of all required federal and state permits, including
studies and mitigation plans for wetlands (e.g., section 404 permits).
         k.   The administrator may require additional information if necessary
to determine impacts to special flood hazard areas or to ensure that the
development mitigates such impacts.
      2.   Construction Stage:
         a.   For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the floodplain program administrator an as built
certification of the floor elevation or floodproofing level, using appropriate
FEMA elevation or floodproofing certificate, immediately after the lowest floor
or floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for
nonresidential structures, the certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same.
         b.   Deficiencies identified by the floodplain program administrator
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to work
proceeding. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the corrections
shall be cause for the floodplain program administrator to issue a stop work
order for the project. Stop work orders shall only be issued after review and
approval by the city council.
      3.   Expiration Of Floodplain Development Permit: All floodplain
development permits shall be conditional upon the commencement of work within
one hundred eighty (180) days. A floodplain development permit shall expire one
hundred eighty (180) days after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and thereafter is pursued to completion.
   C.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Administrator: Duties of the
floodplain program administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter, including all the data required in subsection B
of this section have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from applicable federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required by federal or state law,
including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act amendments of
1972, 33 USC 1334; the endangered species act of 1973, 16 USC 1531-1544; and
state of Idaho stream channel alteration permits. Idaho Code 42 chapter 38
requires that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file.
However, the administrator's review in no way alters the responsibility of the
developer to obtain all necessary permits.
      3.   Notify adjacent communities and the appropriate state and federal
agencies prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification and subsequent regulatory approval to the federal
insurance administration and to the city of Stanley.
      4.   Require that the developer provide maintenance within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse per standards set by federal and state
regulatory agencies so the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
      5.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If the development is located in a
floodway, ensure that the provisions of subsection 15.08.050D of this chapter
are met.
      6.   When base flood elevation and floodway data have not been provided
in accordance with subsection
15.08.030B of this chapter (in A zones) by a flood insurance study, the
floodplain program administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or
other source, in order to administer subsections
15.08.050B, "Specific Standards", and
15.08.050D, "Floodways", of this chapter.
      7.   Where interpretation is needed of the exact location of boundaries
of the areas of special flood hazard including regulatory floodway (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions), the floodplain program administrator shall make the
interpretation. Interpretations made pursuant to this section may or may not
require certification of a registered professional engineer, at the discretion
of the administrator. Any significant discrepancies between apparent boundaries
based on existing conditions and previously certified mapped boundaries should
be addressed through a letter of map revision or letter of map amendment to
produce an updated and accurate flood insurance rate map. Any person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided by section 15.08.080 of this chapter.
      8.   Obtain, verify and record the actual elevation in relation to the
vertical datum on the effective FIRM, or highest adjacent grade, of the lowest
floor level, including basement, of all new construction or substantially
improved structures.
      9.   Obtain, verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to the
vertical datum on the effective FIRM to which any new or substantially improved
structures have been floodproofed.
      10.   When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the floodplain
administrator shall obtain certification of design criteria from a registered
professional engineer or architect.
      11.   If base flood and floodway data are from other than a current FIRM,
and are more restrictive than the current FIRM, the floodplain administrator
shall submit the data to FEMA to obtain a letter of map change.

15.08.050: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
standards are required:
      1.   Developments Outside The Floodway:
         a.   Developments, including fill, new construction and substantial
improvements, shall require certification from a registered professional
engineer that such developments shall not result in an increase in base flood
elevations greater than one foot (1').
         b.   The cumulative impacts of such proposed developments when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within
the floodplain within the city of Stanley community.
         c.   For the purposes of administering this subsection, anticipated
development shall mean only developments for which an application or
applications are currently under review for permit approval by the
administrator. The administrator shall collect and separately maintain records
for pending and approved developments within the floodplain areas and make such
records available for use by the applicants for use in performing the one foot
(1') rise analysis.
         d.   Applicants for proposed projects that increased the base flood
elevation more than a foot shall obtain from FEMA a conditional letter of map
revision before the project may be permitted.
         e.   Engineering certification as described in subsection A1a of this
section shall not be required for substantial improvements to structures that
have suffered substantial damage if the substantial improvement is a
reconstruction of a structure previously certified as required in subsection
A1a of this section, without any significant changes in structural design.
      2.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored on pilings, columns, or foundation walls oriented to the axis
of the flow path to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure. Such supports shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer as capable of withstanding all applied loads of the base flood, with a
reasonable margin of safety.
         b.   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and
practices that minimize flood damage. Methods of anchoring may include, but are
not to be limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
      3.   AH Zone Drainage: Adequate drainage paths are required around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      4.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be elevated to or
above the flood protection elevation or be floodproofed so that floodwaters
cannot enter and accumulate within the system components during a flood.
      5.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         b.   Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the
floodway, and comply with setbacks from the floodway as required by the Idaho
department of environmental quality.
         c.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
         d.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
         e.   Buried utility transmission lines transporting hazardous
substances (e.g., electrical, gas) that are located in a floodway shall be
buried at a minimum depth of four feet (4') below the maximum depth of scour
for the base flood, as predicted by a registered professional engineer.
      6.   Subdivision Standards:
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
         b.   All subdivision preliminary plats/development plans shall include
the mapped flood hazard zones from the effective FIRM.
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
         d.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage.
         e.   Approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats shall be
conditioned upon compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter,
and upon demonstration that potential future development of lots and structures
upon such lots can potentially comply with all of the requirements of this
chapter.
         f.   All new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for new manufactured home parks and manufactured home
subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the
lesser, shall include within such proposals flood protection elevation data.
      7.   Fill:
         a.   Fill shall be placed using good engineering practices to ensure
that it is reasonably safe from flooding. Fill areas may be protected by
retaining walls, pursuant to subsection A1 of this section. The height of
retaining walls shall not exceed the height of the fill. Retaining walls shall
be constructed of durable or permanent materials, which are attractive earth
tone or natural colored material, and screened to blend with the floodplain
vegetation. Retaining walls shall be constructed and reinforced according to
the preengineered design standards and for the retaining wall system used or,
if not preengineered, shall require some reinforcement for walls above two feet
(2') in height and, if greater than four feet (4') in height, shall require
structural design parameters capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy, as certified by a registered professional
engineer. Retaining walls may not be built in areas that have not been filled.
      8.   Preexisting Nonconforming Developments: A development that predates
the adoption of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
         a.   No such use or structure shall be expanded, enlarged, or altered
in any way which increases its nonconformity unless a flood hazard development
permit variance is approved.
         b.   If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
         c.   Uses which are or become nuisances as defined in title 8 of this
code shall not be permitted to continue as nonconforming uses.
         d.   Owners of properties with nonconforming structures or other
developments may be required to mitigate the off property erosion and
channelization impacts of changes in floodways that can be directly attributed
to the nonconforming use of such structures or developments.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation data have been provided as set forth in subsection 15.08.030B, "Basis
For Establishing Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", or in subsection 15.08.040B1d
of this chapter, use of other and floodway data, the following standards are
required for all development:
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements, including a
structure that has been substantially damaged, shall be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage and constructed using methods and practices
that minimize flood damage.
         b.   The lowest floor, including basement, of new construction or
substantial improvement of any structure shall be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation.
         c.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor such as crawl spaces,
vehicle parking areas, building access, and storage areas, that are subject to
flooding during the base flood, are prohibited unless designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and
exit of floodwaters. Designs for automatically equalizing hydrostatic forces on
exterior walls during floods must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet the following criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. Standard foundation vents as required by the international
building code do not meet this standard.
            (4)   Crawl spaces below the lowest adjacent grade (LAG) are
prohibited at sites where the velocity of floodwaters exceeds five feet (5')
per second.
            (5)   The interior grade of a crawl space below the base flood
elevation must not be more than two feet (2') below the LAG and the height of
the below grade crawl space measured from the interior grade of the crawl space
to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed four feet (4') at
any point.
            (6)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within seventy two (72)
hours after floodwaters are no longer entering the crawl space.
            (7)   Crawl spaces below the LAG constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
            (8)   Unfinished or flood resistant enclosures below the LAG shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment,
or building access.
            (9)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
         d.   Any chemicals or other toxic materials that could cause
contamination of surface waters or groundwater, or that could be injurious to
public health, safety, and welfare shall be located at or above the flood
protection elevation and stored in a manner that prevents their release in the
event of a flood.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction or the substantial
improvement of any nonresidential structure located in zones A1-30, AE, or AH
must be floodproofed if the new construction or improvement is not elevated.
The structure and attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be designated
to be watertight to the flood protection elevation with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect must certify that the
design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting these provisions, and shall provide certification to the
floodplain program administrator.
      3.   Accessory Structures: Accessory structures as defined in section
15.08.020 of this chapter shall comply with all provisions of subsection A,
"General Standards", of this section and this subsection B, except for
subsections B1b and B2 of this section.
      4.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved in special flood hazard areas shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated to or above the flood protection elevation and must meet the
requirements of subsection A, "General Standards", of this section and this
subsection B.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreation vehicles placed within flood
hazard areas are required to:
         a.   Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days, and
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking
system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and have no permanently attached additions, or
         c.   The recreation vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new
construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements.
      6.   Critical Facilities: Construction of new critical facilities shall
be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of special flood hazard
areas. Construction of such facilities shall be permissible within an SFHA if
no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed
within SFHAs shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet (3') above the FPE
or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. The applicant
shall be responsible for determining, with certification by a registered
professional engineer, the height of the 500-year flood. Access routes to and
from such facilities also shall be protected to the elevation standard of the
facility, to the extent feasible. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters.
   C.   Special Flood Hazard Areas With Base Flood Elevations But No Designated
Regulatory Floodways:
      1.   In SFHAs with base flood elevations, but where a regulatory floodway
has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE
on a community's FIRM unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase water surface of the base flood more than one
foot (1') at any point within the floodplain within the city of Stanley.
      2.   For the purposes of administering this subsection, anticipated
development shall mean only developments for which an application or
applications are currently under review for permit approval by the
administrator. The administrator shall collect and separately maintain records
for pending and approved developments within the floodplain areas without
mapped floodway boundaries and make such records available for use by the
applicants for use in performing the one foot (1') rise analysis.
      3.   Applicants for proposed projects that increased the base flood
elevation more than a foot shall obtain from FEMA a conditional letter of map
revision before the project may be permitted.
   D.   Floodways: Since the floodway comprises the main channel of a
watercourse during a flood, it is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential.
      1.   All development, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments are prohibited unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed development will not result in any increase in flood
levels within the floodplain within the city of Stanley during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection D1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
provisions of this section.
      3.   Floodway bridge construction standards found in the Idaho
transportation department (ITD) "Bridge Design LRFD Manual" and the ITD
"Roadway Design Manual" are adopted by reference, unless they conflict with
other provisions of this chapter.
   E.   Requirement To Submit New Technical Data:
      1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts;
      2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or
letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for
these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. 182, 5-
13-2010)
15.08.060: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, expanded, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one
hundred eighty (180) days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day or portion thereof
during which any work performed in violation of the provisions of this chapter
continues in existence shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of
this chapter. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Stanley from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 182, 5-13-2010)
15.08.070: VARIANCE PROCEDURE:
   A.   Application For Variance: A variance from the terms of this chapter
shall not be considered until a written application for a variance containing
the information required for a flood hazard development permit and the
information in subsection
15.08.040B of this chapter is filed with the administrator for submission to
the city council. In judging and acting upon variance applications, the city
council, shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The potential danger, that materials may be swept onto other lands
possibly resulting in the injury of others;
      2.   The potential danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents, if
any, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services and benefits of proposed commercial
and residential developments to the community;
      5.   The necessity that certain types of facilities have a waterfront
location (e.g., marinas);
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
land use or development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program of that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action and
floating debris, if applicable, expected at the site based on the best
available information; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
Upon receipt of a complete variance application from the administrator, the
city council shall conduct a public hearing on the application and shall notify
in writing all adjoining property owners of the property in question at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. The city council shall act upon all
applications for a variance within a reasonable time following the public
hearing, considering the complexity of the justification. In no event shall the
council be required to act prior to the thirtieth day following the completion
of the hearing. However, the council may act within the thirty (30) day period
at its discretion.
   B.   Conditions For Variances: Upon consideration of the factors of
subsection A of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of this chapter.
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including
technical information, and report any variances to the federal insurance
administration upon request.
The following conditions shall apply:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances may be considered for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall not be issued because of mere economic or financial
hardship alone, or because of inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval or preference of neighbors.
      5.   Variances shall not be issued to avoid a more expensive development
alternative, or simply to avoid building in a nonpreferred location on a
parcel, or solely to avoid utilization of a parcel in a manner different from
that originally intended.
      6.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief, while maintaining the goals and objectives of the ordinance and minimum
standards for participation in the national flood insurance program.
      7.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing state, federal, and local laws or ordinances.
      8.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria, and otherwise complies
with all provisions of subsections 15.08.050A2, A4 and A5 of this chapter.
      9.   The decision to either grant or deny a variance shall be provided to
the applicant in writing and shall set forth the reasons for approval or
denial. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below
the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk. (Ord. 182, 5-13-2010)
15.08.080: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the administrator in the grant or
denial of a flood hazard development permit may appeal such decision to the
city council, by filing a notice of appeal stating the nature of the appeal
with the city council, within thirty (30) days of the return of the
administrator's decision to the applicant.
   B.   The city council, within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of a notice
of appeal, shall schedule and hold a public hearing in accordance with the
hearing provisions of 67-6509, Idaho Code, to further consider the application.
Following the public hearing, the city council shall, within fifteen (15) days
of the hearing affirm, affirm with modification or reverse the decision of the
administrator.
   C.   The decision of the city council shall be in writing and accompanied by
a statement in the form of findings of fact and conclusions of law that explain
the criteria and standards considered relevant, state the facts relied upon,
and explain the justification for the decision based upon the criteria,
standards, and facts as set forth.
   D.   In accordance with the provisions of Idaho Code, a person aggrieved by
a decision of the city council in its grant or denial of a development permit
may appeal the city council's decision to the district court.
   E.   Construction, development, or substantial improvement, as proposed in
any permit application, shall not be permitted while an appeal is still
outstanding. (Ord. 182, 5-13-2010)

17.40.010: GENERAL USE RESTRICTIONS:
No building or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed,
or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used for any purpose
other than is permitted in the district in which the building or land is
located, and except in conformity with regulations of the district in which the
building is located. (Ord. 213, 7-8-2021: Ord. 189, 8-9-2012)
17.40.020: BUILDING APPEARANCE AND MATERIALS:
All buildings or structures shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed or
altered to be of a rustic nature. The specifications contained herein are
intended to assist in defining such materials term "rustic nature" with respect
to the specific subject matter of this section. Exterior wall surfaces,
including siding and trim of all permitted building projects shall be of logs,
shakes, rough lumber, rough wood, board and batten, shingles, wood lap siding,
native stone, metal such as cold rolled steel that allows or approximates a
natural rusting finish, or concrete fabrication that truly resembles wood. All
exterior materials shall be non-reflective. All materials not approved include,
but are not limited to, stucco, plaster, brick, canvas, and vinyl. Rustic
roofing materials include shakes or wooden shingles, earth tone composite
shingle, concrete fabrication that truly resembles wood, and nonreflective
metal in colors as set forth herein. To prevent modernistic appearance, or
adverse visual impacts, flat or shed type roofs may be permitted on a case by
case basis by the City Council to protect scenic vistas by reducing ridgeline/
skyline visibility issues. If scenic visibility is not an issue, the Council
also may permit flat or shed roofs if the structure would remain in compliance
with the intent of Stanley Comprehensive Plan. Flat or shed type roofs are not
normally considered rustic. These flat and shed roof restrictions apply only to
main buildings, not to accessory buildings or to shed dormers and porch roofs.
Glass roofs are not permitted. Provided, however, that accessory buildings,
whether permanent or nonpermanent structures, used as greenhouses, can have
clear or translucent rigid or non-rigid exterior wall and roof surfaces not
meeting the criteria listed above, or if wall or roof surfaces are colored then
they shall conform to the approved color chart. Floor to ceiling windows,
commonly called "curtain windows" or "curtain walls" are not permitted.
   A.   Semitransparent stains which replicate natural wood colors or which
allow natural woodgrain and color to be visible through the stain are allowed.
   B.   Paint and solid stain treatments used for wall surfaces, trim, siding,
decking and railing or permanently colored metal and other permanently colored
materials used for wall surfaces, trim, siding, decking and railing must be in
subdued shades of colors which blend with the natural surroundings visible from
the building site. Certain specific shades of colors have been approved as
satisfying this definition. A chart showing the approved shades of colors is
attached to the ordinance codified herein as exhibit A, is incorporated herein
by this reference, and shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk.
   C.   Certain colors for nonreflective metal roofs have been approved as
satisfying the requirement that buildings be constructed in a "rustic nature".
A chart showing the approved colors for nonreflective metal roofs is attached
to the ordinance codified herein as exhibit B, is incorporated herein by this
reference, and shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk.
   D.   Porch, deck railings, and decorative architectural features shall be
constructed of wood, composite materials that appear like wood, stone, or metal
such as cold rolled steel that allows or approximates a natural rusting finish.
Screening, rods, cables, wires or posts must be of rusted metal or non-
reflective colors approved on the Exhibit A color chart. (Ord. 213, 7-8-2021:
Ord. 189, 8-9-2012: Ord. 184, 2-10-2011)
17.40.030: BUILDING HEIGHT:
No building within the city limits or area of city impact shall exceed twenty
eight feet (28') in height, except as provided in
17.40.032E, and except that a building that will skyline above a ridgeline as
viewed from a public vantage point entering the city or within the City of
Stanley shall be limited to a single story with a viewable facade no more than
eighteen feet (18') in height. (Ord. 213, 7-8-2021: Ord. 131, 3-4-1998: Ord.
70, 1984: Ord. 44, 1977)
17.40.032: HILLSIDE PROVISIONS:
   A.   The provisions of this section shall apply to any building site where
the topographic slope of said building site exceeds fifteen percent (15%)
grade.
   B.   Cut and fill slopes shall comply with the following development
standards:
      1.   Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material, such as
vegetation and rubbish, and any other material which is determined by the soils
engineer to be detrimental to proper compaction or otherwise not conducive to
stability; no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension
greater than eight inches (8") shall be used as fill material in fills that are
intended to provide structural strength.
      2.   Fills shall be compacted to at least ninety five percent (95%) of
maximum density, as determined by AASHO T99 and ASTM D698.
      3.   Cut slopes shall be no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one
vertical; subsurface drainage shall be provided as necessary for stability.
      4.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one
vertical; fill slopes shall not be located on natural slopes two to one (2:1)
or steeper, or where fill slope toes out within twelve feet (12') horizontally
of the top of an existing or planned cut slope.
      5.   Tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from property
boundaries a distance of three feet (3') plus one-fifth (1/5) of the height of
the cut or fill, but need not exceed a horizontal distance of ten feet (10');
tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from structures a
distance of six feet (6') plus one-fifth (1/5) the height of the cut or fill,
but need not exceed ten feet (10').
      6.   The maximum horizontal distance of disturbed soil surface shall not
exceed seventy five feet (75').
      7.   All cut and fill slopes shall be revegetated and/or rehabilitated
with retaining walls to eliminate unsightly hillside scarring and erosion. In
those instances when it is necessary to disturb naturally vegetated slopes
during construction of dwellings and other associated improvements, the
disturbed slope areas shall be repaired and revegetated. Temporary or permanent
watering systems shall be installed and maintained during revegetation to
ensure adequate growth on revegetated existing or new cut and fill slope areas.
Revegetation shall consist of drought tolerant ground cover plantings, dry land
grasses, shrubs, and trees combined with rock groupings, retaining walls or
other similar designs or methods to prevent soil erosion and unsightly views.
Plants and materials used in the revegetation shall not be of a type or variety
to cause an environmental threat or concern to the local or forest environment
and shall not include any plants listed as noxious weeds by Custer County.
   C.   Revegetation as defined in subsection B for all cut and fill slopes
shall be completed no later than twelve (12) months from the expiration date of
the building permit or within twelve (12) months of building completion,
whichever is earlier.
   D.   Retaining walls are limited to eight feet (8') in height above finished
grade of retaining wall unless otherwise approved by the city council. For
areas or slopes exceeding eight feet (8') in height above the finished grade,
or as required by engineering or other circumstances, stair stepped or offset
retaining walls shall be constructed. Unless approved otherwise by the city
council, the horizontal distance between the stepped or offset wall shall not
be less than one-half (1/2) the retaining wall height. Retaining walls shall be
constructed of durable or permanent materials, which are attractive earth tone
or natural material, or otherwise screened. Types of approved retaining wall
materials include keystone block, large rock, natural rustic wood, railroad
ties or other similar natural material. A "retaining wall" shall be defined as
a structure built of approved materials, whose purpose shall be to stabilize
existing or manufactured slopes for both the prevention of erosion and the
creation of a building site. A retaining wall, which is in an integral part of
a building's structural design, and is attached to the building shall be
considered as part of that building's "viewable facade", with the provision
that its total length does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the length of the
main building, and therefore not subject to the eight foot (8') height
limitation.
   E.   No building shall have a viewable facade that exceeds twenty eight feet
(28') in height, unless a daylight basement is approved by the City Council, in
which case the viewable facade as viewed from no more than three (3) sides
shall not exceed thirty eight feet (38') in height. A "daylight basement" shall
exist when at least one side of the basement level is totally or partially
excavated or backfilled into a hillside, and at least two (2) other sides
significantly excavated or backfilled into a hillside. At least one side must
have a viewable facade of no more than twenty-eight feet (28') in height. The
"viewable facade" of a structure shall be defined as the total visible portion
of that structure from any particular side, from lowest point to rooftop.
   F.   Construction of dwellings and associated improvements should take into
consideration the need for erosion control facilities and techniques during and
after construction. Silt fences, straw bales, berms and ditches are examples of
temporary techniques to control erosion. Under no circumstances shall
uncontrolled erosion be allowed to deposit eroded materials on any adjacent
lot, roadway, stream or wetland area. Existing or new cut and fill slopes
should be protected from erosion potential. Permanent erosion control
facilities should be incorporated in the design of the dwelling, lot grading,
landscaping and other improvements.
   G.   Building permit holders shall be notified by the City at least thirty
(30) days prior to a permit expiration date. Any person not completing the work
described in a valid building permit by the termination date on the permit and
who has not applied for a successor building permit shall be fined fifty
dollars ($50.00) per month until a successor building permit is approved. In
addition, the incomplete construction may be declared a public nuisance. Any
person violating any other provision of this section shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to such penalties as
provided by law. (Ord. 213, 7-8-2021: Ord. 152, 11-7-2001)

17.40.050: MINIMUM STREET WIDTH AND SIDEWALKS:
Minimum width of any street within the city shall be sixty feet (60'), and free
from any obstructions or encroachments. All sidewalks shall commence no more
than one foot (1') from the edge of the street right-of-way and continue
parallel to the centerline along the street at that same distance unless
obstructed by utility infrastructure. Sidewalks shall be constructed and
erected only upon the consent of the city council after a building permit has
been secured, as provided in this title. All sidewalks shall be boardwalks
which shall consist of two (2) parallel, ground level support beams of redwood
or pressure treated wood which is decay resistant. These support beams shall be
placed to support the interior edge and exterior edge of the walking surface.
The walking surface shall be a minimum of four feet (4') in width and consist
of new wood planking or appropriate wood-like material approved by the City
Council. The walking surface shall measure, at a minimum, one and three-fourths
inches by three and one-half inches (1¾" x 3½") set perpendicular to the
support beams. The walking surface of boardwalks shall be approximately six
inches to eight inches (6"-8") above the edge of the street. A sufficient
drainage system shall be provided by the applicant. (Ord. 213, 7-8-2021: Ord.

17.50.020: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter applies to all wireless communication facilities existing and
proposed to be located within the limits of the city of Stanley, Idaho.
Wireless communication facilities include personal wireless services as defined
by the TCA and licensed by the federal communications commission, including,
but not limited to, the types commonly known as cellular, personal
communications services ("PCS"), specialized mobile radio ("SMR"), enhanced
specialized mobile radio ("ESMR"), paging, land based repeaters for satellite
broadcast services, microcell antennas and similar systems which exist now or
may be developed in the future and exhibit technological characteristics
similar to them. This chapter shall also apply to wireless communication
facilities within public rights of way except as may be prohibited by state or
federal law. Wireless communication facilities proposed to be located in the
city of Stanley may be constructed only pursuant to permits issued by the city
in accordance with this chapter and shall comply with all other applicable laws
and regulations.
This chapter does not apply to handheld mobile (a.k.a. cordless) phones,

(Ord. 174, 11-30-2006)
17.50.040: PREFERRED LOCATIONS:
Wireless communication facilities are encouraged to be located in commercial,
recreation and public zoning districts whenever feasible. Applicants are
encouraged to site facilities on existing nonresidential buildings and existing
utility poles or towers. Antenna arrays are required to be located at least one
hundred feet (100') from property lines to schools, child daycare centers,
hospitals and residential dwellings unless a conditional use permit is granted
pursuant to section 17.50.060 of this chapter. Where facilities can be
consolidated onto a site and meet the standards of this chapter, such
collocation is encouraged. (Ord. 174, 11-30-2006)
17.50.050: BUILDING PERMIT:
Any and all wireless communication antennas, towers, support structures or
related communication equipment will require an approved building permit
obtained through the building application process and subject to review and
approval by the city council.
   A.   All property owners within three hundred feet (300') from the proposed
site shall be given notice of the project.
   B.   A propagation permit is required. A permit application is available
through the city office. (Ord. 174, 11-30-2006)
17.50.060: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS:
A conditional use permit can be considered where the applicant submits evidence
demonstrating that there is no other feasible alternative.
A propagation report is required for any conditional use permit. The report
shall be reviewed by a third party for independent review at the applicant's
expense. The city must approve the choice of the third party reviewer. (Ord.
174, 11-30-2006)
17.50.070: SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:
The following information must be submitted with the building permit
application:
   A.   Description Of Services: A description of the services the application
proposes to offer at the proposed site, including:
      1.   Documentation that the applicant has obtained and is in compliance
with all applicable licenses, permits or authorization required by the federal
communications commission.
      2.   Location of all existing, proposed and anticipated wireless
communication facilities in the applicant's network located in the city, or
within one mile of the city limits, in any direction.
      3.   A description of how the proposed facility fits into, and is a
necessary part of, the applicant's network.
      4.   If the proposal does not include collocation, written documentation
of all efforts made to collocate at another site, and a justification for the
decision not to collocate.
      5.   In the instance where a facility is proposed within one hundred feet
(100') of any school, child daycare center, hospital or residential dwelling,
the applicant shall submit a narrative description of alternative sites
considered, if any, and include specific reasons these alternative sites were
deemed infeasible.
   B.   Design: All project applications shall adhere to the following
criteria:
      1.   Location Relative To Schools, Child Daycare Centers, Hospitals, And
Residential Dwellings: Drawings shall include the location of all schools,

feet (100') from property line to the foot of the antenna array.
      2.   Height: Wireless communication facilities ("WCFs") shall not exceed
twenty eight feet (28') in height above the existing or natural grade or the
maximum permissible height of the given zoning district, whichever is more
restrictive, unless granted a conditional use permit. No conditional use permit
shall be granted that allows a facility within the city of Stanley or its area
of impact to exceed a maximum of forty five feet (45') in height. See section
17.50.080 of this chapter for exceptions to the height requirement for roof and
facade attached WCFs.
      3.   Minimal Visual Impact: All wireless communication facility
applicants shall employ all practical means to conceal or minimize the number
of facilities and reduce their visual impact, including:
         a.   Most Diminutive Technology: Use of the smallest components
necessary to provide service that is used or proposed for use within Custer
County.
         b.   Most Efficient Technology: Use of the most efficient components
to serve the city of Stanley. In this context, "most efficient" technology is
that which allows the applicant to use the fewest number of wireless
communication installations to serve the city of Stanley.
         c.   Stealth Design: The wireless communication facility shall be
designed to visually and operationally blend into the surrounding area, in a
manner compatible with the local community character. The facility shall use
the quietest cooling equipment and "whisper" emergency generating apparatus.
Artificial "trees" may be permitted in exceptional circumstances but are highly
disfavored and discouraged. When artificial trees are proposed, all paint,
materials and colors shall be listed by manufacturer and color number. When an
artificial tree is proposed, the applicant shall provide sufficient samples,
models or other information to demonstrate that alternative designs have been
considered and rejected, and the reasons for the rejections.
         d.   Landscaping: In the event portions of the facility will be
exposed to public view, and if additional plantings would further minimize the
visual impact of the facility, the applicant shall provide a landscape plan,
with an emphasis on native, drought tolerant plants. When existing mature
landscaping is proposed to be removed or trimmed for the installation or
operation of a wireless communication facility, the applicant shall identify
the location of said landscaping by species and size on the landscape plan. In
such an instance, trimming or removal of existing landscaping shall be minimal
and subject to approval by the city.
         e.   Setbacks: Wireless communication facilities shall comply with all
setback requirements for structures within the applicable zoning district.
However, where the proposed location would reduce visual impact, improve
safety, or otherwise exhibit superior design attributes, the applicant may
propose to locate any wireless communication facility component within a
required setback.
         f.   Engineering: All facilities shall be professionally engineered
with a stamped drawing documenting that the facility has been professionally
engineered for the location in Stanley and all of the extremes of the natural
phenomena in the area.
   C.   Operational Plan: All applications for wireless communication
facilities shall include written assurance that the facilities shall be
operated in accordance with the following:
      1.   Security Lighting: Security lighting shall be kept to a minimum in
every instance and should only be triggered by a motion detector where
practical. Security lighting potentially impacting residential districts and
prominent view areas shall be minimized and all lighting shall be compliant
with the city's exterior lighting regulations.
      2.   Maintenance: All facilities, landscaping, and related equipment
shall be maintained in good working order and free from trash, debris, and
graffiti and designed to discourage vandalism. Any damaged equipment shall be
repaired or replaced within thirty (30) calendar days. Damaged, dead or
decaying plant materials shall be removed and replaced within thirty (30)
calendar days.
      3.   Maintenance Hours: Routine maintenance of equipment located in or
adjacent to existing residential land uses shall be conducted only during the
hours of eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. weekdays, not
including holidays. In other areas, routine maintenance may be conducted at any
time. Emergency repairs and maintenance shall be conducted only in the cases of
power outages and equipment failure or malfunction. Equipment "change out" and
overhaul may occur any time with thirty (30) days' notice to the city to allow
notice to property owners and residents within one hundred feet (100') of the
facility, if applicable.
      4.   Monitoring: At five (5) year intervals from the date when the city
issues any permit authorized by this chapter, the applicant shall submit the
following information, in writing, to the city council:
         a.   Confirmation that the facility continues to operate in compliance
with all terms and conditions of approval by the city.
         b.   Independent field strength or power density measurements taken
within the past thirty (30) days that verify that the facility continues to
operate in compliance with all terms and conditions and emissions standards
imposed by the federal communications commission.
         c.   An evaluation of available equipment that would enhance the
safety, efficiency or visibility of the facility or reduce the size of the
facility.
         d.   An evaluation of available alternate locations for a potentially
more appropriate alternative.
         e.   Confirmation that the facility continues to function as an
essential element of the applicant's network.
         f.   Documentation of any complaints received by the applicant since
the inception of operations regarding the operation and maintenance of the
facility, including the application actions to address the complaints.
   D.   Construction Time, Abandonment, And Decommissioning: All wireless
communication facilities which receive a permit under this chapter shall be
completed and operational within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the
issuance of the permit and all related permits or licenses. The construction
time may be extended for an additional one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
upon a showing of good faith efforts to complete the facility, which shall take
into account complications beyond the control of the applicant including season
considerations. If the facility is not completed and operational by the end of
the extension period, then the permit shall expire, and the applicant must
reapply for the permit; however, this provision shall not apply when the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city council that the
operational delay is due entirely to factors beyond the control of the
applicant, in which event the council may extend the construction time at their
discretion. Any facility that ceases operating for more than ninety (90)
consecutive days shall be considered abandoned. In such an event, the applicant
must either: 1) apply for all permits required at the time of expiration to
reactivate the operation, or 2) remove all elements of the facility and restore
the site, as negotiated in the lease contract. In the event the applicant fails
to comply with permits or perform the removal and restoration within these
ninety (90) days, the property owner may seek another applicant for use of the
facility within one hundred eighty (180) days or shall have the facility
removed. (Ord. 174, 11-30-2006)

allowed within the zone and was legally established, then the combined height
of the building and antenna shall not exceed the maximum height allowed by such
approval unless determined by the council to be suitably camouflaged.
   D.   Street pole attached WCFs may only extend six feet (6') above the
existing street pole. A maximum extension of fifteen feet (15') from the top of
the street pole may be permitted pursuant to standards provided by building
application permit and/or conditional use permit if a utility disturbance can
be clearly demonstrated. Only one WCF shall be permitted on any one street
pole. The antenna shall be equal to less than six feet (6') in height,
including support system, if any. Surface area of the antenna shall not exceed

council may require to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the
intent and requirements of this chapter.

the district; and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan.
   H.   A list of the names and addresses of all property owners and residents
within three hundred feet (300') of the external boundaries of the land being

17.62.012: STANDARDS OF EVALUATION:
The council shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed conditional use in the terms of the following standards and shall find
adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   A.   Will, in fact, constitute a conditional use as established for the
zoning district involved.
   B.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the comprehensive plan and/or this chapter.
   C.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity, and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area as established by the zoning district.
   D.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses.
   E.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   F.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare, dust, odors, vibration, water pollution or safety hazards.
   G.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be designed
as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares.
   H.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic
or historic feature of major importance. (Ord. 110, 7-6-1993)
17.62.013: PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTIFICATION BY PUBLICATION AND MAIL:
Each application will be reviewed at a public hearing for which adequate public
notice will be given. A completed application will be heard by the commission
at a public hearing within forty five (45) days of its receipt of all elements
necessary to complete the application.
   A.   Notice of time, date, and place of the hearing and a summary of the
proposal shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.
Notice may also be made available to other newspapers, radio and television
stations serving the jurisdiction for use as a public service announcement.
   B.   Notice shall also be posted on the premises which are the subject of
the application not less than one week prior to the hearing.
   C.   Notice shall also be given by United States mail to each property owner
whose name appears on the list accompanying the application as an owner of
property within three hundred feet (300') of the boundaries of the subject
property. Individual mailings may be waived when the aforementioned list
includes the names of more than two hundred (200) property owners or residents
so long as an alternative method for giving notice is employed which is
reasonably calculated to give notice to said property owners. (Ord. 110, 7-6-
1993)
17.62.014: ACTION BY COUNCIL:
The council shall enter an order requesting additional specific information
from the applicant or approving, approving with additional conditions, or
disapproving the application within thirty (30) days after conclusion of the
public hearing together with the reasons therefor. Prior to granting a
conditional use permit, studies may be required of the social, economic, fiscal
and environmental effects of the proposed special use. In addition to the
conditions specified by the applicable ordinance, conditions which may be
attached for approval of an application include, but are not limited to, those
which will:
   A.   Minimize adverse impact on other development.
   B.   Control the sequence, timing, and duration of development.
   C.   Assure that development is maintained properly.
   D.   Designate the exact location and nature of development.
   E.   Require the provision for on site or off site public facilities or
services.
   F.   Mitigate foreseeable social, economic, fiscal and environmental
effects.
   G.   Require more restrictive standards than those generally required in an
ordinance.
   H.   Require mitigation of effects of the proposed development upon service
delivery by any political subdivision, including school districts, providing
services within the city. (Ord. 110, 7-6-1993)
17.62.015: NO PRECEDENT CREATED; NONTRANSFERABILITY:
A conditional use permit shall not be considered as establishing a binding
precedent to grant other special use permits. Each application shall be
considered upon its individual merits and the relevant conditions existing
within the city and adjoining affected areas at the time each application is
considered. A conditional use permit is not transferable from one parcel of
land to another. (Ord. 110, 7-6-1993)
17.62.016: NOTIFICATION:
Written notice of the council's decision shall be mailed to the applicant.
(Ord. 110, 7-6-1993)
17.62.017: EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL:
It is recognized that conditions relevant to consideration of a conditional use
permit application may change with time. It is further recognized that certain
types of conditional uses have the potential to become public nuisances if
mismanaged or operated improperly. Periodic review of such conditional uses is
therefore desirable. As a result, the council may establish, as a condition of
approval, a date upon which the permit will expire if all conditions are not
previously satisfied and the project is not completed. Said date must be
reasonably related to the circumstances of the proposed project and its impacts
on the community. The council may also establish expiration dates for
conditional use permits for those conditional uses which it deems pose the
potential to become public nuisances if mismanaged or operated improperly; said
expiration to occur even if all conditions of the permit have been or are
satisfied. (Ord. 110, 7-6-1993)
