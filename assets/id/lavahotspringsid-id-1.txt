and zoning commission (land development board) and the city council in the
establishment of the area of city impact:
      1.   Trade area;
      2.   Geographic factors; and
      3.   Areas that can reasonably be expected to be annexed into the city in
the future.
   C.   Geographical Area Of City Impact:
      1.   Map: The officially adopted geographic area of city impact is shown

provisions of comprehensive plans, the duly adopted comprehensive plan of the
city shall take precedence. The land development and land use ordinances of the
city shall prevail within the area of city impact, except, in those instances
in which the county land development ordinance is more restrictive, at which
time the county ordinances shall prevail. All land use development matters
shall be considered by the city in a manner like that of the provisions set
forth in Idaho Code section 50-1306.

3-1-8: REVIEW, APPROVAL AND ISSUANCE:
   A.   The City Council shall review all applications for business licenses
and approve or deny the same based on its judgment as to what is necessary to
protect and maintain the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of
and visitors to the City and/or reasonably lessen the adverse impact on
existing residential homes or businesses within the City.
   B.   The City Council may delay action to approve or deny an application if
the City Council determines that understanding the impact on the health, safety
and welfare of residents and visitors and/or determining the impact on
residential homes or businesses within the City require additional information
or investigation to properly review and consider the application for approval.
   C.   The City Council may consider the following list of criteria when
reviewing applications for business licenses, but the following is not intended
to be and is not an exhaustive list since what is necessary to maintain the
public health, safety and welfare of the residents of and visitors to the City
and/or impact on existing residential homes or businesses within the City is
not susceptible to a finite list of criteria and will vary depending on a wide
range of circumstances. Granting business licenses is discretionary and the
City Council is vested with broad discretion to consider any and all factors
and criteria which it believes are necessary to protect and maintain the public
health, safety and welfare of the residents of and visitors to the City and/or
reasonably lessen any adverse impact on existing residential homes or
businesses within the City. The following is a partial list of criteria which
may be considered along with the unique circumstances that are shown to exist
at the time the City Council considers applications for business licenses:
      1.   The City Council may deny an application if the applicant is under
eighteen (18) years of age.
      2.   The City Council may consider that the applicant has failed to
truthfully answer a question on the license application or failed to provide
information and documentation required by this Lava Hot Springs Business and
Special Event Regulation Code or requested by the City Clerk or the City
Council in the course of considering or investigating the application.
      3.   The City Council may consider whether the applicant's business
location is in compliance with the Building Code Ordinance of the City of Lava
Hot Springs, Idaho.
      4.   The City Council may consider whether the public health, safety and
welfare of the residents of and visitors to the City will be endangered by the
operation of the proposed business.
      5.   The City Council may consider whether there are practical methods to
reasonably lessen any adverse impact on existing residential homes or
businesses within the City by the operation of the proposed business and impose
the same as conditions to approval of the business license.
      6.   The City Council may consider whether the applicant refuses to agree
to accept, or is unlikely to follow or enforce, reasonable limits on the
operation of the proposed business which would reasonably mitigate the danger
to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of and visitors to
the City and/or would lessen the adverse impact on existing residential homes
or business within the City.
      7.   The City Council may consider that the applicant for a new or
renewal business license to operate a hotel, or a rental unit, or a boarding
house, or a bed and breakfast or a vacation rental or a tourist home have
failed to adequately provide for the health and safety of occupants, safeguard
the general welfare of nearby property owners or residents; and protect the
integrity of residential neighborhoods. If the applicant for a renewal business
license to operate a hotel, or a rental unit, or a boarding house, or a bed and
breakfast or a vacation rental or a tourist home has increased the number of
bedrooms, the number of permissible occupants and/or decreased the off-street
parking, the renewal will be rejected and the applicant will be required to
process the application as an application for a new business license rather
than a renewal business license.
      8.   When considering the renewal of business licenses and extensions of
thirty (30) day business licenses, the City Council may consider whether the
applicant, or the Mayor, or the City Clerk, or the City Code Enforcement
Officer have received complaints regarding the operation of the business in the
twelve (12) months preceding the renewal application or in the thirty (30) days
preceding the extension application. If the applicant has received complaints
regarding the operation of the business, the applicant shall disclose the
complaints in the renewal/extension application and/or shall be prepared to
explain the circumstances surrounding any complaints received by the Mayor, or
the City Clerk, or the City Code Enforcement Officer. The applicant will be
expected to explain to the City Council at the meeting in which the renewal/
extension is considered what, if any, remedial actions the applicant has taken
to remedy the complaints and will take in the future to prevent a recurrence of
such complaints which the City Council finds to be credible dangers to the
public health, safety and welfare of the residents of and visitors to the City
and/or finds as credible adverse impacts on the integrity of residential
neighborhoods and commercial areas in the City. Failure to adequately address
complaints and provide remedial action to the satisfaction of the City Council
may be grounds to deny a renewal/extension of a business license.

authorized to require additional information, including but not limited to a

documentary proof that the applicant obtained a comprehensive general liability
insurance policy with a minimum limit of five hundred thousand dollars

permit application, the City Clerk shall review the application for
completeness and, if found to be complete, forward it to the City Council for

Clerk has determined that the application is complete, but only if it is
considered complete at least seven (7) days prior to the date on which the next
regular meeting is scheduled. The seven (7) day deadline is required so that
there is sufficient and adequate time to make up the agenda, add the times to
the agenda, meet the time period requirement to post the agenda according to

agenda. It is highly recommended that the person seeking an event permit be

The mayor and council find and, therefore, declare as a matter of public policy
that the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city, as well as

hazards then existing. In every event, speed shall be so controlled as may be
necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle or other conveyance on or
entering the thoroughfare in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of
all persons to use due care. Where no special hazard exists that requires lower
speed for the purpose of compliance with this section, the speed of any vehicle
not in excess of the limits specified below shall be lawful, but any speed in
excess of such limits shall be prima facie evidence that the speed is not
reasonable or prudent and that it is unlawful.

6-4-1: AUTHORITY, PURPOSE AND SHORT TITLE:
   A.   Idaho Code sections 50-302, 50-314 and 49-208 authorize municipal
corporations to regulate, limit and control traffic and parking within its
boundaries.
   B.   Lava Hot Springs, Idaho ("City") is unique because of its small
geographical size and the topography of the property within the City limits.
The residents of the City are small in number and shrinking because of the
City's popularity as a tourist destination. Many of the streets and alleys
within the City are steep and/or narrow. Many residential neighborhoods do not
have off-street parking and the residents depend on on-street parking for their
personal vehicles. The purpose of the regulations and standards established
within this chapter is to ensure adequate on-street parking is provided and
maintained throughout the City for residents, tourists and businesses. These
regulations are intended to relieve parking congestion, provide for the safe
and orderly movement of traffic throughout the City, protect the integrity of
neighborhoods, accomodate residents who must compete for on-street parking with
visitors, reduce air and noise pollution, promote business by providing
adequate on-street business parking, and balance the needs of tourism with the
needs of residents and businesses for the use of limited on-street parking
spaces.
   C.   This chapter shall be known and cited as the Lava Hot Springs Parking
Code and may be referenced herein as "Parking Code." (Ord. 2020-2, 8-13-2020)
6-4-2: GENERAL PARKING RESTRICTIONS:
It shall be a violation of this Parking Code for any person to park a motor
vehicle, except when necessary to allow movement of other vehicular traffic or

not obstruct the natural flow of traffic. Such vehicles or trailers parked on a
City street or alley within a residential zone of the City for the purposes of
loading or unloading must be attended at all times and immediately moved upon

the use of water from such services for purposes other than fire extinguishing.
Sealed fire sprinkler systems with water operated alarms shall be considered as
having such provisions. The city may require that a suitable detector check
meter be installed in the standby fire protection service connections, to which
hose lines or hydrants are connected. All piping on the customer's premises
shall be installed in accordance with the plumbing code of the state of Idaho.
      2.   Charges For Service: Charges for standby fire protection service
shall be determined by resolution by city council upon written request for a
standby fire protection connection. No charge will be made for water used in
the standby fire protection services to extinguish accidental fires or for
routine testing of the fire protection system. The customers shall pay the full
cost of the standby protection service connection, any required detector check
meters, and any required special water meter installed for the service to the
standby connection.
      3.   Violations Of Regulations: If water is used from a standby pipe
connection service in violation of these regulations, an estimate of the amount

the regular rates, including the minimum charge based on the size of the
service connection and subsequent bills rendered on the basis of the regular
water rates.
   J.   Fire Service Connections Other Than Standby: A service having fire
protection facilities on the premises and water for other purposes flowing
through the same service connection shall be considered as an ordinary service
and metered as such. All water used through that service, regardless of its
use, will be charged at the regular rates.
   K.   Temporary Service Connections: For water service of a temporary nature,
applicants shall be required to pay in advance the estimated cost of

all possible care to prevent damage to the meter or to any other loaned
facilities of the city. If the meter or other facilities are damaged, the cost
of making repairs shall be paid by the customer and reimbursed to the city. The
city may also deduct the cost of repairs and replacement from the deposit fund
and require the customer to restore the deposit fund to its previous amount. If
the loaned materials are returned in satisfactory condition and all bills paid,

meter regularly stocked or furnished by the city, provided the request is
reasonable and further provided that the meter is not greatly oversized or
undersized, as determined by the water superintendent. The city reserves the
right to determine the type of meter to be installed.
   D.   Location Of Meters: Meters shall normally be placed at the curb or
property lines; the meter will be installed wherever the applicant desires

   C.   Disputed Bills: When a customer disputes the correctness of a bill, he
shall deposit the amount of the disputed bill at the time the complaint is
lodged, to preclude discontinuance of service pending final settlement of the
bill or bills. Subsequent bills shall be paid or placed on deposit in a similar
manner. Failure of the customer to make such a deposit shall warrant
discontinuance of service as provided under subsection F of this section.
   D.   Failure To Read Meters: In the event that it shall be impossible or
impractical to read a meter on the regular reading date, the water consumption
shall be prorated on the basis of thirty (30) days per month and the total
water consumption for billing purposes for that period shall be estimated.
   E.   Payment Of Bills: Each bill rendered shall contain the final date on
which payment is due. If the bill is not paid by that date, the account shall

meter shall be considered a delivery to the customer.
      5.   Service Charge: In all instances where water has been turned off
because of delinquent accounts, a service charge shall be made for the
restoration of services, and replacement of cash deposit as stated in
subsection
10-1-6B of this chapter, will be required. The service charge for restoration

days' notice, request the city to test the meter servicing his premises. The
city will require the customer to deposit the testing fee. This fee shall be an
estimate of the cost of testing the meter as determined by the superintendent.
The deposit will be returned to the customer if the test reveals the meter to
over register more than two percent (2%) under the standard test conditions.
However, if the meter tests within two percent (2%) accuracy, the deposit shall
be retained by the city. Customers may, at their option, witness any meter
tests which they request, but the customer shall not interfere with the testing
procedure or the person conducting the test. All tests shall be made during
normal business hours of the city.
      3.   On City Request: If, upon comparison of past water usage, it appears
that a meter is not registering properly, the city may at its option test the
meter and adjust the charges accordingly if the meter either over registers or
under registers. No charge for meter testing will be made to the customer for
the meter test under these conditions.
   C.   Adjustments Of Bill For Meter Error:

connection and will discontinue service to any persons or premises where a
cross connection exists. Service will not be restored until the cross
connection is eliminated. Customers using water from one or more sources in
addition to receiving water from the city on the same premises shall maintain
separate systems for each; and the city's water supply facilities shall be
separated from any and all other systems by an air gap of not less than one
foot (1'), or if in the ground, by not less than five feet (5').
   F.   Water Waste: Where water is wastefully or negligently used on a
customer's premises, seriously affecting the general service, the city may
discontinue service if such conditions are not corrected after due notice by
the city.
   G.   Service Detrimental To Others: The city may refuse to furnish water and
may discontinue service to any premises where excessive demands by one customer
will result in inadequate service to others.

reason and the water is turned on by the customer or other unauthorized person,
the water may then be shut off at the main or the meter removed. The charges
for shutting off the water at the main or removing the meter shall be computed
at actual cost to the city, plus ten percent (10%). These charges shall be
billed to the offending customer, and water shall not be furnished to the
premises or customer until such charges are paid and the city has reasonable
assurance that the violation will not reoccur.
   J.   Noncompliance With Regulations: The city may, upon five (5) days'
notice, discontinue service to a customer's premises for failure to comply with
any of the provisions of these regulations. If an emergency exists as a result

      1.   The sewer user charge for each user or user class shall be based on
the user's contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment
facilities in comparison to a standard equivalent user as defined.
      2.   The sewer user charge for each user shall be in accordance with the
equivalent user schedule established below. The sewer user charge for a single
user having more than one classification shall be determined by adding together
the equivalent user for each classification. The user charge for special users
contributing sewage of excessive flow and/or strength, for which the tabulated
equivalent users below do not apply, shall be individually calculated as
provided below. The monthly fee to be paid by each user shall be computed by
multiplying the sewer user charge for each user by a constant monthly cost
factor which shall be as set by the city council. The minimum sewer user charge
shall be one equivalent user.
   C.   Equivalent User: "One equivalent user" shall be defined as contributing
three hundred fifty (350) gallons per day of wastewater containing not more
than seven-tenths (0.7) pounds of five (5) day BOD and seven-tenths (0.7)
pounds of suspended solids. The equivalent user flow has been developed from
population and sewer usage records which indicate an average dwelling unit has
three and one-half (31/2) people contributing one hundred (100) gallons per
day. Standard engineering data indicates two-tenths (0.2) pounds of five (5)
day BOD and two- tenths (0.2) pounds of suspended solids respectively per
person per day. The basic equivalent user shall be subject to revision if
population, water usage, sewage volume, and/or other information indicates flow
and/or strength significantly different from that defined herein. Revision of
the basic equivalent user criteria shall normally only be made upon the
recommendation of a registered, professional engineer. (Ord. 1982-1, 2-17-1982)
   D.   Equivalent User Schedule: The number of equivalent users which shall
comprise the sewer user charge for each user and/or user class shall be in
accordance with the following equivalent user schedule. Assignment of
equivalent users shall apply for one year until the next annual user charge
review. Users so indicated or not included in this schedule shall be considered
special users and shall be evaluated separately as provided below. If and when
the information indicates that the strength of sewage contributed by any of the
following users is in excess in comparison with the allowable limits listed
above, then a surcharge shall be levied against such users as provided below.
Any of the users in the following schedule may be classified as special users
if information on their contribution flow and/or strength indicates a need to
do so:

Res. 2008-2, 9-9-2008)
   E.   Surcharge For Excessive Strength: When any user contributes wastewater
having an average BOD and/or suspended solids loading in excess of the
designated allowable limits hereinafter designated, a surcharge shall be levied
against such user. Said surcharge shall apply to sewage strength in excess of
two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) of BOD and two hundred milligrams
per liter (200 mg/l) of TSS. Said surcharge is based only on operation and
maintenance costs for the current year's city budget as determined in the user
charge system. Said surcharge shall be levied against the user in excess of the
charge provided in the user charge system schedule. The proportion of the
operating and maintenance costs (O&M costs) shall be distributed as follows:
Flow = 60 percent
BOD = 20 percent x cost of operation and maintenance
TSS = 20 percent x cost of operations and maintenance
The BOD and TSS loading shall be determined from the tests averaged over the
period made by city officials or the city engineer. The monthly user
surcharge shall be computed by use of the following equations:
BOD/$MO = Total Flow/MO x BOD-200 x 20% x EU O&M
     Tested                    
      200                10,500
WHERE : Flow is in gallons
     : BOD tested is in ppm or mg/l
     : 200 is the allowable limit in ppm or mg/l
     : EU O&M in ppm or mg/l
TSS/$MO = Total Flow/MO x TSS-200 x 20% x EU O&M
     Tested                   
      200                10,500
     : Flow is in gallons
     : TSS tested is in ppm or mg/l
     : 200 is in ppm or mg/l
     : EU O&M in ppm or mg/l
 
A copy of the list of user surcharge, the characteristics of their sewage, and
the surcharge for each shall be kept on file at all times in the office of the
city clerk-treasurer. (Ord. 1983-1, 1-19-1983)
   F.   Special Users:
      1.   Determination: If, in addition to excessive strength, a user is
determined to add flow to the lagoon in excess of ten thousand (10,000) gallons
per month, the above formula shall be multiplied by a factor of total flow
divided by ten thousand (10,000) gallons per month. In order to determine the
flow of this special user, the city may monitor sewage and water flow in order
to determine total flow. The value of user's monthly charge used in the formula
above will be the same value as assigned single dwelling units.
      2.   Copy On File: A copy of the list of special users, the
characteristics of their sewage, and the special user's monthly charge shall be
kept on file at all times in the office of the city clerk-treasurer.
   G.   User Request For Change In User Charge: Any sewer user who feels his
user charge is unjust and inequitable as applied to his premises within the
spirit and intent of the foregoing provisions may make written application to
the city council requesting a review of his user charge. Said written request
shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow and strength
of his wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the charge is based,
including how the measurements or estimates were made. Any flow measurements
and/or testing of wastewater shall be approved in detail by the city and/or its
engineer. Review of the request by the city council shall determine if it is
substantial or not, including recommended further study of the matter for the
city and/or user by a registered, professional engineer. (Ord. 1982-1, 2-17-
1982)
10-2-5: SEWER CONNECTION FEE:
   A.   Fee Established: Effective October 1, 2008, the sewer connection fee
for a user inside the city shall be as follows:

8 inch           2,000.00
 
(Ord. 2008-5, 9-24-2008)
   B.   Special Connections: Any special connections not covered by the above
schedules, including users outside the city, shall have connection fees set by
the mayor and city council in each individual situation. (Ord. 1982-1, 2-17-
1982)
   C.   Person Desiring Connection Responsible For Costs; Work Must Meet City
Standards: The foregoing fees are for the privilege of connecting with the city
sewer, and all work necessary for making proper connection shall be done to the
satisfaction of and under the supervision of the city inspector and shall be
paid for by the person desiring such connection. (Ord. 2008-5, 9-24-2008)
10-2-6: RULES GOVERNING CONNECTION FEES:
   A.   Any applicant for a sewer connection to any lot abutting on a street,
alley, or other right of way containing a main sewer line shall pay the full
connection fee therefor.
   B.   In case wherein two (2) or more dwellings exist on any lot under the
same ownership, and if any such dwellings are located to the rear of the other
or if at least seventy five feet (75') from the property line abutting on any
street, alley, or right of way containing a main sewer line, the rear dwelling
shall be charged one-half (1/2) the applicable full connection fee where the
owner thereof requested only one stub for dwellings on such lot and the same
service lateral is used for all such dwellings.
   C.   In any business block or shopping center containing more than one
adjoining business or commercial establishment under one ownership, where more
than one such establishment is connected with the same lateral but separate
applications for service are made and separate billings are requested, one of
such establishments shall pay the applicable full connection fee, and each
additional establishment shall pay one-half (1/2) the applicable connection fee
required for connection of similar size.
   D.   Any person owning unimproved real property which does not abut a
street, alley or right of way containing a main sewer line and who subdivides
the same for construction of dwellings shall install at his own cost all
connection lines acceptable to the city and connect the same to an existing
city main sewer line at a place to be determined by the city council and all at
the cost and expense of said subdivider. Each lot shall pay a hookup cost.
(Ord. 1982-1, 2-17-1982)
10-2-7: DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL USER CHARGES OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS:
The sewer user charge for the use of the sewer system outside of the city
limits shall be computed by multiplying the number of equivalent users
determined from the schedules set out above. (Ord. 1995-2, 4-13-1995)
10-2-8: EQUIVALENT USER FEE:
Effective October 1, 2008, the fee for "one equivalent user" for any connection
to the sanitary sewer system of the city shall be the constant sum of fifteen
dollars seventy five cents ($15.75) per month. Said fee may be amended from
time to time as required by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2007-6, 10-
11-2007; amd. Res. 2008-2, 9-9-2008)
10-2-9: METERED SERVICE:
Whenever the council shall deem it appropriate and in the best interests of the
city and its citizens to require a user to have a sewer and/or water service to
his facilities metered to more appropriately determine the amount of service
provided such user by the system, the council may, by resolution, require the
user to install a meter and/or meters which will accurately measure the
services provided; and the council may further establish, by resolution, the
rates to be charged for such service as will properly pay the fair share of the
services provided such user. The cost of the meter and its installation shall
be borne by the user. (Ord. 1982-1, 2-17-1982; amd. Ord. 2007-6, 10-11-2007)
10-2-10: PENALTY:

12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
Pursuant to Idaho Code sections 46-1020 through 46-1024, the legislature of the
state of Idaho has authorized local government units to adopt a floodplain map
and floodplain management ordinance and has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009,
eff. 7-7-2009)
12-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city of Lava Hot Springs are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health, and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
12-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to enact measures which require structures to
be built at a flood protection elevation and/or with floodproofing in order to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard;
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions; and
   I.   To reduce the annual cost of flood insurance. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009,
eff. 7-7-2009)
12-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

12-1-5: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application: (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES: Low cost buildings that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet, such as detached two (2) car garages, boathouses, small pole barns
and storage sheds, not to be used for human habitation, shall be constructed
and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow
of floodwaters; shall be anchored to prevent flotation which may result in
damage to other structures; service utilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the city clerk and/or code enforcement
officer's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: Designated as AO or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). AO zones have base flood depths that range from one to three
feet (3') above the natural ground, a clearly defined channel does not exist,
the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may
be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow; AH indicates ponding, and is

to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular
stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based
upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed
or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In
inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one
hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent
(1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.

cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
WATER DEPENDENT: A structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any
other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature
of its operations. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009; amd. Ord. 2015-12,

12-1-9: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
standards are required:
      1.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
(Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. For
more detailed information, refer to guidebook FEMA-85, "Manufactured Home
Installation In Flood Hazard Areas". (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      2.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. (Ord. 1987-
3, 4-8-1987)
         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the
flood protection elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be
increased. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      3.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

ground that is not in the floodway. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      4.   Subdivision Proposals:
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage; (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
         b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff.
7-7-2009)
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage; and (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
         d.   Where flood protection elevation data has not been provided or is
not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less). (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987;
amd. Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      5.   Review Of Building Permits: Where flood protection elevations or
other current engineering data are not available either through the flood
insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (subsection
12-1-7B2 of this chapter), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review,
and reasonably utilize scientific methods to assure that proposed construction
will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local
judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of
past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet (2')
above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance
rates. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where flood
protection elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection
12-1-6B or
12-1-7B2 of this chapter, the following provisions are required: (Ord. 1987-3,
4-8-1987; amd. Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   Where flood protection data is available, any structure or
manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above the flood protection elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. Standard foundation vents as required by the international
building code do not meet this standard.
            (4) Below grade, crawl spaces are prohibited at sites where the
velocity of floodwaters exceeds five feet (5') per second.
            (5) All building utility systems within the crawl space shall be
elevated above flood protection elevation or be designed so that floodwaters
cannot enter or accumulate within the system component during a flood.
            (6) The interior of a crawl space below the flood protection
elevation must not be more than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent
exterior grade (LAG) and the height of the below grade crawl space, measured
from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space
foundation must not exceed four feet (4') at any point.
            (7) Below grade, crawl spaces constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
However, applicants who construct buildings that have below grade crawl spaces
are hereby advised that such buildings will have higher flood insurance
premiums than buildings that have crawl spaces with interior elevations at or
above the lowest adjacent grade.
            (8) Below grade unfinished or flood resistant enclosures shall only
be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment, or
building access.
            (9) Otherwise follow the guidelines of the latest version of FEMA
TB 11-01 construction for buildings located in special flood hazard areas:
national flood insurance program interim guidance for crawl space construction.
(Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the flood protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall: (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987; amd. Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009,
eff. 7-7-2009)
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy;
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
12-1-7B3b of this chapter.
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection
12-1-9B1b of this chapter. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base
flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level). Floodproofing the
building an additional foot will reduce insurance premiums significantly.
         f.   Otherwise follow the guidelines of the latest version of FEMA TB
11-01 crawl space construction for buildings located in special flood hazard
areas: national flood insurance program interim guidance for crawl space
construction.
      3.   Manufactured Homes: All or varied placement of manufactured homes in
the floodplain shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is at or above the flood protection elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
12-1-9A1b of this chapter to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      4.   Recreational Vehicles: All recreational vehicles placed on sites
within the city shall either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days; or
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking
system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or
         c.   Meet the permit requirements of this chapter, and the elevation
and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" as defined in this chapter.
      5.   AE And A1-30 Zones With Flood Protection Elevations But No
Floodways: In areas with flood protection elevations (but a regulatory floodway
has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE
on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
      6.   Building Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Areas
of special flood hazard may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These
areas have base flood depths of one to three feet (3') aboveground, with no
clearly defined channel. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow.
In these areas the following provisions apply:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as depth number
specified in feet on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or at
least two feet (2') if no depth number is specified. Openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of subsection B1 of this section;
         b.   New construction or the substantial improvement of a
nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be
designed to be watertight to the specified flood protection elevation, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice; and
         c.   Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and
away from a proposed structure.
      7.   Critical Facility: Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard
area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated three feet (3') above FPE or to the height of the 500-
year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility
should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the level of the flood protection elevation shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
   C.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection
12-1-6B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection C1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
12-1-10: VARIANCE PROCEDURE:
   A.   Appeal Board:
      1.   The city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
      2.   The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
city clerk-treasurer and/or code enforcement officer in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987; amd. Ord. 2015-12, 12-

      3.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the city council, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the district court as provided under the
statutes of the state.
      4.   In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      5.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection A4 of this section
and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
      6.   The city clerk-treasurer and/or code enforcement officer shall
maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the
federal insurance administration upon request. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987; amd.
Ord. 2015-12, 12-10-2015)
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot, contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood
protection elevation. As the lot size increases the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases. (Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-
2009)
      2.   (Rep. by Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in subsection A4 of this section, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
      6.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
      7.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection B1 of
this section, and otherwise complies with subsections
12-1-9A1 and A2 of this chapter. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
      8.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987; amd. Ord. 2009-4, 7-2-
2009, eff. 7-7-2009)
12-1-11: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987)
12-1-12: VIOLATION AND PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject
to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 1987-3, 4-8-1987; amd. 2007 Code)
12-1-13: AMENDMENTS:
Amendments to this chapter or to the flood profiles or flood hazard boundary-
floodway map and water surface elevation of the base flood may be initiated by
the city council. Copies of such amendments shall be furnished to the federal
insurance administration within ten (10) days following adoption. (Ord. 1987-3,
4-8-1987)
