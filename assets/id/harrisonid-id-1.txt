effect the prosecution for violations of ordinances, which violations were
committed prior to the effective date hereof, nor be construed as a waiver of
any license, fee or penalty at said effective date due and unpaid under such
ordinances; nor be construed as affecting any of the provisions of such
ordinances relating to the collection of any such license, fee or penalty or

half (1/2) plus one of the full city council may dispense with the portions of

the city council for his approval. If the proper officer approves the same, he

such ordinance and return the same with his objection in writing at the next
regular meeting after the same has been presented to him, it shall become a law

certificate to the effect that the mayor has failed to sign or veto the same,

full members elected to the city council shall vote in the affirmative, the
ordinance shall become a law notwithstanding the mayor's veto 1 . In such case,
the city clerk shall annex a certificate to the ordinance stating that the same
was vetoed by the mayor and that, on its reconsideration, it received the
required majority of votes. (1983 Code § 2.04.100; amd. 2004 Code)

keep the original ordinances, and after final passage he shall copy the same at
length in a book to be known as the "Ordinance Book of the City of Harrison No.
    ", which book is to be provided by the city council for that purpose and

All such items shall be considered individually, in the order in which they
were objected to, immediately following consideration of the consent calendar.

1-10-9: AUDITS; DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS:
   A.   The City Treasurer may order an audit of any taxpayer under this
chapter for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness or completeness of any
return or payment.
   B.   If any error or omission is discovered in such audits or in any other
way, the City Treasurer may compute and determine the amount of tax due upon
the basis of facts obtained from such information within its possession and
assert a deficiency. One or more deficiency determinations may be made for the
amount due for one or for more than one period. In making such a determination,
the City Treasurer may offset overpayments against amounts due. Further, said
determinations shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the
person fails to make a return and shall be based upon any information which is
in the City's possession.

(30) day period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the
period.
   B.   If a petition for re-determination is filed within the thirty (30) day
period the City Council shall reconsider the determination and, if the person
so requests in the petition, grant the person an oral hearing and give said
person ten (10) days' notice of the time and place of the hearing personally or
by mail addressed to the person at the address furnished to the City Clerk in
said person's application for a local option non-property tax permit. (Ord.

1-10-11: APPEALS, INTEREST ON DEFICIENCY:
   A.   When a re-determination is made, the City Treasurer shall give notice
to the taxpayer against whom the re-determination is made. Within thirty (30)
days of the date upon which such notice of re-determination is mailed or
served, the taxpayer may file an appeal with the City Council or may file a
complaint with the District Court for review of the City's re-determination. An
appeal from the re-determination shall be made in accordance with the laws of
the state of Idaho with regard to claims against municipalities.
   B.   There shall be no right of review to the City Council nor to the
District Court on the determination of taxes due made unless a re-determination

imposed by this chapter or proceeding to collect for its collection shall be
made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer
and expiration of such thirty (30) day period after notice of re determination,
nor if a protest is filed until a decision on the protest becomes final. If the

Court within the time prescribed in this section, the deficiency shall be
assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and demand.

As soon as practical after the monthly local-option non-property tax return and
payment are filed, the City Treasurer shall examine the same and determine the
correct amount of the tax to be collected by the City of Harrison. For the
purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any payment determining the amount
of tax due where none has been made, determining the liability of any person
for any tax payable under this chapter, or the liability at law or in equity of
any person in respect to any tax provided by this chapter or collecting any
such liability, the City Treasurer or duly authorized agent, is authorized (1)
to examine the books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or
material to the inquiry; (2) to summons the person liable for the tax or any
officer, agent or employee of such person, or any person having possession,
custody or care of books of accounting containing entries relating to the
business of the person liable for the tax, to appear before the City Treasurer,
or authorized agent, at a time and place named in its summons to produce such

for non-property taxes from that person, and any balance refunded to the person
by whom it was paid or to his successors, administrators or executors.

the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date that such tax was
paid.

claims against municipalities. (Ord. 489, 1-11-2024)

1-10-15: PERIOD OF LIMITATION UPON ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION:

assessment. The running of limitations provided by this section shall be
suspended for the period during which the City is prohibited from making the
assessment or from collecting or proceeding in Court due to a petition for re-
determination or an appeal therefrom, and for thirty (30) days hereafter.

shall be assessed, and any proceeding in court without assessment for the
collection of such tax shall be begun, within six (6) months after the written

administrator, or other fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent
unless the assessment is stayed by a petition for re-determination or any
appeal therefrom.
   C.   In the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade
tax, or of a failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding
in Court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any
time within three (3) years after the date of the discovery of the facts
constituting the fraud. (Ord. 489, 1-11-2024)

due under this chapter until such time as the vendor produces receipt stating
that no amount is due.

property tax becomes final, the City of Harrison shall have the right to revoke
any other permits issued by the City of Harrison to the person violating any
provision of this chapter. Whenever a person subject to this chapter has had

(whichever is greater). The City Treasurer shall assess and collect said fee at

prima facie evidence that the lessee or renter of the vehicle was the person

of any applicant or consumer of water, provided that the distance is not
greater than seventy five feet (75'). All pipe of one inch (1") in size is to
be laid by and under the direction of the city water department, and the

responsible for all damages resulting from leaks or breaks to the service pipe
on his property. No claim shall be made against the city on account of the

property. Where a break or leak occurs in a lateral service pipe, the property
owner or water consumer will be required to repair the pipe at his own expense
and to protect the city and the water department from any cost for such repair.
If, after being notified, the owner of the property upon which a break or leak

has been properly repaired and the owner or water consumer has paid to the city
the fees set out in chapter 5 of this title for the shutting off and turning on

property owner or water consumer shall be responsible for any and all damages
resulting therefrom. Where there is a leak and it is doubtful whether the water
is from a break in the city main or in a private service pipe or lateral line,
the city shall have charge of the repairs but the costs of repairs shall be
assessed to the proper private property owner or consumer in the event the leak

7-2A-2: Basic Rate Classes Established
7-2A-3: Computation Of Charges
7-2A-4: Sewer Service Reconnection Fee
7-2A-5: Additional Fees
7-2A-1: DEFINITION:
LIVING UNIT: Any improved real property or portion thereof which is used or
occupied or is intended, arranged or designed to be used as the home, residence
or sleeping place of one or more human beings, but not more than one family.
Without intending to limit this definition in any way, the term "living unit"
is intended to include each and every trailer pad with sewer facilities,
apartment unit in an apartment complex, and each cottage or portion thereof
used or intended to be used by one family, whether occupied or not. (1983 Code
§ 13.10.040)
7-2A-2: BASIC RATE CLASSES ESTABLISHED:
Separate basic rates and charges for furnishing sewage disposal service shall
be established by the city council from time to time for each of the following
classes of users:
   A.   Occupied residential within the city.
   B.   Residential outside the city.
   C.   Commercial, multiple residential:
      1.   For any apartment building or similar commercial facility composed
of multiple dwelling units wherein persons reside on a permanent or
semipermanent basis, the monthly base rate shall be assessed for each living
unit within said complex whether or not said units are actually occupied.
      2.   The above stated rate class shall not apply to motels, trailer camps
or similar facilities providing accommodations to transients, which facilities
shall be classified as commercial property under subsection E of this section.
   D.   Unoccupied residential structures.
   E.   Commercial (public retail, nonresidential).
   F.   Unoccupied commercial structures.
   G.   Industrial (any nongovernmental user of publicly owned treatment works
identified in the "Standard Industrial Classification Manual 1972", office of
management and budget, as amended, and supplemented under the following
divisions:
 
Division A: Agriculture, forestry and fishing;
Division B: Mining;
Division D: Manufacturing;
Division E: Transportation, communications, electric, gas and sanitary
            services;
Division I: Services.
 
   A user in the divisions listed may be excluded if it is determined that it
will introduce primarily segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary
conveniences). Rates to be established individually by contract to be
commensurate with other charges in the city; however, rates will comply with
the federal guidelines and/or regulations pursuant to the water pollution
control act.
   H.   The city reserves the right to determine the type of customer receiving
sanitary service and to classify the type of customer within the foregoing
categories. The city further reserves the authority to delegate the duty to so
classify customers. In the event there arises a dispute relative to the type of
customer receiving sewer service and thus as to the applicable sewer service
rate, the city's determination as to the type of customer shall be binding upon
the customer in the absence of manifest error. A customer disputing the
classification shall have the right to appeal the determination of the city by
making a written request to the city council for a redetermination hearing and,
after a hearing on the matter, the determination of the city council shall be
likewise binding on the customer in the absence of manifest error.
   The written request for redetermination shall set forth with reasonable
clarity the reasons for the request. The redetermination hearing shall be held
at city hall at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council, or at
such time and place as the city council may order; provided, however, that any
hearing held other than at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city
council or at the city hall shall be held only upon at least five (5) days'
written notice to the party requesting the hearing, setting forth the time and
place of hearing. At such hearing, either party may present witnesses and other
evidence, but a failure by the city to present witnesses or other evidence
shall in no way invalidate the decision of the city council, it being the
requesting party's burden to convince the city council that reclassification
should be made. All charges shall begin with the date of classification by the
city, rather than the date of any final appeal determination. (Ord. 323, 2-2-
1993)
7-2A-3: COMPUTATION OF CHARGES:
   A.   All fees and charges are subject to modification by resolution upon
review by the city council of the revenues and costs of the sewerage system,
which review shall be carried out at least once during any given twelve (12)
month period of operation of the system.
   B.   Charges based on water consumption shall be computed on the monthly
average over the previous twelve (12) month period, with an adjustment at the
end of each twelve (12) month period. The adjusted average shall be the basis
for the succeeding twelve (12) month period. In the event that any unit of
occupancy does not have a twelve (12) month record of water consumption,
billing shall be estimated and agreed upon between the city and the customer,
until such a record is available, and adjustment for the previous twelve (12)
month period shall be made at that time. (Ord. 323, 2-2-1993)
7-2A-4: SEWER SERVICE RECONNECTION FEE:
Once sewer service to a property has been terminated, as provided in section
7-2-6 of this chapter, a reconnection fee shall be paid to the city before

The city council determines and declares that:
   A.   This chapter is intended to assist in the improvement and increased
capacity of the city water and sewer systems.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to assure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to provide
water and sewer facilities in the city.
   C.   This chapter is also intended to permit the city to recover its
installation costs. (Ord. 378, 8-6-2002)
7-3-4: BASIS FOR FEES:
   A.   The city must expand its water and sewer facilities if new development
is to be accommodated without decreasing current standards of public health.
   B.   The imposition of connection fees is one of the preferred methods of
ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of water and
sewer facilities necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done
in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare.

the size of the meter for the new connection over the size of the meter for the
previous connection.
   C.   Independent Fee Calculation: If a fee payer opts not to have the
connection fee determined according to subsection A of this section, then the
fee payer shall prepare and submit to the city council an independent fee
calculation study for the land development activity for which a connection to
the city's water and/or sewer system is sought. The independent fee calculation
study shall follow the prescribed guidelines adopted by motion of the city
council. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the
independent fee calculation was made. The city shall consider the documentation
submitted by the fee payer, but is not required to accept such documentation as
he shall reasonably deem to be inaccurate or not reliable and may, in the
alternative, require the fee payer to submit additional or different
documentation for consideration. If an acceptable independent fee calculation
study is not presented, the fee payer shall pay water and per facilities fees
based upon the fee schedule adopted by resolution. If an acceptable independent
fee calculation study is presented, the city council may adjust the fee to that
appropriate to the particular fee payer. If the calculation proves to be more
than twenty percent (20%) inaccurate, the city may recalculate the fee later
and require an additional payment or credit.

of environmental quality, IDAPA 58.01.20, rules for administration of drinking
water loan program, and section 1003 of the uniform plumbing code, is to
protect the public health by the control and prevention of actual and potential
cross connections by requiring the proper installation and safeguarding of
service lines leading to premises where cross connections exist or are likely
to occur, by periodic inspection and by regulating plumbing within premises or
to the public water system itself. An additional purpose is to provide for the
maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control, which will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all
potable water delivered by the water systems of the city. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-2: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter applies throughout the city and outside the city limits to every
user and to every premises, whether residential or commercial, and the owners
and occupants thereof served by the water system of the city. It applies to all
systems installed prior to or after its enactment, both inside and outside the
city limits. Every owner and occupant of any premises covered by this chapter
is responsible for compliance with its terms and shall be strictly liable for
all damages incurred as a result of failure to comply with the express terms
and provisions contained herein. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-3: ENFORCEMENT:
The mayor and city council, by and through the department of public works, will
administer the provisions of this chapter. Any deviation, modification or
change from approved standards must be approved in advance by the mayor and
city council. Penalties for violations of this chapter shall be as set forth in
section
7-6-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-4: DEFINITIONS:
AIR GAP (AG) SEPARATION: The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level rim of the
receptacle, and must be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case may the
gap be less than one inch (1").
APPROVED ASSEMBLY: Any backflow prevention assembly which has satisfactorily
completed laboratory and field tests by an independent laboratory recognized by
the Idaho department of health and welfare and/or the Idaho department of
environmental quality, and which is selected by the owner, user or occupant
from the state approved list.
AUXILIARY SUPPLY: Any water source or system other than the city water system
that may be available in the building or on the premises.
BACKFLOW: The flow, other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign
liquids, gases or substances into the distribution of the public water system.
Back Pressure: Backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or other means
that could create pressure within the system greater than the potable water
supply system.
Back Siphonage: A form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure
within the water system.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly to counteract back pressures or
prevent back siphonage.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical arrangement whereby a public water system is
connected, directly or indirectly, with any other nonpotable water system,
sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture or other
device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage or other
waste liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting
contamination to the public water system as a result of backflow. Bypass
arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover
devices, or other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of
which, backflow may occur are considered to be cross connections.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA): An assembly composed of two (2) single,
independently acting check valves, including resilient seated tightly closing
shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and equipped with properly
located resilient seated test cocks for testing the water tightness of each
check valve.
PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER BACK SIPHONAGE PREVENTION ASSEMBLY (PVBA): An assembly
containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an
independently operating internally loaded air inlet valve located on the
discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly
located resilient seated test cocks and tightly closing resilient seated
shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed
to protect against a back siphonage condition only.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY (RPBA): An assembly
incorporating two (2) or more check valves and an automatically operated
differential relief valve located between the two (2) checks. Two (2) resilient
seated shutoff valves, one located at each end of the assembly and equipped
with properly located resilient seated test cocks for testing. The assembly
must operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check
valves, less than the pressure on the public water system side of the assembly.
At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves must be less
than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve must operate to maintain the reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure drops below two (2)
pounds per square inch, the relief valve must be open to the atmosphere thereby
providing an atmospheric zone between the two (2) check valves. (Ord. 452, 1-7-
2014)
7-6-5: CROSS CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED:
   A.   All cross connections, whether or not they are controlled by automatic
devices such as check valves or by hand operated mechanisms such as gate valves
or stopcocks, are prohibited.
   B.   Any reinjection of water by individual, residential, commercial or
industrial use of the public water system is specifically prohibited. Water to
water and water to air heat exchangers are considered a cross connection
because of health risks. Any modifications allowing reinjection are prohibited.
   C.   Failure on the part of persons, firms or corporations to discontinue
the use of all cross connections and to physically separate cross connections
is sufficient cause for the immediate discontinuance of public water services
to the premises. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-6: INSTALLATION OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLIES:
Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed in accordance with this
chapter, at the service connection or within any premises where, in the
judgment of the city by and through the public works department, the nature and
extent of the activity on the premises, or the material used in connection with
the activities, or the materials stored on the premises would present an
immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross connection occur, even
though such cross connection does not exist at the time the backflow prevention
device is required to be installed, including, but not limited to, the
following:
   A.   Premises having auxiliary water supply.
   B.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable, or
intricate plumbing arrangements that make it impractical to ascertain whether
or not cross connections exist.
   C.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficient short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist.
   D.   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being
established or reestablished.
   E.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water system, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This includes the handling of process waters
and cooling waters.
   F.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
such that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard may result.
   G.   The following types of facilities require mandatory service protection,
including, but not limited to:
      1.   Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics;
      2.   Laboratories;

department, of the intended assembly installation is required prior to water
service being provided by the city to the applicant. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-8: TYPES OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLIES REQUIRED:
The type of prevention device required depends on the degree of hazard that
exists:
   A.   An air gap separation or reduced principle backflow prevention assembly
shall be installed where the water supply may be contaminated by sewage,
industrial waste of a toxic nature or other contaminant which could cause a
health or system hazard.
   B.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not hazardous
to health, an air gap separation or a reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly, or a double check valve assembly, shall be installed.
   C.   Lawn sprinkler systems which are supplied by city water only shall be
required to have either a double check valve backflow prevention assembly or a
pressure vacuum breaker assembly or atmospheric vacuum breaker assembly
depending on the design of the sprinkler system and potential risk to the
potable water supply. The design of backflow prevention assemblies larger than
one inch (1") will be submitted and approval made by the public works director.
All backflow prevention assemblies shall be of a type approved by the state
department of environmental quality. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-9: LOCATION:
Backflow prevention assemblies required by this chapter must be installed at
the meter on metered accounts or at the property line of the premises when
meters are not used or at a location designated by the public works department
so as to be readily accessible for maintenance and testing, where no part of
the device will be submerged or hidden from proper inspection. (Ord. 452, 1-7-
2014)
7-6-10: INSTALLATION, APPROVAL AND ACCEPTABLE TYPES:
Any backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter shall be a model
approved by the public works director. A double check valve assembly or a
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly will be approved if it
has successfully passed performance tests of the University Of Southern
California Foundation For Cross Connection Control And Hydraulic Research, or
other testing laboratories satisfactory to the state and the city public works
department. Backflow prevention assemblies which are already in service as of
the effective date of this chapter but are not listed shall be permitted to
remain in service provided they:
   A.   Were listed on the current approved cross connection control assembly
list at the time they were installed;
   B.   Are properly maintained;
   C.   Are commensurate with the degree of hazard; and
   D.   Are tested and successfully pass the test annually.
When these assemblies are moved or require more than minimum maintenance, they
shall be replaced by an assembly that is on the current list of approved
assemblies. To maintain their approval status, all assemblies must be delivered
to the job site and be installed with the shutoff valves #1 and #2 and test
cocks which are supplied by the device manufacturer. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-11: INSPECTIONS AND TESTING:
   A.   Inspections: The reduced pressure principle backflow assembly and the
double check valve assembly must be inspected annually or more often when
successive inspections indicate failure.
   B.   Testing And Maintenance:
      1.   Each backflow prevention assembly shall be inspected and tested to
ensure that it functions properly:
         a.   Upon installation.
         b.   After repairs.
         c.   After being relocated, moved or reinstalled.
         d.   Annually.
      2.   The assembly owner shall be notified one month prior to the date for
annual testing. It is then the assembly owner's responsibility to acquire the
services of a certified tester to test the assembly and provide the public
works director a copy of the test results. If the test indicates the assembly
must be repaired, the owner shall be responsible for making repairs and a
record of the repair work and a report of satisfactory final test must be sent
to the public works director. The annual testing of backflow prevention
assemblies must be done prior to any repair work or flushing of the relief
valve, to properly reestablish its operating status. Failure to test and
maintain backflow prevention assemblies is grounds for the city to discontinue
water service. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-12: SERVICE FEE SCHEDULE:
The city retains the authority to adopt a fee schedule for services provided by
the city under this chapter by resolution adopted at a regular meeting of the
city council. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)
7-6-13: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
The failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, test
or inspection of backflow prevention assemblies required by this chapter is
grounds for termination of water services to the premises. Reconnection of a
service which has been disconnected from the city water system for
noncompliance with this chapter shall be a misdemeanor. Each day of a violation
shall be considered a separate offense, and each offense may be punishable as
provided in the general penalty in section
1-3-1 of this code. This chapter may also be enforced by appropriate civil
action in a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 452, 1-7-2014)

8-3-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho
Code 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local government units to adopt a
floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies floodplains
and that sets forth minimum development requirements in floodplains that are
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
   B.   Findings Of Fact: The flood hazard areas of Harrison are subject to
periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
      1.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      2.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adoption and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters.
   D.   Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to:
      1.   Protect human life, health and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions. (Ord. 435, 5-3-2010, eff.

facilities include essential facilities, transportation systems, lifeline
utility systems, high potential loss facilities and hazardous material
facilities.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
has been the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical
datum currently adopted by the federal government as a basis for measuring
heights is the North American vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations, and permanent

FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by
floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the
federal insurance administration or U.S. department of housing and urban
development, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been
designated as zone A. The FHBM usually is the initial flood hazard map.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, issued by the
federal insurance administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard
and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report by the federal insurance
administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles, floodway
boundaries and water surface elevations of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
   B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.

regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe 1 .
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge
and store the floodwater or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY: A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The
term does not include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for HAG related to
building elevation information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:

approved programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
         A. Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. An LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
         B. Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
showing that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones,
flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric
features. One common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination that a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C. Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
national flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

structure. Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for LAG related
to building elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a
structure's lowest floor. The lowest floor is a determinant for the flood
insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after May 3, 2010, and includes subsequent improvements to the structure.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed on or after May 3, 2010.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A. Built on a single chassis,
   B. Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty truck,
and
   D. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damages
occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
market value of the structure should be: a) the appraised value of the
structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or b) in the
case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This
term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not include
either:
   A. A project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B. Alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the governing body from a requirement of this
chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 435, 5-
3-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)

      2.   Nonresidential Construction:
         a.   New construction or the substantial improvement of any
nonresidential structure located in zones A1-30, AE, or AH must be floodproofed
if the new construction or improvement is not elevated. The structure and
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to
the flood protection elevation or to one foot (1') above the base flood
elevation, whichever is higher, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A licensed
professional engineer or architect must certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
these provisions, and shall provide certification to the administrator.
      3.   Cumulative Effect Of Proposed Developments: Where the floodway has
not been determined, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted in zones A1-30 and AE on the
effective FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. Applicants of
proposed projects that increase the base flood elevation more than one foot
(1') are required to obtain and submit to the floodplain administrator, a
conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) preconstruction.
      4.   Flood Hazard Map Changes: Postconstruction, the applicant must apply
to FEMA for a letter of map revision for changes to the flood hazard map
proposed in the CLOMR.
      5.   Drainage Paths: In AH zones, drainage paths shall be provided to
guide floodwater around and away from proposed and existing structures.
   H.   Standards For Zones Without Base Flood Elevations And/Or Floodway (A
Zones): These standards apply in special flood hazard areas where streams exist
but no base flood elevation data have been provided (A zones), or where base
flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated.
      1.   When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified
by FEMA in a flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, then the
floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. If data
are not available from any source, only then subsections H2 and H3 of this
section shall apply.
         a.   Where the floodplain administrator has obtained base flood
elevation data, applicants of proposed projects that increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot (1') shall obtain a conditional letter of map
revision preconstruction and a letter of map revision postconstruction.
      2.   No encroachments, including structures or fill, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or fifty feet (50'), whichever
is greater, measured from the ordinary high water mark, unless certification by
a licensed professional engineer documents that the encroachment will not
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood.
      3.   In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new
construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawl space)
elevated no less than two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
subsection B4 of this section.
   I.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Shallow flooding
areas designated AO zones, are areas of special flood hazard that have base
flood depths of one to three feet (3'), with no clearly defined channel. The
following provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the adjacent grade at least as high as the flood depth number
specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). If no flood depth
number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at
least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the construction standards in subsection B4 of this section.
      2.   New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential
structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure and attendant
utility and sanitary facilities must be designed to be watertight to the
specified base flood level or at least two feet (2') above highest adjacent
grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these
provisions, and shall provide certification to the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away
from all proposed and existing structures.
   J.   Alteration Of A Watercourse: A watercourse is considered altered when
any change occurs within its banks.
      1.   The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development and submit certification by a registered professional
engineer that the bank full flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not
be diminished.
      2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. army corps of engineers and the Idaho
department of water resources stream channel alteration program must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
notification must be submitted to the floodplain administrator and to the
federal emergency management agency.
      3.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      4.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in subsections K1 and K2 of this section when an alteration of a watercourse
results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area,
including the placement of culverts.
   K.   Requirement To Submit New Technical Data:
      1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts;
         d.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
establishment of base flood elevations according to subsection A3 of this
section.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or
letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for
these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. 435, 5-
3-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)
8-3-6: VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Variance:
      1.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the city clerk on
the form provided by the city and include, at a minimum, the same information
required for a development permit and an explanation for the basis for the
variance request.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the variance
request will be set for public hearing at the next city council meeting in
which time is available for the matter to be heard.
      3.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be published
in the official newspaper of the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice shall be
provided to all adjoining property owners.
      4.   The burden to show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   B.   Criteria For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances may be issued upon:
         a.   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances.
      5.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
      6.   Variances should be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances.
   C.   Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance
shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and
denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice
along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its
lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
   D.   Appeals: The city council shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the administrator.
      1.   An appeal must be filed with the city clerk within fourteen (14)
days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the administrator.
Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure to exhaust the
administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the interpretation of the
administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts relied upon by the
appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in the interpretation.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled for
the next available city council meeting to be heard. The city council shall
consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, including:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (11)   The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   E.   Decision: The city council decision on appeal shall be in writing and
set out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
(Ord. 435, 5-3-2010, eff. 5-3-2010)
8-3-7: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered
unless in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking
such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

9-8-3: Special Uses
9-8-4: Required Conditions
9-8-5: Prohibited Uses
9-8-6: Nonliability Provisions
9-8-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the FP district is to guide development in the floodway and
floodway fringe areas of any watercourse that floods, and to minimize the
expense and inconveniences to the individual property owners and the general
public caused by flooding. Uses permitted and conditional uses that are
authorized in this district are generally associated with open space,
recreational and agricultural land uses and shall not hinder the movement of
floodwaters. The FP district is superimposed over other districts. (Ord. 341,
9-10-1996)
9-8-2: PERMITTED USES:
All uses are permitted in the respective districts with which the FP district
is combined, with the exception that structures used in carrying out those
permitted activities must be approved by the city council under the special use
permit procedure and deemed appropriate to be located within the floodway or
floodway fringe. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-8-3: SPECIAL USES:
When authorized under the procedure provided for special uses in this title,
the following uses will be permitted in an FP floodplain overlay district:
   A.   Structures used in carrying out permitted activities, provided detailed
engineering data is supplied by the applicant who bears the burden of proof
that such structures can be located in areas of plateaus, benches or upon
manmade fills or can be otherwise elevated so as not to be affected by
floodwaters, provided that:
      1.   Sewer and water systems shall be floodproofed and approved by the
district health department or the department of health and welfare that has
jurisdiction; and
      2.   No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building
or structure shall be extended or moved unless the main floor of said building
or structure is placed a minimum of one foot (1') above the elevation of the
100-year flood level. No basement floor shall be below this one foot (1')
safety margin. Foundations of all structures shall be designed and constructed
to withstand flood conditions at the site; and
   B.   Other structures used in carrying out permitted activities, provided
such structures will not be subject to substantial flood damage and will not
increase flood related damages on other lands. These may include structures
which can be readily removed from flood hazard areas during periods of high
water. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-8-4: REQUIRED CONDITIONS:
   A.   General: Conditions that may be required by the city council in
approving the use of structures in an FP floodplain overlay district shall
include:
      1.   Limitations on periods of use and operation;
      2.   Imposition of deed restrictions;
      3.   Location and arrangement of structures within the floodway and
floodway fringe areas to avoid an increase in flood heights during the
recurrence of the 100-year flood discharge;
      4.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees and other protective measures;
      5.   Placement of survey bench marks; and
      6.   Floodproofing measures designed to be consistent with the flood
protection elevation for a particular area:
         a.   Anchorage to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement;
         b.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters;
         c.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures;
         d.   Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls;
         e.   Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation;
         f.   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures;
         g.   Construction of on site water supply and waste treatment systems
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and
discharges from the system into floodwaters;
         h.   Pumping facilities for subsurface external foundation wall and
basement flood pressures;
         i.   Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water
pressure or floating debris;
         j.   Cutoff valves on sewage lines or the elimination of gravity flow
basement drains; and
         k.   Location of on site waste disposal systems so as to avoid
impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment: Materials that are buoyant,
flammable, noxious, toxic or otherwise injurious to persons or property if
transported by floodwaters are prohibited. Storage of materials and equipment
not having these characteristics is permissible only if the materials and
equipment have low damage potential and are anchored or are readily removable
from the area within the time available after forecasting and warning.
   C.   Affect On Other Property Owners: The evaluation of the effect on a
proposed use in the floodway and floodway fringe areas causing increases in
flood heights is based not just on the effect of the single use acting alone
but upon the reasonable assumption that other land owners within the floodplain
may need to be allowed to develop to an equivalent extent within the floodway
and, therefore, the accumulative effects of all such encroachments must be
considered by the city council in making any decision. Construction materials
which resist damage caused by flooding shall be used in that portion of a
structure subject to flooding.
   D.   Height, Yard And Area Restrictions: Restrictions regarding height, rear
yards, side yards, front yard setback, minimum lot area, signs, vision
clearance and parking space shall be the same as set forth in each specific
district located within the FP floodplain overlay district area. (Ord. 341, 9-
10-1996)
9-8-5: PROHIBITED USES:
It shall be unlawful to erect, alter, maintain or establish in an FP floodplain
overlay district any building, use or occupancy not permitted or allowed in the
foregoing provisions, except existing nonconforming uses may continue as herein
provided. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-8-6: NONLIABILITY PROVISIONS:
The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature from or by the city
council or the commission or by any officer or employee thereof, of the
practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed, and shall create no
liability upon or cause of action against such public body, officer or employee
for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)

9-9-1: PURPOSE:
It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are appearing
daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses possess
characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location, design,
size, method of operation, circulation and public facilities that each specific
use must be considered individually.
The commission shall hold a public hearing on each special use permit
application as specified herein. The commission may recommend approval,
conditional approval or denial of a special use permit under the conditions as
herein specified and considering such additional safeguards as will uphold the
intent of the provisions of this title. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-9-2: CONTENTS OF APPLICATION:
An application for a special use permit shall be filed with the city clerk by
at least one owner of property for which such special use is proposed. At a
minimum, the application shall contain the following information:

and height of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic access and
traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards and such other information as the commission may
require to determine if the proposed special use meets the intent and
requirements of this title; and
   G.   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property; the
effect of such elements as view, noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and
other properties in the district; and the relationship of the proposed used to
the comprehensive land use plan. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-9-3: GENERAL STANDARDS:
The commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed special use in the terms of the following standards and shall find
adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   A.   Will, in fact, constitute a special use as established on the official
schedule of district regulations for the zoning district involved;
   B.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the comprehensive land use plan and/or the
applicable zoning ordinance;
   C.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area;
   D.   Will not create a nuisance or safety hazard for neighboring properties
in terms of excessive noise or vibration, improperly directed glare or heat,
electrical interference, odors, dust or air pollutants, solid waste generation
and storage, hazardous materials or waste, excessive traffic generation or
interference with pedestrian traffic.
   E.   Will be adequately served by essential public facilities and services
such as access streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse
disposal, water and sewer service, and schools. If existing facilities are not
adequate, the developer shall show that such facilities shall be upgraded
sufficiently to serve the proposed use;
   F.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   G.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
scenic views or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of
traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
   H.   Will not generate traffic in excess of the capacity of public streets
or access points serving the proposed use and will assure adequate visibility
at traffic access points;
   I.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic
or historic feature of major importance;
   J.   Will be effectively buffered to screen adjoining properties from
adverse impacts of noise, building size and resulting shadow, traffic and
parking.
   K.   Will be compatible with the slope of the site and the capacity of the
soils and will not be in an area of natural hazards unless suitably designed to
protect lives and property. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)

the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of the zoning ordinances and regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of the applicable
zoning ordinances and regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. (Ord.
341, 9-10-1996)

peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of the applicable
zoning ordinances and regulations would deprive the applicant of rights
commonly enjoyed by other properties under the terms of applicable zoning
ordinances and regulations;
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the applicable zoning
ordinances and regulations to other lands, structures or buildings in the same
district.
   B.   A variance shall not be granted unless the commission makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it
which support conclusions that the above described standards and conditions
have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-10-3: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the commission recommend granting a variance to
allow a use not permitted under the terms of applicable zoning ordinances and
regulations in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of any applicable zoning ordinance or regulation in
said district. In recommending the granting of a variance, the commission may
recommend appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with applicable
zoning ordinances and regulations. Violation of such conditions and safeguards,
when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of the city's zoning ordinances and regulations. (Ord. 341,

permit.
   C.   Action By City Council: Within thirty (30) days after receiving the
commission's recommendation, the city council shall take final action on the
recommendation, and shall provide the applicant with written notice of its
action on the request within ten (10) days after a decision has been rendered.
   D.   Request For Hearing By Affected Persons: An "affected person" shall
mean one having an interest in real property which may be adversely affected by
the issuance or denial of a permit. Any affected person may at any time prior
to final action by the city council on an application for a variance, petition
the city council in writing to hold a second hearing on the application. After
any such hearing as may be held pursuant to such request, the city council may:
      1.   Grant or deny a permit; or
      2.   Delay such a decision for a definite period of time for further
study or hearing.
   An affected person aggrieved by a decision may, within sixty (60) days after
all remedies have been exhausted under the ordinances of the city, seek
judicial review under the procedures provided by Idaho Code 67-5240 et seq.

NONCONFORMING USES AND LOTS
SECTION:
9-11-1: Intent
9-11-2: Incompatibility Of Nonconforming Uses
9-11-3: Avoidance Of Undue Hardship
9-11-4: Single And Combination Nonconforming Lots
9-11-5: Repairs And Maintenance
9-11-6: Uses Under Special Use Provisions
9-11-1: INTENT:
It is the intent of this title to permit nonconforming uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-11-2: INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Nonconforming uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming use shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of this title by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by
the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in
the district in which such use is located. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-11-3: AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP:
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
the actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this
title or amendment thereto and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently carried on. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
9-11-4: SINGLE AND COMBINATION NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Single Nonconforming Lots Of Record: In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record  1  at the
effective date of this title or amendment thereto, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this title. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.
   B.   Nonconforming Lots Of Record In Combination: If two (2) or more lots or
a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage of this title or amendment
thereto, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this title, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this title, nor
shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or
area below the requirements stated in this title.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Of Structures And Land In Combination: If a lawful
use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land in combination,
exists at the effective date of this title or amendment thereto that would not
be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
      2.   No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any additional land
area;
      3.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land may, upon the issuance of a special use permit
by the city council, be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the
city council shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the city council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards
in accordance with other provisions of this title;
      4.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      5.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than two (2) years (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or
structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
      6.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming use of the land. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)
 
Notes
1 1. See definition in section
  9-1-4 of this title.
9-11-5: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that the cubic
content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing
in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such official. (Ord.
341, 9-10-1996)
9-11-6: USES UNDER SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS:
Any use which is permitted as a special use in a district under the terms of
this title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall,
without further action, be considered a conforming use. (Ord. 341, 9-10-1996)

9-13-4: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose and intent of this section is to encourage private
participation in comprehensive planning and allow for zoning amendments that
are designed to address the specific character of a parcel of property, the
needs of the surrounding neighborhood and the public infrastructure needs, by
placing conditions upon that zoning amendment that provide for mitigation of
the impact of development upon the community.
   B.   Authority: In the event that a requested amendment to the zoning
designation of a parcel of property will, in the opinion of the city council,
have a substantial impact on the public infrastructure or will require
buffering between the subject parcel and adjacent neighborhood if the request
were to be granted, the city council is hereby authorized to condition approval
of the zoning amendment upon a written development agreement providing for
mitigation of the impact on the infrastructure and the property surrounding the
subject parcel.
   C.   Form Of Agreement: The development agreement shall be in a form
approved by the city council. It shall specify the duration of the agreement,
the permitted uses of the property, the density or intensity of use, the
maximum height and size of proposed buildings, provisions for reservation or
dedication of land for public purposes, buffering requirements and
infrastructure improvement requirements that are necessary to mitigate the
impact of the zone change. The development agreement may include conditions,
terms, restrictions and requirements for discretionary actions, provided, that
such conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for discretionary actions
shall not prevent development of the land for the uses and to the density or
intensity of development set forth in the agreement. The agreement may provide
that construction shall be commenced within a specified time and that the
project or any phase thereof be completed within a specified time.
   D.   Recording: All development agreements shall be recorded at the expense
of the subject property owner and the terms of the agreement shall run with the
land and be binding on subsequent property owners.
   E.   Modification And Termination: Development agreements may not be amended
or terminated without the city first providing notice and holding a public
hearing pursuant to the hearing procedures for adoption of the comprehensive
plan under the local planning act.
   F.   Enforcement: If the property owner fails to comply with the terms of
the development agreement, the city council may, following notice and public
hearing, terminate the agreement and reverse the zoning designation. The city
council is also authorized to enforce the terms of the agreement through civil
action for injunctive relief.
   G.   Periodic Review: Compliance with the development agreement may be
reviewed on a period basis of not less than once every twelve (12) months from
the effective date of the development agreement following the procedures set
forth herein:
      1.   Written notice of the periodic review shall be given in writing to
the property owner of the subject property at least fifteen (15) days in
advance of the time at which the review will be conducted.
      2.   An investigation will be conducted as to whether or not there has
been good faith compliance.
      3.   If the person who is authorized by the city to conduct the
investigation finds that there has not been such compliance, written findings
shall be provided to the city administrator together with a recommendation as
to whether the development agreement should be terminated or modified or
enforced as written.
      4.   Upon receipt of the findings and recommendation, the matter shall be
placed on the council agenda for public hearing pursuant to the notice and
hearing procedures set out in the local planning act for adoption of the
comprehensive plan.
      5.   Nothing in this section is intended to preclude a review on a more
frequent basis upon the receipt by the city of a complaint that the terms of
the development agreement have been violated.
   H.   Discretionary Authority: Approval of a zoning amendment under this
section is at the discretion of the city council. (Ord. 408, 4-4-2006)

9-14-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A planned unit development (PUD) is a parcel or combination of parcels of land
which is planned and developed as a unit under single ownership or control. It
may contain one or a mixture of uses, types of buildings, as well as common
open space, clustered development and/or recreational facilities. The purpose
of the PUD process is to provide opportunity for land development that
preserves and utilizes natural topographic, geologic and scenic features;
allows a more efficient pattern of residential and commercial uses; fosters
innovative design concepts and promotes flexibility in site design; and
provides for common open space or other amenities not found in traditional lot
by lot development. The PUD process allows the city to approve modifications
from the development standards of the underlying zoning designation in order to
encourage creative design for land use development than is generally available
under conventional zoning regulations. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-2: PERMIT REQUIRED:
Every PUD requires a PUD permit. A PUD shall be subject to applicable
development requirements set forth in this code. Whenever there is a conflict
or difference between the provisions of this code, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-3: OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS:
An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property owner(s) or a
person having an existing interest in the property to be included in the PUD.
The PUD application shall be filed in the name of the recorded owner of
property included in the development. However, the application may be filed by
the holder(s) of an equitable interest in such property. In all applications,
sufficient proof that the record owner of the property consents to the
submission and processing of the application must be present prior to the
zoning official reviewing the application for completeness. The zoning official
may require the applicant to submit a title report for the subject property to
verify ownership. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-4: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Standards For Approval: The council may approve a PUD in accordance
with the following standards:
      1.   Density Formula: Density of residential areas of the PUD shall be
computed apart from the nonresidential uses (including, but not limited to,
office, commercial and public uses) of the PUD. For purposes of establishing
the density applicable to the residential portion of the PUD, actual density of
the residential area shall not exceed the number of dwelling units per acre
specified in the zoning district. Residential density in a PUD shall be
calculated by multiplying the gross residential area (gross acreage less
office, landscaped buffer strips or commercial use area) by the maximum number
of dwelling units per acre allowed for the zoning district in which the site is
located. A variety of housing types may be included in residential projects
including attached units, detached units, single-family units and multiple
units. Residential density shall not be provided for the following uses: FEMA
designated floodways; slopes over twenty five percent (25%) and public lands.
      2.   Open Space: Developed open space of at least twenty percent (20%) of
the gross area is required. (Landscaped open space is mandatory for all
developments and minimum landscape ordinance requirements will not be counted
as an amenity for the purposes of this provision.) In nonresidential zoning
districts, the applicant can request a waiver of the twenty percent (20%) open
space requirement from the city council but such waiver must require a minimum
of ten percent (10%) of open space of the gross area exclusive of required
street buffers and buffers between incompatible land uses. Such a waiver is at
the sole discretion of the city council.
      3.   Amenities: Two (2) or more of the following amenities shall be
provided as part of each PUD to ensure a public benefit:
         a.   Active open space recreational facilities of a size suitable to
meet the needs of the development. Active open space shall be defined as:
neighborhood areas that provide gathering areas for active recreation (e.g.,
such as a playground, picnic area, basketball or tennis court, swimming pool,
clubhouse, golf course, open fields, tot lot, and running/equestrian trails).
         b.   Passive open space including public pedestrian or bicycle
circulation system within the project (exclusive of required sidewalks adjacent
to public right of way) and connecting to existing or planned pedestrian or
bicycle routes outside the project, designed and constructed in accordance with
standards set forth by the city of Harrison. Passive open space shall be
defined as: neighborhood areas that provide a combination of linear open space
and scenic features (e.g., ponds, berms and provision of view corridors).
         c.   Other amenities appropriate to the size and uses of the proposed
development, as may be proposed by the applicant and approved by the city
council (e.g., natural or preserved areas).
         d.   Construction and maintenance of all amenities shall be specified
by the applicant prior to approval of the preliminary plat/final development
plan. Thereafter such maintenance and operation responsibilities of these
facilities shall be undertaken by a homeowners' association or by the city or
other governmental entity if dedicated to and officially accepted by the city
or other governmental entity.
      4.   Setbacks: Along the periphery of the PUD, setbacks shall be provided
as required by regulation of the district in which the development is located
unless an exception is provided. Where development already exists at the
periphery, the setbacks shall be aligned, where practical. Setbacks for
buildings within the interior of the site may be less than required in the
designated zoning district. Special landscape buffers between differing uses as
set forth in the landscape ordinance shall apply to PUDs. Attached structures
may be permitted in PUDs with strict compliance with the building code
requirements for party and fire separation walls. The minimum separation
between detached structures shall be ten feet (10') unless fire or building
codes require modified separation.
      5.   Driveways, Streets And Pathways: Driveways to one- and two-family
dwellings shall not be less than twenty feet (20') in width. Service driveways,
drive-through lanes and escape lanes shall have a minimum width of twelve feet
(12') per lane, without parking on either side. Publicly dedicated streets
shall be designed and constructed to city or applicable highway district
standards. Private streets may be utilized within the project with standards
that are less than public street standards subject to applicable laws and
regulations, if approved by the city council and set forth in a development
agreement.
      6.   Housing Types: A variety of housing types may be included within a
single PUD including, for example: attached units (townhomes, duplexes),
detached units (patio homes, single-family and multi-family units), regardless
of the underlying zoning classification of the site such that the overall
density limit of the zone is maintained.
      7.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking shall comply with the parking
requirements of the underlying zone. No common parking or maneuvering areas
shall be allowed within twenty feet (20') of the boundary of the PUD. All
common parking or maneuvering areas shall be buffered from adjacent properties.
The buffer area may include natural features, but must be landscaped (and may
include fencing or screen walls) with the objective of minimizing adverse
impacts to surrounding properties. In addition to the above requirements, where
on street parking is prohibited, at least one-half (1/2) additional parking
space per dwelling unit shall be provided either in approved parking bays along
the street or in an off street parking area.
      8.   Signs: Signs shall comply with the sign requirements of chapter 6 of
this title.
      9.   Stormwater Management: The management of stormwater shall conform to
the Idaho department of environmental quality and standard engineering best
management practices and any applicable stormwater management policies adopted
by the city.
      10.   Other Uses: Other types of uses, in addition to residential, may be
permitted within a single PUD (e.g., commercial or industrial) in compliance
with the provisions of this code and with the approval of the city council.
      11.   Comprehensive Plan: The PUD must meet the general objectives of the
comprehensive land use plan adopted by the city.
      12.   Streets And Utility Services: Existing and proposed streets and
utility services must be suitable and adequate for the proposed development.
      13.   Development Agreement: A development agreement shall be required
between the developer and the city which delineates commitments of the
developer to the city and of the city to the developer.
      14.   Public Hearing Requirement: The PUD is subject to the public
hearing requirements of this code.
      15.   Concurrent Review: Concurrent review of other applications may be
required. In cases where a subdivision is being proposed or would be required,
concurrent review of the detailed PUD and subdivision plat is required.
   B.   Area Size: A PUD shall have a minimum area size of eight thousand
(8,000) square feet. All land within the development shall be contiguous as
defined under Idaho Code 50-222. Parcels that are not contiguous due to
intervening streets are discouraged. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-5: DEVELOPER/APPLICANT INCENTIVES AND BENEFITS:
PUDs are intended to provide particular benefits to the public and to the
developer through a mixture of uses and integrated nature of the projects.
Public benefit is ensured by the provision of public improvements and the
amenities required by this code, and, for infill developments, by the increased
efficiency of the use of land and public services. Deviations from the
development standards and/or area requirements of the underlying zone may be
approved if the proposed uses are not detrimental to present and potential
surrounding uses and are not detrimental to the health, safety and general
welfare of the public. Any variation from the basic zoning district
requirements must be warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the
preliminary plat and/or final development plan. The commission and council may
consider lands that include intervening streets on a case by case basis. The
commission may recommend waiver or deferral of the minimum lot size, and the
council may grant such waiver or deferral for hotels which meet the definition
of "hotel" in section
9-1-4 of this title, or resorts which meet the definition of "resort" in
section
9-1-4 of this title, and conforms to all other requirements of the "mixed use
district (MU)" located in section
9-2-2 of this title. To provide the developer with an incentive to utilize the
PUD process, the following deviations from conventional development standards
may be incorporated into a PUD proposal:
   A.   Housing Types: A variety of housing types may be included in the
planned development.
   B.   Minimum Lot Size: The minimum lot size for each building and setbacks
for buildings within the project may be reduced below those normally required
for the zoning district.
   C.   Use Exceptions: Twenty percent (20%) of the site may include uses not
normally permitted in the designated zoning district.
   D.   Clustering: Buildings may be clustered to preserve scenic, historic,
aesthetic or environmentally sensitive areas in the natural state, or to
consolidate small open spaces into larger, more usable areas for common use and
enjoyment.
   E.   Conditions Of Approval: The conditions of the approval established for
a PUD shall be consistently applied to all phases of the development, unless
specifically agreed to otherwise during the approval process.
   F.   Land For Public Use: A residential density bonus may be given for
dedications of land for public use such as: school, park, library, public
utility, fire station or recreational facility, which are provided to the
public entity by donation or at a cost less than, or equal to, the applicant's
predevelopment cost for that land.
   G.   Increased Residential Density: The commission may recommend, and the
council may authorize, an increased residential density of up to five percent
(5%) of the allowable number of residential dwelling units that are allowed in
the designated zoning district for each of the following:
      1.   Landscaping, street design and streetscape, open spaces (active and
passive uses) and plazas, use of required landscaping, pedestrian walkway
design and distribution, and recreation uses.
      2.   Siting visual focal points; use of existing physical features such
as topography, view, sun and wind orientation; motorized and nonmotorized
vehicle circulation pattern; physical environment; variation in building
setbacks and building clustering.
      3.   Design features; street sections (e.g., frontage and backage roads),
architectural styles, harmonious use of materials; parking areas augmented by
landscape features; and varied use of housing styles and housing options (e.g.,
estate homes, townhouses).
      4.   Permanent protection of significant natural features, view sheds and
historic sites and structures.
   H.   Dwelling Units Allowed: Residential density bonuses for all incentives
listed in subsection G of this section may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of
the allowable number of residential dwelling units that are allowed in the
designated zoning district. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-6: OPEN SPACE/COMMON AREA AMENITIES:
A minimum of twenty percent (20%), unless otherwise approved, of the gross land
area developed in any residential PUD project shall be reserved for common open
space and recreational facilities unless a waiver is granted pursuant to
section
9-14-5 of this chapter.
   A.   Construction And Maintenance: The required amount of common open space
land reserved under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners
of the project area for the use of each owner who buys property within the
development or be dedicated to the public and retained as common open space for
parks, recreation and related uses. Public utility and similar easements and
rights of way for watercourses and other similar channels are not acceptable
for common open space dedication unless such land or right of way is usable as
a trail or other similar purpose and approved by the city council.
   The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified
by the developer before approval of the final PUD plan. The development must
have a perpetual agreement to maintain the open space and cannot dissolve this
clause in the master declaration or covenants, conditions and restrictions.
   B.   Open Space: Unless otherwise approved, not less than twenty percent
(20%) of the total gross area of a residential PUD shall be retained as
permanent open space and shall not include strips of less than fifteen feet
(15') in width unless designed to accommodate a water feature such as a pond or
stream. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of land area of a PUD devoted to
multiple-family residential uses shall consist of open space. A waiver of the
open space requirement may not be granted for a PUD devoted to multiple-family
residential uses. Of this required open space, portions may be "common area"
used for recreational or other collective enjoyment by occupants of the
development, privately owned properties dedicated by easements to assure that
open space will be permanent, and lands developed as active recreational areas
or preserved in their natural state when such areas contain unique natural
assets such as groves of trees, ponds, rivers or streambeds.
   C.   Dimension: In order to be functionally usable, open space should exist
in quantities of some minimum dimension. Therefore, the areas of each parcel of
open space to be used for active recreational use shall have a size and shape
consistent with the planned use.
   D.   Location: Open spaces shall be distributed within projects in locations
near the dwelling units of the people they are intended to serve. A minimum of
fifty percent (50%) of dwelling units shall be located within one thousand feet
(1,000') of designated open space within the planned unit development.
   E.   Open Space Shared Or Public: Land indicated as open space, common
areas, amenities (tennis courts, playgrounds, swimming pool, etc.), streets and
sidewalks shall be shown on the preliminary plan and provide on the plan that
they be permanently maintained as such either by a homeowners' association
which provides private covenants, an agreement with the developer, or if
suitable and mutually agreeable, by public dedications.
   F.   Easements: Easements for pedestrian/bicycle/equestrian pathways in
accordance with the city's comprehensive plan and pathway plan.
   G.   Amenities: Amenities shall be provided as a part of each planned unit
development. A minimum of two (2) amenities shall be provided within a
development. As the project size increases the number and/or size of the
amenities shall also increase proportionally. These amenities may include, but
not be limited to, any of the following:
      1.   Private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool, tennis
court, barbecue area or playground of a size appropriate to meet needs of the
development.
      2.   Provision for public access to any public open space, park or lake/
river greenbelt.
      3.   Publicly dedicated land in a PUD for facilities such as school, fire
station, well site, public park, and public recreational facility.
      4.   Additional open space for parkways, boulevards, or other features
designed to mitigate vehicle/traffic impact.
      5.   Other amenities as approved by the commission and council. (Ord.
430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-7: UTILITY REQUIREMENTS:
Underground utility distribution and service facilities, including, but not
limited to: telecommunications, water, sewer, irrigation, cable, and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of all planned unit developments,
appurtenances to these systems which must be effectively screened. (Ord. 430,
12-16-2008)
9-14-8: ARRANGEMENT OF USES:
The plan of the PUD project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious
design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for
internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and
facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas. All
areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate improvement
or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a neat and
orderly manner. Guidelines for commercial and residential PUDs are as follows:
   A.   Commercial: When proposed within a nonresidential area the plan of the
project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design of buildings,
and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal traffic
circulation, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may be
necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint of
the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas. A twenty foot (20') wide
buffer area should be used along the exterior boundary of a PUD when abutting
residential areas or uses.
   B.   Residential: When residential projects include commercial uses as
allowed in this chapter and are located within a residentially designated area
the commercial uses should be designed and scaled to primarily serve the
residential portions of the project in which they are located and focus
internally to the development. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on
the perimeter of the commercial areas abutting residential areas. Commercial
areas shall not be located on the exterior of the project site so as not to
abut existing residential uses. A twenty foot (20') wide buffer area should be
used along the exterior boundary of a PUD when similar uses or like sized lots
are not provided. (Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-9: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A PUD:
   A.   Prior to the submission of an application for a PUD, the applicant
shall contact the zoning official or their designee and arrange for a
preapplication conference. The purpose of this conference is to provide
guidance to the developer in preparing the application. Therefore, the
developer should request the meeting well before preparing the application
materials. A draft site plan and preliminary plat map (if required) shall be
available at the preapplication meeting.
   B.   A PUD application may be submitted and processed as a concept plan. The
applicant must specify the application and site plan for which approval is
being requested. A concept approval is a statement by the city of Harrison that
a general development plan including the arrangements of uses, density,
location of major streets, open spaces, utilities, etc., is acceptable. A
concept review allows the applicant to obtain approval of a general development
plan without incurring the expense of detailed building plans until after
concept approval. It provides the developer and the city with guidelines for
the design of each phase of the project. Supporting information may be required
by the zoning official on issues of major importance for the project prior to
deeming the application complete.
   Each phase of a concept approval requires detailed subdivision plat approval
through a new application, fee and public hearing. The only exception to the
detailed subdivision plat requirement is single-family dwellings proposed as
the primary use within a development. The single-family dwelling portion of the
project shall be reviewed in detail under subdivision requirements of this
code.
   C.   Every PUD requires an application, including all plans and information
required by this code. Phasing plans shall be included if the project is to be
phased. The application is subject to the public hearing requirements of this
code.
   D.   Concurrent review of other applications may be required as determined
by the zoning official or their designee. In cases where subdivision platting
would be necessary, concurrent review of the PUD application may be required.
(Ord. 430, 12-16-2008)
9-14-10: APPLICATION FOR A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   General Application Requirements: An application for approval of a
proposed PUD shall be made to the city clerk and shall include all information

additional building sites are created and where the resultant tracts comply
with zoning ordinance requirements 1 .
      5.   Mere recordation of legal descriptions, without actual conveyance of
the land described.
      6.   Any lot or lots forming a part of any subdivision created and
recorded prior to the effective date of this title.

10-1-4: SUBDIVISION PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED:
No person shall carry out actions which constitute the subdivision of land, as
defined by this title and/or state law, without first complying with the
provisions of this title and, when applicable, state platting law 1 ; nor shall

comply shall be subject to enforcement in accordance with provisions of this
title. (Ord. 381, 8-29-2002)
 
Notes
1 1. IC § 50-1301 et seq.
10-1-5: SUBDIVISION REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Application: Any person seeking to subdivide land within the city shall
make application to the city clerk on forms provided by the city and pay all
applicable fees at the time of the application. The applicant shall be
responsible for providing names and addresses of property owners who must
receive notice pursuant to this title.
   B.   Minor Subdivisions: Proposals for minor subdivisions shall be heard by
the city council by way of an established comment period of at least fifteen
(15) days following confirmation of delivery, via return receipt mailing, of
notice to adjacent property owners. The proposed plat or record of survey must
be provided at least five (5) days prior to the notice period. No formal public
hearing shall be required in such matters unless ordered by the city council. A
record of survey prepared by a licensed surveyor or engineer may be utilized in
circumstances where one lot or parcel is divided into two (2) parcels by a
straight boundary line.
   C.   Major Subdivisions:
      1.   Proposals for major subdivisions shall be approved only after public
hearing before the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning
commission shall schedule a public hearing on an application for a major
subdivision within sixty (60) days of the date of the application. Notice of
the hearing shall be published and provided to all property owners within three
hundred feet (300') of the proposed subdivision no later than fifteen (15) days
in advance of the hearing. The proposed plat must be filed with the city clerk
no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. The planning and
zoning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council to approve or
deny a major subdivision application after the public hearing is held. For
subdivisions of eight (8) or fewer lots, the city council need not hold a
public hearing. For subdivisions of nine (9) or more lots, the city council
shall conduct a public hearing utilizing the same notice procedures a set forth
above.
      2.   The city council may require major subdivisions to go through a two
(2) step procedure, first considering a preliminary plat and later considering
a final plat. Under such procedure, the planning and zoning commission will not
review the final plat nor will a public hearing be required when the final plat
is considered.
   D.   Action Taken: Final approval will not be granted until the city council
has approved all final plans for a subdivision. Upon receipt of a
recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, the application shall
be put on the agenda for the next city council meeting. The city council may
approve the subdivision request, deny such request or approve the request with
conditions. The developer shall mitigate any negative impacts the development
may have on adjacent property or community services. If necessary, off site
improvements may be required to mitigate such impacts. The city shall require
bonding for public improvements not constructed and accepted prior to sale of
lots.
   E.   Changes After Final Approval: After approval of the plans for a
subdivision, any significant changes must be submitted to the planning and
zoning commission and the city council for reapproval.
   F.   Conditional Approval: Final approval of the preliminary plat or final
plat by the city council may be conditional, subject to applicable law and
zoning regulations, to ensure that the subdivision is compatible with adjacent
developments, adequate access is provided and services are provided. For major
subdivisions, a subdivision development agreement will provide, in writing, for
commitments made by the developer as well as by the city. (Ord. 381, 8-29-2002)
10-1-6: PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS:
Plans must meet all specifications of the city ordinances and must be presented
to, and approved by, the city council before any work is done. Within ninety
(90) days of completion of construction, as built plans and inspection reports,
certified by a professional engineer, shall be provided to the city except
where a lesser period is stipulated by state law. (Ord. 381, 8-29-2002)
10-1-7: INSPECTIONS:
The city engineer, or such other person as the city shall designate, shall
inspect the subdivision site and the subdivider and the subdivider's
contractors, subcontractors, employees and agents shall cooperate with such
inspections. City inspections shall be made as follows:
   A.   At the discretion of the city, upon twenty four (24) hours' notice to
the subdivider.
   B.   Before the covering of sewer, water or other buried utility
installations. Subdivider shall provide the city twenty four (24) hours' notice
before such installations are covered.
   C.   Upon completion of the subdivision or the completion of a phase of
public works construction that involves cessation of work for more than six (6)
months.
   D.   At reasonable times upon the request of the subdivider. (Ord. 381, 8-
29-2002)
10-1-8: CONDITIONS OF SUBDIVISION:
   A.   Expiration Of Subdivision Plan Approval: Subdivision plan approval
shall be effective for twelve (12) months. The subdivider may request an
extension of subdivision plan approval for one additional twelve (12) month
period by submitting the request, in writing, to the city council prior to the
scheduled expiration deadline.
   B.   Change Of Ownership:
      1.   Notice To City: Subdividers must give written notice to the city
upon a change in the ownership of the subdivision taking place after
application for subdivision approval.
      2.   Review: Upon any change in ownership of the subdivision taking place
after the approval of any aspect of the subdivision, the city may review that
approval to see if new circumstances arise with the change in ownership that
warrant withdrawal of approval or a change in the conditions of any conditional
approval. Upon good cause, the city may withdraw any approval or amend the
conditions of any conditional approval when a subdivision has changed ownership
after that approval.
   C.   Fees: The fees for preliminary subdivision plat and final subdivision
plat shall be set by resolution of the city council.
   All costs associated with providing public notice and hearings shall be
reimbursed to the city by the applicant.
   The city council is further authorized to adopt fees by resolution for
services associated with review and inspection of subdivision plan and
proposals. (Ord. 413, 9-6-2006)
10-1-9: PENALTIES:
Failure to comply with the provisions of this title shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Each day such violation exists may be considered a separate
offense, subject to the penalty as provided in the general penalty in section
1-3-1 of this code. In addition to the criminal penalties above, the city may
proceed against the violator in civil court for both prohibitive and mandatory
injunctions requiring the violator to conform to this title. In the event the
city prevails, the violator shall be responsible for all platting costs,
including a reasonable sum for attorney fees. Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city council or any other public official or private citizen from
taking such legal action as may be necessary to restrain or prevent any
violation of this title or of the Idaho Code. (Ord. 381, 8-29-2002; amd. 2004
Code)
