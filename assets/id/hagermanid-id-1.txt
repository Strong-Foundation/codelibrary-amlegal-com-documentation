city representative assigned to read the water meters shall have the right to
enter upon any premises connected with the public water system at all
reasonable hours to determine that there is compliance with the provisions of
this chapter. If conflict is noted, the owner of said premises or his agent

on actual operation, maintenance, replacement, and financing expenses, and/or
on significant changes in the total number of equivalent users and/or the total
daily flow. All changes in user charges applicable to this chapter shall be
computed by the methods outlined herein.
   D.   User Request For Rate Change: Any water user, who feels his user charge
is unjust and inequitable as applied to his premises within the spirit and
intent of the foregoing provisions, may make written application to the city
requesting a review of his user charge. Said written request shall, where
necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow of water in comparison
with the values upon which the charge is based, including how the measurements
or estimates were made. Any flow measurements shall be approved in detail by
the city and/or its engineer. Review of the request by the city shall determine
if it is substantiated or not, including recommended further study of the

customers. If said bill is not paid within five (5) days, a twenty four (24)
hour shut off notice shall be given prior to termination of water services. In
case service is discontinued for delinquency, it shall not be restored until
the delinquency is paid, or until arrangements for payment satisfactory to the
city clerk-treasurer have been made, together with a fee as set by resolution
of the city council for discontinuing and restoring service. Said fee shall be
payable whenever a service trip is made for the purpose of discontinuing
service because of nonpayment. (Ord. 984, 7-5-1995; amd. 2010 Code)

measured edge to edge. In cases where it is not practical to maintain a ten
foot (10') separation, the reviewing authority may allow deviation on a case by
case basis, if supported by data from the design engineer. Such deviation may
allow installation of the water main closer to a sewer; provided, that the
water main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf
located on one side of the sewer at such an elevation that the bottom of the
water main is at least eighteen inches (18") above the top of the sewer.
      3.   Crossings: Water mains crossing sewers shall be laid to provide a
minimum vertical distance of eighteen inches (18") between the outside of the
water main and the outside of the sewer. This shall be the case where the water
main is either above or below the sewer. At crossings, one full length of water
pipe shall be located so both joints will be as far from the sewer as possible.
Special structural support for the water and sewer pipes may be required.
      4.   Exception: The city must specifically approve any variance from the
requirements of subsections J2 and J3 of this section when it is impossible to
obtain the specified separation distance.
      5.   Force Mains: There shall be at least a ten foot (10') horizontal
separation between water mains and sanitary sewer force mains. There shall be
an eighteen inch (18") vertical separation at crossings as required in
subsection J3 of this section.

lines shall, wherever possible, be located on opposite sides of the street.
Preferably, water lines shall be located thirteen feet (13') west or north of
the street centerline and the sanitary water lines at thirteen feet (13') east
or south of the street centerline. Where storm drains are needed, these shall
preferably be located along the street centerline. The above referenced
locations and dimensions may be varied to accommodate unusual circumstances.
   O.   Drawings: All drawings shall be on linen or Mylar in ink and of such
quality that they clearly show the dimensions, locations, sizes, etc., of all
facilities represented thereon. All main lines, valves, fire hydrants, building
service lines, etc., shall be clearly shown and identified by name and by
station or other means of horizontal location. Water lines shall be shown in
both plane and profile unless the length of said water line or water line
extension is so short that an engineer designated by the city waives this
requirement. If a profile of the water line is not provided, it shall be
located in the vertical plane by elevations on the flow line of the pipe at
intervals as the city engineer may require. Drawings shall be drawn on a scale
of one inch equals fifty feet (1" = 50') unless the amount of detail,
topography, etc., necessitates their being drawn on a larger scale (i.e., 1" =
30') to provide the clarity and completeness needed on the drawings.

wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the superintendent that such
wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; have
an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or otherwise endanger life, limb,
public property or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability of these wastes, the superintendent will give consideration to
such factors as to quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of
the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent
factors. The substances prohibited are:

composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the superintendent for such materials.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentrations as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      8.   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
      9.   Materials which exert or cause:
         a.   Unusual concentrations or inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         b.   Excessive BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements
in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.

slugs.
      10.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirement of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged into
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or the characteristics
enumerated in this subsection, and which, in the judgment of the
superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may:
         a.   Reject the wastes;
         b.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewer;
         c.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         d.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of section
8-2-3 of this chapter.

Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   G.   Owner Install Control Manhole: When required by the superintendent, the
owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes
shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters
and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the
owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
   H.   Sampling, Control Manholes: All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this section
shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods
For The Examination Of Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public
Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.)
   I.   Acceptance Of Special Agreements: No statement in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment
therefor by the industrial concern. (1996 Code § 6-4-7)
8-2-8: PRIVIES, CESSPOOLS PROHIBITED; EXCEPTION; PERMIT:

The planning commission shall consider variances to the terms of this title
which will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title will result
in unnecessary hardship and under such conditions that the spirit of this title
shall be observed and substantial justice done. A variance shall not be
considered a right or special privilege, but may be granted to an applicant
only upon showing of undue hardship, not caused by his own or a previous
owner's actions, because of characteristics of the site and that the variance
is not in conflict with the public interest. In acting upon such variance, the
planning commission shall make a full investigation and shall only recommend
granting a variance upon finding that the following are true:
   A.   That the granting of the variance will not be in conflict with the
spirit and intent of the comprehensive general plan for the city, and will not
effect a change in zoning.
   B.   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions, applicable to the property involved, or the intended use thereof,
which do not apply generally to the property or class of use in the district,
so that a denial of the relief sought will result in:
      1.   Undue loss of value of the property.
      2.   Inability to preserve the property rights of the owner.
      3.   The prevention of reasonable enjoyment of any property right of the
owner.
   C.   The granting of such relief will not be materially detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements
of other property owners, or the quiet enjoyment of such property or
improvement. (Ord. 989, 6-4-1996)
10-6-3: FILING OF APPLICATION; REQUIREMENTS:

external boundaries of the land being considered. (Ord. 989, 6-4-1996)

commission shall transmit its recommendations for approval or disapproval to
the city council. (Ord. 989, 6-4-1996)
