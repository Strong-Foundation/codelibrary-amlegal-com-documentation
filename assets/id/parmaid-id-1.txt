1-7-5: CODE OF ETHICS:
1-7-5-1: DECLARATION OF POLICY:
The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees
conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed.
The people have a right to expect that every public official and employee will
conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and
respect for the government he represents. Such confidence and respect can best
be promoted if every public official and employee, whether paid or unpaid, and
whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:
   A.   Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness and equality
under the law; and
   B.   Avoid both actual and potential conflicts between their private self-
interest and the public interest.
To help public officials and employees achieve these goals is one of the
objectives of the code. The other objective is based on the proposition that no
man can serve two (2) masters, nor should he attempt to do so. Therefore, this
code proposes to relieve him of the impossible task of judging himself.
Instead, the code places judgment in the hands of an impartial board of ethics
1  which will review the facts and measure them by the yardstick of public
morality established by the code. (Ord. 365, 3-27-1978)

4-4-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho Code 46-1020 through 46-1024,
authorized local government units to adopt a floodplain map and floodplain
management ordinance that identifies floodplains and that sets forth minimum
development requirements in floodplains that are designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city
council does ordain the following provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 563, 4-11-
2011)
4-4-2: FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 411, 4-27-1987)
   B.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas in special flood hazard;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 563, 4-11-2011)
4-4-3: METHODS OF ACCOMPLISHING PURPOSE:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to erosion hazards or which result in damaging increase in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. 411, 4-27-1987)
4-4-4: INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION:
   A.   Jurisdiction And Interpretation: This chapter shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City. In the
interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
   B.   Conflicting Laws And Agreements: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and any ordinance, easement, covenant
or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 411, 4-27-1987)
4-4-5: COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
No structure or land shall be constructed, located, extended, converted or
altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 411, 4-27-1987)

parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
   APPEAL: A request for the building inspector's interpretation of any
provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH Zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one foot to three feet (1' -
3'); a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is
characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land on a floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "regulatory flood".
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The water surface elevation during the base
flood in relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation (BFE) is
depicted on the FIRM to the nearest foot and in the FIS to the nearest 0.1
foot. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area, it may
be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or other
source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies.
   BASEMENT: The portion of a structure including crawl space with its floor
subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures, or the construction of additions or substantial
improvements to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of
mobile homes; mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of materials,
specifically including the construction of dikes, berms and levees. The term
"development" does not include the operation, cleaning, maintenance or repair
of any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or
drainage works that is performed or authorized by the owner thereof pursuant to
lawful rights and obligations.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the national flood insurance program.
   FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered
by floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report by the Federal Insurance
Administration of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) evaluating
flood hazards and containing flood profiles, floodway boundaries and water
surface elevations of the base flood.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial and complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that corresponds to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance annual flood (base flood), plus any
increase in flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus one foot (1') of
freeboard. Therefore the flood protection elevation for the City of Parma is
equal to BFE plus allowed floodway elevation plus one foot (1') of freeboard.
   FLOODPLAIN: The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the
regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe 1 .
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse
and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot (1') as shown on the flood insurance rate map.
   FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for

adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation of a
basement, footings, piers or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: A. Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The market value of the structure should be:
1. The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial
repair or improvement; or
2. In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
occurring.
   B.   The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or
local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code specifications which are solely necessary
to assure safe living conditions, or
2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited hereby.

Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
4-4-11C of this chapter.
      4.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must
meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection A2 of this section.
      5.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood
level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).
   C.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within
Zones A1-30, AH and AE, which meet one of the following location criteria,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the finish floor
elevation of the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot (1') above
the base flood elevation and be securely anchored by methods constructed in
conformance with sections
 5-4-1 through
5-4-4 of this Code:
         a.   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
         b.   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
         c.   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or

flood protection elevation or one foot (1') above the level of the base flood
elevation, whichever is higher; or
         b.   The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by
reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength) of no less than thirty six inches (36") above the highest adjacent
grade.
   D.   Recreational Vehicle Requirements: All recreational vehicles in Zones
A1-30, AH and AE to be placed on a site must:
      1.   Meet all the requirements for new construction as set forth in
sections
4-4-9-1 and

   E.   Elevation Certificates: Elevation certificates shall be required for
all structures in the SFHA, special flood hazard area issued by FEMA, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and shall comply with all standards set
forth in this chapter. When completing elevation certificates on properties
removed from SFHA, use base flood elevation insurance prior to removal from
SFHA.
   F.   Setback: All buildings shall be set back a minimum of fifty feet (50')
from the floodway line except that when the area of special flood hazard
boundary is fifty feet (50') or less from the floodway line, the boundary line
shall be the setback line.
   G.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due
to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and
erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
      1.   No Rise: Encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, are prohibited unless
certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood. If this section is satisfied,
development within the floodway shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Mitigation To Achieve No Rise: Compensating excavation in accordance
with an engineered plan for orderly conveyance of floodwater, or equivalent
mitigating measures may be performed in the floodway when certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect. Mitigation design shall include
provisions to prevent relocation or diversion of flow paths from causing
increased jeopardy to any off site property at any level of flooding from the
1-year flood up to the base flood. Provisions shall be made in a recorded
development agreement between the City and the applicant to maintain excavated
areas prone to fill from sediment and other debris as follows:
         a.   A plan and schedule for the future maintenance of the floodway
for the period of the expected lifetime thereof and a cost estimate therefor
prepared by a licensed professional engineer in the State, together with a
proposed method for funding the same including, but not limited to, the
creation and maintenance of a Reserve Fund for that purpose, shall be submitted
to the City Council for review and approval prior to the execution of the final
plat by the City. The location of the floodway to be maintained shall be
clearly depicted on the face of the final plat.
         b.   A restrictive covenant for maintenance of the floodway shall be
recorded at the time of recording the plat which said covenant shall create a
homeowners'/property owners' association or substantially similar entity and
make provision for the perpetual maintenance of the floodway. Said restrictive
covenant shall also provide that the covenant shall run with the land and that
said covenant cannot be modified or the homeowners'/property owners'
association or other entity cannot be dissolved without the express consent of
the City.
         c.   The Council may, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
order the owners or the entity responsible for the maintenance of the floodway
to undertake such maintenance activities as it may determine are necessary to
protect the public health, safety and welfare and make such expenditures from
the funds reserved therefor as may be required thereby; and the owner or
responsible entity shall, as a condition of approval of floodway excavation, be
deemed to have agreed to comply with any such order and to reimburse the City
all its costs, including attorney fees, incurred in obtaining or enforcing any
such order. Any order entered by the Council pursuant to this subsection may be
enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction and the City shall be entitled to
recover its costs and attorney fees incurred in connection therewith.
      3.   Emergency Access: Where setback from the floodway line is less than
one hundred feet (100') but more than fifty feet (50'), compensating measures
shall be designed to protect a fifty foot (50') wide access strip for emergency
construction equipment. Compensating measures shall be constructed as designed
and certified by a professional engineer.
      4.   Parks And Open Spaces: In the design of public and private parks and
open space areas, fixed structures or equipment that would impede floodwaters
shall not be permitted within the floodway.
      5.   Access: Any nonfloodway area surrounded by floodway shall be
accessed by at least one road with suitable structures or culverts to pass
floodwaters. If a bridge is required, it shall be elevated one foot (1') above
the base flood elevation, have scour resistant footings extending to five feet
(5') below the bottom of the channel and be capable of supporting an H-15 load
as defined by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO).
   H.   Map And Narrative Required: All subdivision proposals and development
permit applications shall provide a map and detailed narrative describing any
abutting or on site manmade topographic features, current or proposed, that
increase flood damage potential above the natural level, including road fills
and other manmade embankments, prior stream channelization, existing and/or
proposed landscaping features, and evident agricultural land leveling that has
altered the floodplain from its original topography.
   I.   Fill Requirements: For fill placed in the regulatory special flood
hazard area:
      1.   The slope of fill adjacent to the floodway line, hereinafter called
the floodway boundary slope, shall not be steeper than five horizontal to one
vertical (5:1). Where a five to one (5:1) slope is not feasible due to lot
dimensions, compensating measures to protect against floodway encroachment
through erosion shall be constructed as designed and certified by a
professional engineer, architect, or landscape architect.
      2.   The floodway boundary slope shall be maintained with adequate ground
cover to prevent erosion.
   J.   Roadways And Manholes: Roadways and manholes within the regulatory
floodplain shall be a minimum of one-half foot (0.5') above base flood
elevation at centerline and manhole ring respectively.
   K.   Flow Paths Maintained: New roads built above the base flood elevation
shall not block or restrict conveyance of floodwater into sections of the
floodplain that may be cut off by the proposed road and shall have culverts or
bridges for flood conveyance paths.
   L.   Open Areas: Except for required berms, open areas such as parks, golf
courses, greenbelt areas, parking lots, etc., within the area of special flood
hazard shall be designed and operated so that they may flood and maintain
existing natural flood paths for waters during the base flood event.
   M.   Flood Study: When a new flood study is provided by the developer:
      1.   The study shall be performed using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Hydrologic Engineering Center's HEC-2, HEC-RAS (river analysis system), or
equivalent programs to calculate water surface elevations.
      2.   Describe methods to detain drainage contribution to the base flood
event discharge.
      3.   The study report shall include field survey data and relevant bench
marks used as bases of calculations as cross sections, stream profile and plan
showing cross section locations.
      4.   The study report shall attach HEC-2, HEC-RAS, or equivalent input
and output reports as an appendix.
      5.   Any floodway or regulatory floodplain modification shall not be
effective until approved by FEMA.
      6.   The study shall include a reach of stream extending beyond the
property boundaries of the development upstream and downstream as required to
comply with FEMA guidelines.
      7.   Demonstrate that the cumulative effect of any proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1')
at any point.
   N.   Critical Facilities: Critical facilities shall not be allowed within
any special flood hazard area, including areas designated as subject to
inundation by the 0.2 percent annual chance flood event, also known as the 500-
year flood and shown as shaded Zone X areas on FIRM maps. (Ord. 593, 5-13-2019)
4-4-9-3: PROVISIONS FOR FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
 4-4-7 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
   A.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, are prohibited unless a hydraulic analysis
has been performed and certified by a professional engineer in the State of
Idaho as follows:
      1.   The hydraulic analysis shall determine and document that
improvements in the floodway will not obstruct flood flows and will not result
in a rise in base flood elevation upstream or adjacent to the site.
      2.   The hydraulic analysis shall determine and document that grading,
channel improvements, bridge and culvert replacements that remove an
obstruction do not cause increases in downstream flood flows.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator may make the encroachment determination
for minor projects, such as projects that do not increase the natural grade
(e.g., paving a driveway or parking lot at existing grade open fences and small
isolated obstructions such as mailbox or telephone pole).
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section
4-4-9. (Ord. 567, 4-23-2012)
4-4-10: VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Variance:
      1.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the City Clerk on
a form provided by the City of Parma and include at a minimum the same
information required for a development permit and an explanation for the basis
for the variance request.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the variance
request will be set for public hearing at the next City Council meeting in
which time is available for the matter to be heard.
      3.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be published
in the official newspaper of the City of Parma at least fifteen (15) days prior
to the hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice shall
be provided to all adjoining property owners.
      4.   The burden to show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   B.   Criteria For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances may be issued upon:
         a.   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      5.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
   C.   Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance
shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and
denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice
along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its
lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
   D.   Appeals: The City Council shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the Floodplain Administrator.
      1.   An appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within fourteen (14)
days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure
to exhaust administrative remedies and a waiver of the applicant's right to
appeal. The appeal must set out the interpretation of the Floodplain
Administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts relied upon by the
appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in the interpretation.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled for
the next available City Council meeting to be heard. The City Council shall
consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards
specified in other sections of this ordinance, including:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (11)   The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   E.   Decision: The City Council decision on appeal shall be in writing and
set out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
(Ord. 567, 4-23-2012)
4-4-11: CITY ENGINEER; ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES:
The City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter
by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
Duties of the City Engineer shall include, but not be limited to:
   A.   Permit Review:
      1.   Review all development permit applications to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review proposed developments to determine that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required, and require that copies of such permits
be provided and maintained on file.
      3.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of subsection
4-4-9-3A of this chapter are met.
      4.   Where interpretation is needed of the exact location of boundaries
of the areas of special flood hazard including regulatory floodway (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions) the City Engineer or his designee shall make the
interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
chapter.
   B.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with section
 4-4-7 of this chapter, the City Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal,
State or other source in order to administer sections
4-4-9-2 and
4-4-9-3 of this chapter.
   C.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
      1.   For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the Floodplain Administrator an as built certification
of the floor elevation or floodproofing level, using appropriate FEMA elevation
or floodproofing certificate, immediately after the lowest floor or
floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for nonresidential
structures, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same.
Elevations shall reference vertical datum on the effective FIRM.
      2.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:

upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00)
or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both, for each violation

5-1-3: ZONING DISTRICTS PURPOSE STATEMENT:
The following zoning districts and related purpose statements are hereby
established:
   A.   R-1 Single-Family Residential: The purpose of the R-1 (single-family
residential) zone is to have land area set aside by zoning procedures and in
accordance with the comprehensive plan to preserve and enhance predominantly
single-family living areas at a low density standard of six (6) dwelling units
per acre or less. Such areas are to have a full range of urban services
available or projected to be established to enable lot sizes, development
designs and other development criteria to be properly met.
   B.   R-2 Combined Medium Density Residential: The purpose of the R-2
(combined medium density residential) zone is to provide medium density,
residential development areas of ten (10) dwelling units per acre or less
located primarily in older urban neighborhoods and adjacent to shopping,
recreational and cultural facilities. Medium density development concentrations
should have a full range of community services and facilities available or
projected for establishment.
   C.   R-3 Multiple-Family High Density Residential: The purpose of the R-3
(multiple-family residential) zone is to provide areas by zoning procedures and
in accordance with the comprehensive plan for medium to high density
residential development of sixteen (16) dwelling units per acre or less. This
type of zoning pattern is intended to provide transition or buffer areas
between commercial uses and less intense activities and to provide places for
higher density uses in selected places of the city's neighborhoods and
communities.
   D.   C-1 Neighborhood Commercial: The purpose of the C-1 (neighborhood
commercial) zone is to provide distinct zones by zoning procedures and in
accordance with the comprehensive plan regulated to provide local commercial
service needs primarily located at selected places at the perimeter of low
density residential neighborhoods. This zoning district is intended to restrict
incompatible uses which may be better located in the community or service
oriented shopping areas due to the size of the shopping center, location within
the community, residential neighborhood areas being served and other factors.
   E.   C-2 Community/Service Commercial: The purpose of the C-2 (community/
service commercial) zone is to establish district zones by zoning procedures
and in accordance with the comprehensive plan regulated to fulfill general
shopping retail and service needs including central business area preferences.
   F.   M-1 Light Industrial: The purpose of the M-1 (light industrial) zone is
to provide areas by zoning procedures and in accordance with the comprehensive
plan which encourage the grouping together of light industrial uses capable of
being operated under such standards as to location, appearance of buildings and
the treatment of the land about them so that they will be unobtrusive and not
unreasonably detrimental to surrounding commercial or residential uses.
   G.   M-2 Heavy Industrial: The purpose of the M-2 (heavy industrial) zone is
to provide areas by zoning procedures and in accordance with the comprehensive
plan which encourage suitable areas in which heavy industrial uses may locate,
substantially free or buffered from residential, or retail commercial
activities. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-1-4: OFFICIAL ZONING MAPS AND THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN:
   A.   The boundaries of zoning districts shall be established and clearly
indicated upon the official zoning map which is hereby adopted as part of this
title.
   B.   All amendments to the official zoning map shall follow procedures set
forth in this title.
   C.   Areas are to be classified according to the established zoning
districts and shall give due consideration to the need for conformity with the
adopted comprehensive plan and its stated goals and objectives. (Ord. 527, 3-
14-2005)
5-1-5: CLARIFICATION OF AMBIGUOUS ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainties exist as to the boundaries of any zoning district as shown
upon any zoning map or part thereof, the following rules shall apply:
   A.   Where any such boundary line is indicated as following a street, alley
or public way, it shall be construed as following the centerline thereof.
   B.   Where a boundary line is indicated as approximately following a lot
line, such lot line shall be construed to be the boundary.
   C.   Where zoning district boundaries are indicated so that they are
approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, such
boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the official zoning map. If no distance is given,
such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the
official zoning map.
   D.   Where a boundary line divides a lot or crosses unsubdivided property,
the location of such boundary shall be construed as nearly as possible to its
depiction on the official zoning map. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-1-6: ANNEXATION OF UNINCORPORATED AREA:
Concurrently or immediately following the adoption of an ordinance of
annexation, the city council (referred to in this title as "council") shall
amend the plan and, if necessary, the official zoning map. (Ord. 527, 3-14-
2005)

5-3-1: DUTIES OF THE PLANNING AND ZONING ADMINISTRATOR:
The council may appoint a planning and zoning administrator for the purposes
outlined in this section. In the event an administrator is not appointed by
council for any reason, the city attorney or mayor shall serve as the planning
and zoning administrator on an ad hoc basis. The duties of the administrator
are as follows:
   A.   Interpret and administer this title by answering general questions and
assisting the public in the land use process;
   B.   Make administrative and discretionary determinations where required or
appropriate, provided that any affected person may appeal an administrative or
discretionary determination of the administrator to the council;
   C.   Arrange for scheduling and notice of public hearings and assist the
commission and council in fulfilling their responsibilities under this title;
   D.   Perform other reasonable and necessary functions to assure the
consistent, clear and faithful implementation of this title. (Ord. 527, 3-14-
2005)
5-3-2: AMENDMENT AND RECLASSIFICATION:
   A.   Initiation Of Proceedings:
      1.   This title may be amended whenever the council deems that amendment
is required for public convenience, necessity or general welfare. Any amendment
shall be enacted pursuant to this section, and for purposes of this section,
includes any measure to change district boundaries, establish or disestablish
districts, to change district regulations, to add, repeal or amend any other
provision of this title or the whole of this title.
      2.   An amendment to the text of this title or to the official zoning map
may be initiated by the council or the commission or by an application of one
or more of the owners of property affected by the proposed amendment.
      3.   Applications shall be filed with the commission on forms prescribed
by the commission, accompanied by such data and information necessary to assure
the fullest presentation of facts.
      4.   No application for the same general purpose concerning the same
property which has been denied by the city shall be received or processed
within one hundred eighty (180) days of such denial except by majority approval
of the council.
   B.   Commission Notice And Public Hearing:
      1.   The commission, prior to recommending an amendment, supplement, or
repeal of any portion of this title, shall conduct at least one public hearing
in which interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. The notice
and procedure for such hearing shall comply with Idaho Code section 67-6511.
      2.   If the request is in accordance with the adopted comprehensive plan,
the commission may recommend and the council may adopt or reject the amendment
to this title under the same notice and hearing procedures.
      3.   When notice is required to be given to two hundred (200) or more
property owners or purchasers of record, an alternative form of procedure of
official notice of the public hearing for both the commission and council shall
be that the public hearing notice shall be published in the official newspaper
or newspaper of general circulation in the area two (2) consecutive times.
      4.   If the request is not in accordance with the adopted comprehensive
plan, the request for amendment shall not take place until after the
comprehensive plan has been amended under notice and hearing procedures
provided in section 67-6509, Idaho Code, after which the request may be heard
again as provided for under the notice and hearing procedures as set forth
herein.
   C.   Development Agreements:
      1.   Legislative Purpose: The council finds that the ability to execute a
development agreement in connection with a change of zoning provides benefits
for both the property owner or developer and the city by providing a balance
between the owner or developer's desire for certainty in the development
process and the city's desire for control of any project impacts as a means to
ensure harmony with the established surrounding pattern of development; and,
therefore, the ability to execute such development agreements in appropriate
circumstances is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of Parma.
      2.   Creation And Form: At a minimum, development agreements shall
include the following:
         a.   A legal description of the subject property.
         b.   A description of the uses permitted on the land, which may
include preliminary site plan, elevation plans and other pertinent exhibits.
         c.   Provisions of any reservation or dedication of land.
         d.   The duration of the agreement.
         e.   The commitments or other terms of the agreement.
      3.   Commitments And Safeguards: The written commitments or conditions
exacted shall be specific and shall have a reasonable relation to the zoning
change approved. In addition, the following safeguards shall be applied:
         a.   A development agreement shall not prevent the city in subsequent
actions applicable to the property from applying new rules, regulations or
policies that do not conflict with commitments applicable to the property set
forth within any duly executed agreement.
         b.   If a commitment involves ongoing performances and the owner or
developer fails to comply with the commitment after completion of construction,
said failure may be dealt with by the city according to the violation and
penalty provisions of this chapter or the local land use planning act and/or
for specific performance of the development agreement, including attorney fees
and costs associated with the enforcement of the agreement.
         c.   When a commitment is required to be satisfied prior to completion
of construction and it is not so satisfied, construction shall be halted until
compliance is established.
      4.   Recordation: Development agreements shall be attached as an exhibit
to the ordinance establishing the zoning map amendment. Agreements shall take
effect and shall be recorded by the city in the office of the county recorder
upon the adoption of the ordinance establishing the zoning map amendment by the
council. Should a development agreement be terminated by the city, and the
zoning designation upon which the use is based be reversed, a document
recording such termination and zoning reversal shall also be recorded by the
city in the office of the county recorder. Unless otherwise modified or
terminated by the council, an agreement shall be binding on the owner of the
parcel, each subsequent owner and each other person acquiring an interest in
the parcel.
      5.   Termination, Modification And Extension: The establishment of a
development agreement and the written commitments contained therein, in
accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be deemed written consent
to change the zoning of the subject property to its prior designation upon
failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the agreement. A development
agreement may be modified only with the permission of the council after
complying with the notice and hearing provisions of this section. A development
agreement may be terminated by the city, and the zoning designation upon which
the use is based may be reversed upon the failure of the owner, developer or
each subsequent owner or person acquiring an interest in the subject parcel to
comply with the commitments in the agreement within two (2) years. The two (2)
year period of time for compliance of commitments may be extended by the city
for just cause and upon application for such by the owner, and after complying
with the notice and hearing provisions of this section. For commitments that
are ongoing in nature, the council may act to enforce the development agreement
at any time.
   D.   Action By The Commission:
      1.   The commission shall cause to be made by any of its members or by
any member of its staff such investigation of facts bearing upon such
amendment, supplement, repeal or matter of hearing as in the opinion of the
commission will serve to provide the necessary information to enable the
commission to act.
      2.   Not later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing,
the commission shall file with the council a written report stating the action
taken by the commission and its recommendation.
   E.   Council Notice And Public Hearing: The council, prior to adoption of an
amendment, supplement or repeal of this title, shall hold at least one public
hearing using the same notice and hearing procedures as the commission. If the
council makes a material change in the proposed amendment, supplement or
repeal, further notice and hearing shall be provided before the council adopts
the amendment, supplement or repeal. If the council approves the proposed
amendment, it shall thereafter be made a part of this title by appropriate
amendment to the official zoning map and zoning ordinance text.
   F.   Annexation: Prior to annexation of unincorporated area, the council
shall request and receive a recommendation from the commission on the proposed
zoning of said area upon annexation. Concurrently with or immediately following
the adoption of an ordinance of annexation, the council shall provide for
amendments to the official zoning map and map component of the comprehensive
plan. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-3-3: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCEDURES:
The following provisions shall apply to conditional use permits:
   A.   Every use which requires the granting of a conditional use permit is
declared to possess characteristics such as to require review and appraisal by
the commission to determine whether or not the use would cause any damage,
hazard, nuisance or other detriment to persons or property in the vicinity. The
commission may require higher standards of site development than listed
specifically in this title in order to correlate the proposed use to other
property and uses. The commission may revoke or modify its approval of a
conditional use permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
section under specific conditions and when it is not in conflict with the
comprehensive plan.
   B.   Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed with the city
clerk on forms prescribed by the commission accompanied by such data and
information necessary to assure the fullest presentation.
   C.   The commission shall conduct at least one public hearing on each
conditional use permit application in which interested persons shall have
opportunity to be heard. Notice procedures shall comply with 67-6512, Idaho
Code. When notice is required to two hundred (200) or more property owners or
purchasers of record, an alternative form of procedure of official notice shall
be that the public hearing notice shall be published in the official newspaper
or newspaper of general circulation two (2) consecutive times.
   D.   The commission shall cause to be made by any of its own members or by
any member of its staff, such investigation of facts bearing upon the
application as in the opinion of the commission will serve to provide the
necessary information to enable the commission to act.
   E.   Upon the granting of the conditional use permit, conditions may be
attached, including, but not limited to, those:
      1.   Minimizing adverse impact on other development;
      2.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development;
      3.   Controlling the duration of the use and/or development;
      4.   Assuring that development is maintained properly;
      5.   Designating the location and nature of development, including signs;
      6.   Requiring the provision for on site or off site public facilities or
services;
      7.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required
in an ordinance;
      8.   Specifying the period of time for which a permit is issued and
conditions which, if not followed, will bring about revocation of the
conditional use permit;
      9.   Requiring mitigation of effects of the proposed development upon
service delivery by any political subdivision, including school districts,
providing services within the planning jurisdiction.
   F.   Prior to granting a conditional use permit, studies may be required of
the social, economic, fiscal and environmental effects of the proposed use. A
conditional use permit shall not be considered as establishing a binding
precedent and shall not be transferable from one parcel of land to another.
   G.   Whenever the commission grants or desires a conditional use permit, it
shall specify in writing:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
      2.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
   H.   The applicant or any affected person having an interest in real
property within a three hundred foot (300') radius of the exterior boundaries
of the subject property may appeal the decision of the commission provided
written notice of such an appeal is filed with the city clerk within fifteen
(15) days after the written decision of the commission is signed.
   I.   In reviewing an appeal pertaining to the conditional use permit, the
council shall hold a de novo public hearing using the public hearing notice and
procedures prescribed for the commission. The council may approve, disapprove
or modify the action of the commission. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-3-4: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
The following provisions shall apply in considering variances:
   A.   The commission shall consider variances to the terms of this title
which will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title will result
in unnecessary hardship. A "variance" is a modification of the requirement of
this title as to lot size, lot coverage, width, depth, front yard, side yard,
rear yard, setback, parking space, height of buildings or other zoning
provisions affecting the size or shape of a structure or the placement of the
structure upon lots, or the size of lots. A variance shall not be considered a
right or special privilege, but may be granted to an applicant only upon a
showing of undue hardship.
Hardships shall not be self-imposed, but shall result from special site
characteristics relating to the size, location, configuration or dimensions of
the site or the placement of existing structures thereon, or from geographic,
topographic or other physical conditions which render the site unique from
other properties in the same zone or vicinity.
Prior to granting a variance, notice and an opportunity to be heard shall be
provided to property owners adjoining the parcel under consideration. In acting
upon a variance, the commission shall make a full investigation and shall only
grant a variance upon finding that the following are true:
      1.   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions, applicable to the property involved, which do not apply generally
to other properties within the same zoning district.
      2.   That the exceptional or extraordinary circumstances in conjunction
with a literal interpretation and application of the regulation would result in
undue hardship by depriving the applicant of reasonable use and enjoyment of
the property or of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties located
in the same zoning district.
      3.   That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of
special privilege.
      4.   That the granting of such relief will not be materially detrimental
to the public health, safety or welfare, or interest or injurious to the
property or improvements of other property owners, or the quiet enjoyment of
such property or improvement.
      5.   That the granting of the variance will not be in conflict with the
spirit and intent of the comprehensive plan and will not effect a change in
zoning.
   B.   An application for a variance may be initiated by or at the request of
a property owner. Such application shall be filed with the commission on forms
prescribed by the commission accompanied by such data and information necessary
to assure the fullest presentation of facts.
   C.   Prior to granting a variance, the commission shall conduct one public
hearing in accordance with the procedures prescribed for conditional use
permits, except that notice shall be provided only to property owners adjoining
the property for which the variance request is made.
   D.   Whenever the commission grants or denies a variance, it shall specify:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
      2.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
   E.   Upon the granting of the variance, terms and conditions may be attached
that:
      1.   Specify the nature and extent of relief being granted;
      2.   Minimize any adverse effect on neighboring properties or
improvements.
   F.   The applicant or any affected person having an interest in real
property within a three hundred foot (300') radius of the exterior boundaries
of the subject property may appeal the decision of the commission pursuant to
subsections
5-3-3H and I of this chapter. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)

written and in compliance with this section if the request is made on the
record at any regular or special meeting. Mediation may occur at any point
during the processing of the application, including after a final decision has

authority, shall participate in at least one mediation session. The party
requesting the mediation shall pay the expense of the mediator for the first
session. If the requesting party is not the city, the party requesting the
mediation shall pay the expenses reasonably incurred by the city in mediation.

agreed upon by the interested parties, the parties shall arrange with the
mediator for additional mediation sessions. The interested parties shall
determine among themselves, and with the mediator, at the commencement of any
subsequent mediation session, how the mediator shall be compensated. Mediation
sessions may continue as long as the interested parties and the mediator feel
that mediation is progressing toward resolution. If a mediation session ends
with no agreement for a subsequent session, the mediation shall be deemed
concluded.
   E.   Conclusion Of Mediation: Upon the conclusion of mediation, the mediator
shall notify the planning and zoning administrator. If the mediation was not
successful, no details or other information shall be given by the mediator. If
the mediation is successful, the mediator shall transcribe the terms of the
agreed upon resolution, securing the signature of the applicant and at least
one representative of those in opposition at the final mediation session. The
mediator shall deliver the agreement to the planning and zoning administrator.
   F.   Successful Mediation: If the mediation is successfully concluded upon
terms that do not involve the withdrawal of the application, the application
shall be scheduled for the next available hearing date of the decision making
authority for action consistent with this chapter. The final decision making
authority may conclude the matter upon the terms of the signed agreement.
   G.   Time Limitations Tolled: During mediation, any time limitation relevant
to the application shall be tolled. Such tolling shall cease when the applicant
or any other affected person, after having participated in at least one
mediation session, states in writing that no further participation is desired
and notifies the other parties, or upon notice of a request to mediate wherein
no mediation session is scheduled for twenty eight (28) days from the date of
such request.

for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of
the provisions of this title is committed, continued or permitted. Violations
of this title shall be and are hereby declared a nuisance.

department of the city, or their authorized designee, to enforce all provisions
of this title and refer violations to the city attorney who shall initiate
actions in the courts when necessary, and his failure to do so shall not
legalize any violation of such provisions.
   C.   The planning and zoning administrator, or the police department of the
city, or their duly authorized designee, shall have the right to enter upon any
land during the daytime in the course of his duties and, if approached by the
property owner or lessor, shall show proper identification and give that
individual notice as to the purpose of the visit. They may enter in any
building upon being invited by an owner or tenant and may enter a structure
closed to them by permission of an owner or occupant or through absence of the
same upon obtaining an administrative search warrant.
   D.   In any case where any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, converted or maintained or any building, structure or
land is used in violation of this title, the city, through any authorized
representative, may in its discretion pursue appropriate action or proceedings
to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
conversion, maintenance or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation;
to prevent the occupancy or use of said building, structure, or land; or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such building,

5-6-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult
businesses, commonly called sexually oriented businesses, in order to promote
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city of
Parma, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within
the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   B.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available
to the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes
v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S.
Ct. 1382 (2000); State of Idaho v. Morris, Rocky Mountain Videos, Adult Shoppe,
Northwest Films, Inc., RAN Enterprises, Inc., Canyon County third judicial
district court case #CV 2000-02792 (2000); and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to, Cleburne, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Garden
Grove, California; Adams County, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Phoenix,
Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Las Vegas, Nevada; and
Cleveland, Ohio, the council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for some of the activities that occur on
their premises.
      2.   Employees of some sexually oriented businesses may be unable to
observe the activities of their customers at all times, thereby increasing the
likelihood of ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities on their premises.
      3.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses may engage in
higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of
other establishments.
      4.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      5.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      6.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      7.   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-
AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
      8.   Since 1982, there has been an increasing cumulative number of
reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the
United States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985;
733,374 in 1999; and 859,000 in 2002.
      9.   From April, 1986, when HIV became a reportable disease by Idaho Code
section 39-602, through December 31, 2000, there were 736 cases of HIV/AIDS in
the state of Idaho.
      10.   From January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001, reported cases of
HIV/AIDS in the state of Idaho decreased to 702, but that has been the last
decrease seen in the statistics.
      11.   From January 1, 2002 through the second quarter of 2004, there has
been an increasing cumulative number of cases of HIV/AIDS in the state of
Idaho.
      12.   At the end of the second quarter of 2004, there were 761 reported
cases of HIV/AIDS in the state of Idaho.
      13.   The number of cases of syphilis reported in Idaho in 2003 was 45,
with 21 of those cases being in region 3 (Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette
and Washington counties); for the first half of 2004, 28 new cases of syphilis
have been reported in region 3 (Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and
Washington counties).
      14.   The number of cases of genital chlamydia in Idaho reported annually
has risen steadily, since 1999, with 2,609 statewide cases reported in 2003,
making chlamydia the most reported of all notifiable infectious diseases in the
United States. Of the 2,609 cases reported in 2003, 475 were in region 3
(Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties); for the first
half of 2004, 243 new cases of genital chlamydia have been reported in region 3
(Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties).
      15.   The number of cases of gonorrhea reported in Idaho in 2003 was 76,
with 14 of those cases being in region 3 (Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette
and Washington counties); for the first half of 2004, 9 new cases of gonorrhea
have been reported in region 3 (Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and
Washington counties).
      16.   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      17.   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
      18.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      19.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
      20.   The findings noted in this section raise substantial governmental
concerns.
      21.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      22.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      23.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually
oriented businesses.
      24.   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      25.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      26.   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      27.   The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption
that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      28.   The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and
prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases.
      29.   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 527, 3-14-
2005)

the revocation of the license.
   D.   When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in section
5-6-11 of this chapter, the enforcement officer revokes a license, the
revocation shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a
sexually oriented business license for one year from the date revocation
becomes effective, provided that, if the conditions of subsection
 5-6-11B of this chapter are met, a provisional license will be granted
pursuant to that section. If, subsequent to revocation, the enforcement officer
finds that the basis for the revocation found in subsections B1 and B4 of this
section has been corrected or abated, the applicant shall be granted a license
if at least ninety (90) days have elapsed since the date the revocation became
effective. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)

   A.   If the enforcement officer determines that facts exist for denial,
suspension, or revocation of a license under this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall notify the applicant or licensee (respondent) in writing of the
intent to deny, suspend or revoke the license, including the grounds therefor,
by personal delivery, or by certified mail. The notification shall be directed
to the most current business address on file with the enforcement officer.
Within five (5) working days of receipt of such notice, the respondent may
provide to the mayor and council in writing a response that shall include a
statement of reasons why the license or permit should not be denied, suspended,
or revoked. Within three (3) days of the receipt of respondent's written
response, the mayor shall notify respondent in writing of the hearing date on
respondent's denial, suspension, or revocation proceeding.
Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of respondent's written response,
the mayor and council shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall have
the opportunity to be represented by counsel and present evidence and witnesses
on his or her behalf. If a response is not received by the mayor and council in
the time stated or, if after the hearing the council finds that grounds as
specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension, or revocation, then
such denial, suspension, or revocation shall become final five (5) days after
the mayor sends, by certified mail, written notice that the license has been
denied, suspended, or revoked. Such notice shall include a statement advising
the applicant or licensee of the right to appeal such decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
If the council finds that no grounds exist for denial, suspension, or
revocation of a license, then within five (5) days after the hearing, the mayor
shall withdraw the intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license and shall so
notify the respondent in writing by certified mail of such action and shall
contemporaneously therewith issue the license.
   B.   When a decision to deny, suspend or revoke a license becomes final, the
applicant or licensee (aggrieved party) whose application for a license has
been denied or whose license has been suspended or revoked shall have the right
to appeal such action by filing a petition for judicial review with the
district court for Canyon County, Idaho, following the procedures set out in
rule 84 of the Idaho rules of civil procedure. Upon the filing of any court
action to appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's
enforcement of the denial, suspension, or revocation, the city shall
immediately issue the aggrieved party a provisional license. The provisional
license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the sexually
oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business
employee and will expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the aggrieved
party's action to appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's

5-7-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   To accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses
while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
community, the council finds that regulations regarding wireless communication
facilities, spires, poles, antennas, steeples, towers, and other such
structures are necessary in order to:
      1.   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to
the residents and businesses of the city;
      2.   Minimize adverse visual effects of spires, poles, antennas,
steeples, towers, and other such structures through careful design and siting
standards;
      3.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from spire, pole,
antenna, steeple, tower, and other such structures' failure, through structural
standards and setback requirements; and
      4.   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
   TOWER: Any facility designed and constructed solely for the purpose of
supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio, and similar communication
purposes. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave
towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like.
The term includes the structure and its associated means of support.
   WCF OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY: Refers to a tower and all
attachments. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-3: TOWERS IN ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Residential (R) districts:
      1.   On residentially zoned parcels, towers supporting amateur radio
antennas shall not be permitted in the front, side or street side yard.
      2.   Personal wireless facilities shall be prohibited in all residential
(R) zones.
   B.   Commercial (C) and industrial (M) districts:
      1.   Wireless antennas may be permitted to be attached to existing light
standards and power line support devices (or replacement equivalent of same
height) provided, however, the antenna(s) is either flush mounted or mounted in
a manner that provides minimum visual impact. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to wireless antennas located
on existing light standards and power line support devices. (Ord. 527, 3-14-
2005)
5-7-4: COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   A proposal for a new tower in excess of applicable zone district height
requirements shall not be approved unless the council finds that the
communications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated
on an existing or approved tower or building within the following radii of the
proposed tower:
      1.   A two (2) mile radius for towers with a height over one hundred ten
feet (110').
      2.   A one mile radius for towers with a height over eighty feet (80')
but not more than one hundred ten feet (110').
      3.   A one-half (1/2) mile radius for towers with a height over fifty
feet (50') but not more than eighty feet (80').
      4.   A one-fourth (1/4) mile radius for towers with a height over thirty
five feet (35') but not more than fifty feet (50').
   B.   It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that the
proposed tower or antenna cannot be accommodated on an approved tower or
building within the required search radius due to one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Unwillingness of another tower or facility owner to entertain shared
use.
      2.   The proposed collocation of an existing tower or facility would be
in violation of any local, state or federal law.
      3.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
      4.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building
as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
      5.   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius
cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
      6.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, or
other professional qualified to provide necessary documentation.
   C.   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall
be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate
both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2)
additional users if the tower is over one hundred ten feet (110') in height,
for at least one additional user if the tower is over fifty feet (50') in
height.
   D.   Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas
upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
   E.   Wireless communication facilities proposed at a location which has an
approved conditional use permit (approved after the effective date hereof) for
an existing facility which was required to allow collocation shall not be
required to obtain a separate conditional use permit as long as all the
requirements of the previously approved conditional use permit will be complied
with. Design review, and subsequent building permit, will be required for any
such proposal. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-5: TOWER AND ANTENNA DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All wireless communication facilities shall be required to obtain
design review approval prior to construction.
   B.   Towers and antennas shall be required to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities
such as the federal aviation administration.
   C.   Wireless communication facility towers shall be of a monopole design
unless the council determines that an alternative design would better blend
into the surrounding environment.
   D.   With the exception of necessary electric and telephone service and
connection lines approved by the issuing authority, no part of any antenna or
tower nor any lines, cable, equipment or wires or braces in connection with
either shall at any time extend across or over any part of the right of way,
public street, highway, sidewalk, or property line.
   E.   Every tower affixed to the ground shall be protected to discourage
climbing of the tower by unauthorized persons. The climbing pegs within the
bottom twenty feet (20') of the tower shall be removed and shall only be used
when the tower is being serviced.
   F.   Metal towers shall be constructed of, or treated with, corrosive
resistant material.
   G.   Wood poles shall be impregnated with rot resistant substances. (Ord.
527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-6: TOWER SETBACKS:
   A.   Towers shall meet the setbacks of the underlying zoning district with
the exception of industrial zoning districts, where towers may encroach into
the rear setback area, provided that the rear property line abuts another
industrially zoned property and the tower does not encroach upon any easements.
   B.   If the tower does not exceed the height limitations of the zone in
which it is located, the tower shall meet the setback requirement of the zone
except as allowed in subsection A of this section. If the tower exceeds the
height limit of the zone in which it is located, the tower shall be set back
one foot (1') for every ten feet (10') in total tower height. In either case,
the tower shall be constructed to the Telecommunications Industry Association/
Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA) 222 revision F standard entitled
"Structural Standards For Steel Antenna Supporting Structures" as now in
existence or as hereinafter amended. Otherwise, the tower shall be located a
minimum of one foot (1') for each foot of height from all property lines (the
fall zone). No storage or structures other than the accessory utility
buildings, are permitted in the fall zone, except as may be specifically
permitted by the council through a conditional use process.
   C.   Towers shall be set back from all existing public right of way lines
(or planned right of way lines if additional right of way is planned to be
acquired in the future) by a minimum distance equal to twice the height of the
tower including all antennas and attachments. If this requirement conflicts
with other setback requirements of this code the setback with the greater
distance shall prevail, except as may be allowed in subsection E of this
section.
   D.   Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a public
street.
   E.   A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a
public street varied, at the sole discretion of the council, to allow the
integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church
steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure. (Ord.
527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-7: TOWER LIGHTING, SIGNAGE, AND ATTACHMENTS:
   A.   No antenna or tower shall have affixed or attached to it in any way,
except during time of repair or installation, any stationary lights, strobe
lights, reflectors, flashers, or other illuminating device, except as
specifically required by the federal aviation administration, federal
communications commission, or other federal or state authority.
   B.   When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures
used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached
to the tower if approved by the city.
   C.   The use of any portion of a tower for signs, other than warning or
equipment information signs, is prohibited.
   D.   No tower shall have constructed thereon, or attached thereto, in any
way, any platform, catwalk, crow's nest, or like structure, except during
periods of construction or repair. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-8: AMATEUR RADIO ANTENNAS:
In accordance with the federal communications commission's preemptive ruling
PRB 1, towers erected for the primary purpose of supporting amateur radio
antennas may exceed thirty feet (30') in height provided that a determination
is made by the city that the proposed tower height is technically necessary to
successfully engage in amateur radio communications. A conditional use permit
is required for any amateur radio antenna in excess of thirty five feet (35').
(Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-7-9: ABANDONED OR UNUSED TOWERS OR PORTIONS OF TOWERS:

CHAPTER 8
TREES AND SHRUBS
SECTION:
5-8-1: Definitions
5-8-2: Landscape Provisions
5-8-1: DEFINITIONS:
   ARBORICULTURAL: The cultivation of trees; the art of planting, dressing and
managing trees and shrubs.
   CLASS 1, 2, AND 3 TREES: Classes of trees listed in this chapter. Class 1
trees are usually small and ornamental. Class 2 trees are appropriate for
planting near streets, sidewalks and paved areas and are medium to large in
their size and shape. Class 3 trees are large and require considerable amounts
of open space.
   CONTROLLER: Every person (owner, agent, tenant, occupant, contractor,
developer or lessee) who exercises care, custody and control of real property,
to include that abutting a right of way upon which a public tree or shrub is
located.
   GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN PROFESSIONAL ARBORICULTURAL PRACTICE: As used in this
chapter, this phrase shall mean and refer to a standard of care to be employed
when planting, installing, selecting, caring for, maintaining, pruning,
removing, or otherwise treating a tree or shrub. Such standard of care shall be
consistent with techniques routinely employed by professionals trained and
knowledgable in arboriculture.
   INJURIOUS PEST OR DISEASE: Organisms capable of seriously damaging the form
or structural integrity of the tree.
   NUISANCE: Shall have the meaning described in subsection
5-8-2D of this chapter.
   PARKWAY: That portion of public right of way situated between the curb line
of any street and the property line abutting and adjoining any street. In the
absence of a curb, the curb line of a street shall be deemed to be the edge of
that portion of public right of way maintained and open to the use of the
public for purposes of vehicular travel. The purpose of the parkway is to
increase pedestrian safety and to improve the visual aesthetics and
environmental quality of roadways.
   PERSON: Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association, company or
organization of any kind.
   PESTICIDE: An agent used to destroy pests.
   PRUNING: The removal of plant parts, dead or alive, in a careful and
systematic manner so as not to damage other parts of the plant or the tree as a
whole.
   PUBLIC TREE AND/OR SHRUB: Any tree or shrub located, in whole or in part,
upon or over any street or other public property.
   SHRUB: A multiple stemmed, woody plant whose height at maturity is between
three feet (3') and fifteen feet (15').
   STREET: Highways, roads, alleys and bridges, dedicated, purchased or
otherwise acquired for the public, including the unimproved or unused portion
thereof, maintained and open to use by the public, including sidewalks,
parkways and special tree planting easements adjacent to a street granted by
property owners.
   TOPPING: Cutting back the limbs of a tree within the tree's crown to such a
degree as to remove the natural canopy and disfigure the tree. Topping starves
the tree of needed nutrients and increases its vulnerability to disease and
insect infestation.
   TREE: A woody perennial plant usually having one main stem or trunk and many
branches; it usually exceeds fifteen feet (15') in height at maturity.
   VISION OR SIGHT TRIANGLE: A protected vision area established to ensure that
drivers have an unobstructed view as they come upon a driveway access, alleyway
or intersection. Measuring from the projected intersection of the roadway edge
a distance of forty feet (40') along each roadway edge and connecting the two
(2) points with a straight line, this defines the boundaries of a vision
triangle at the intersection of two (2) roads. (Ord. 527, 3-14-2005)
5-8-2: LANDSCAPE PROVISIONS:

adjacent to the controller's private real property, including the following
activities or actions:
      1.   Removal and replacement of public trees and shrubs, or portions
thereof, that are declared to be a public nuisance. Whenever a public tree or
shrub is removed, the controller shall replace it with a like variety, from the
appropriate category, selected from the tables set forth in this chapter unless
this replacement requirement is waived by the council for good cause shown.
      2.   Removal of private trees and shrubs located on the controller's
private real property that are declared a public nuisance.

responsibility to remove.
   D.   Public Nuisances: The following are hereby declared public nuisances:
      1.   Any tree, shrub or other plant, which by reason of location or
condition: a) constitutes an imminent danger to the health, safety or welfare
of the general public, b) harbors pathogens or injurious insects which
reasonably may be expected to injure or harm other trees or shrubs, c)
obstructs the free passage of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, d) obstructs a
streetlight or traffic control device, and/or e) obstructs the view in the

notice shall describe the nuisance and the steps necessary for its abatement.
If any person fails or neglects to abate the nuisance within five (5) days from
the delivery of the abatement notice, the city may proceed to abate the
nuisance without further notice. Abatement costs will be assessed to the
property and shall become a special assessment against the property upon which
the nuisance existed or, if the nuisance was in the public right of way, the
adjoining property with maintenance responsibilities outlined in this chapter.
   F.   Damaging, Endangering, Destroying Or Topping Of Public Trees Or Shrubs:
It is unlawful for any person to:
      1.   Damage, mutilate or destroy any public tree or shrub.
      2.   Store or place, or cause to be stored or placed, oil, gasoline,
chemicals (such as herbicides), or any other material harmful to vegetation,
near a public tree or shrub.
      3.   Attach a potentially harmful device or structure (such as a tree
house or sign) to a public tree or shrub.
      4.   Spill or dump substances, whether liquid or solid, which are toxic
to persons, animals, trees, shrubs and vegetative matter.

SECTION:
5-9-1: Intent And Purpose
5-9-2: Applicability And Gateway Streets
5-9-3: Street And Street Side Improvements
5-9-4: Maintenance Of Contiguous Property
5-9-5: Off Street Parking Areas
5-9-6: Fencing Along Gateway Streets
5-9-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
The city of Parma recognizes that beautification can be a significant expense
to business people, property owners and residents. At the same time,
beautification improves the livability of a community, enhances the appearance
and customer attraction of commercial areas, increases property values, screens
undesirable views, and can reduce air and noise pollution through landscape
requirements. The intent of these regulations is to achieve a balance between
the right of individuals to develop and maintain their property in a manner
they prefer and the right of city residents to live, work, shop, and recreate
in pleasant, healthy, and attractive surroundings. Among the benefits derived
from beautification are the following:
   A.   Aesthetic benefits:
      1.   Reduced glare and reflected light;
      2.   Shade for buildings, streets and parking lots;
      3.   Defines outdoor spaces;
      4.   Seasonal color, including flowers and fall color;
      5.   Frames and reveals desired views;
      6.   Adds natural elements to otherwise harsh urban development;
      7.   Attracts birds and other urban wildlife;
      8.   Helps maintain the rural feel of the city; and
      9.   Visually ties the city to the surrounding countryside.
   B.   Economic benefits:
      1.   More profitable business districts;
      2.   Consumers report greater willingness to pay for products in
aesthetically attractive, landscaped commercial areas;
      3.   Attracts new businesses;
      4.   Encourages redevelopment and economic investment in the local
community;
      5.   Office and retail space leases more quickly;
      6.   Reduces energy consumption for air conditioning, etc.; and
      7.   Increases residential property values.
   C.   Environmental benefits:
      1.   Prevents soil erosion;
      2.   Removes particulate pollutants from the air;
      3.   Provides extra oxygen in the atmosphere;
      4.   Removes carbon dioxide from the air;
      5.   Improves soil condition;
      6.   Purifies water supplies, especially storm runoff;
      7.   Reduces unwanted noise; and
      8.   Controls and directs excessive wind. (Ord. 551, 2-9-2009)
5-9-2: APPLICABILITY AND GATEWAY STREETS:
This chapter applies to Parma's gateway streets, Grove Avenue and Roswell
Boulevard. Grove is considered a gateway street at all places within the
corporate city limits as now existing or as may be hereafter adjusted. Roswell
is considered a gateway street from the point where it enters city limits as
now existing or as may be hereafter adjusted, northerly to the intersection
with Grove, though, as set forth more fully in section
5-9-3 of this chapter, that portion of Roswell lying south of the train tracks
shall be treated distinctly from the portion lying north of the train tracks.
This chapter also applies to any real property contiguous to a gateway street
which shall be hereinafter referred to as a "contiguous property". Gateway
streets are some of the most heavily traveled thoroughfares in the city and
transport most of the commerce in and out of the city. They also provide
visitors with their primary physical impression of Parma and access to the
majority of Parma's businesses. It is essential to the public health, safety
and welfare that any use or new construction along gateway streets complies
with the provisions of this title generally and this chapter in particular.
(Ord. 551, 2-9-2009)
5-9-3: STREET AND STREET SIDE IMPROVEMENTS:
Any application for: a) rezoning, b) subdividing, c) special use permit or d)
any building permit for new construction or alteration affecting fifty percent
(50%) or more of the value of improvements where such application involves a
gateway street or contiguous property shall comply with the following
requirements:
   A.   Street Cuts: No utility cuts into the pavement of gateway streets will
be permitted without a permit from the government entity having jurisdiction.
   B.   Curb, Gutter And Sidewalks:
      1.   Property contiguous to Roswell Boulevard north of the railroad
tracks: Six inch (6") vertical curb and gutter, and eight foot (8') sidewalks,
meeting city standards shall be constructed adjacent to Roswell Boulevard. See
figure 1 of this section.

IMAGES/0-0-0-27.png]
 
      2.   Property contiguous to Roswell Boulevard south of the railroad
tracks: A swale system and a five foot (5') cement meandering sidewalk meeting
city standards shall be constructed adjacent to Roswell Boulevard. See figure 2
of this section. Once constructed, the swale system shall be maintained in a
working and weed free condition by the property owner or the city may mail the
property owner notice of the owner's failure to maintain the system and, after
fourteen (14) calendar days from date of the city's notice, perform necessary
maintenance to the swale system and assess the property for the city's
maintenance costs and expenses.

   C.   Plans: Plans for curb, gutter, sidewalk and pavement match design must
be submitted to and approved by the government entity having jurisdiction.
   D.   Streetlights And Trees: Applicants shall be required to install
streetlights and trees approved by the city. City approval shall include
installation, location and spacing of streetlights and trees determined by the
city. Trees must be installed in tree wells. Power to the streetlights and
irrigation water for the trees must be provided by the applicant. Tree types
must be from an approved list provided by the city. However, for any
application triggering this section involving property on or contiguous to any
portion of Roswell lying south of the train tracks, no streetlights or trees
shall be required.
   E.   Guarantee Of Improvements:
      1.   In lieu of the actual installation of curbs, gutters and sidewalks,
the council may permit the applicant to provide a financial guarantee in a form
acceptable to the city engineer in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the total estimated cost for completing construction of the specified
improvements as estimated by the city engineer, to be held in trust by the
department or city to guarantee completion of said improvements.
      2.   In lieu of the actual installation of streetlights, street trees,
tree wells and irrigation, the council may permit the applicant to provide a
financial guarantee or surety in the form of a letter of credit, certificate of
deposit, or cash which shall be in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the total estimated cost for completing construction of the specified
improvements as estimated by the city engineer, to be held in trust by the city
to guarantee completion of said improvements.
   F.   Inspections: The applicant shall be required to pay the department and/
or city inspection fees for the inspection of improvements.
   G.   Completion Required Prior To Issuance Of Certificate Of Occupancy Or
Approval Of Final Plat: No certificate of occupancy shall be issued to the
applicant, nor final plat approved, until the improvements required have been
installed, or an acceptable guarantee of improvements, as set forth in
subsection E of this section, has been received by the city. (Ord. 551, 2-9-
2009)
5-9-4: MAINTENANCE OF CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY:
For all parcels of property contiguous to "gateway streets", as described in
section
5-9-2 of this chapter, the yards and setback areas adjoining any public street,
including, without limitation, gateway streets and their cross streets, must be
landscaped and maintained. For purposes of this section, the term "landscape"
shall mean, at a minimum, the intentional growing of a grass lawn, or other
similar ground covering vegetation, over the entire yard and setback area.
Provided, however, that areas improved and used and maintained as off street
parking driveways, walkways, gardens or flowerbeds shall be exempt. For
purposes of this section, the term "maintained" shall mean the exercise of all
reasonable and customary activities to preserve vegetative matter in a healthy,
clean, trimmed or pruned, weed free condition as well as the exercise of
diligence in preventing the accumulation of debris, trash, garbage, inoperable
equipment, waste, trimmings or clippings, appliances, indoor furniture or use
of the yard and setback areas for storage of anything not intended for regular
use in the yard or setback area itself. (Ord. 551, 2-9-2009)
5-9-5: OFF STREET PARKING AREAS:
Portions of any parcel of property contiguous to "gateway streets", as
described in section
5-9-2 of this chapter, that are used for off street parking shall, in addition
to any other requirement applicable to such use, landscape and maintain ten
percent (10%) of the off street parking area. As nearly as practicable, said
ten percent (10%) area shall be adjacent to the gateway street(s). (Ord. 551,
2-9-2009)

   A.   Short title: This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City
of Parma Development Impact Fee Ordinance.
   B.   Findings: The Parma, Idaho City Council finds that:
      1.   The City of Parma is experiencing considerable growth and
development.
      2.   The new growth and development occurring within the City of Parma
will place ever-increasing demands on the City to provide, improve and expand
existing public facilities to serve that new growth and development and the tax
revenues generated from that new growth and development often does not generate
sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements and expansion of the
public facilities to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   Those users that create the increased demand should bear their proportionate
share of the cost of public facilities needed to serve the new growth and
development.
   C.   Authority: Title 67, Chapter 82, Idaho Code.
   D.   Applicability: This ordinance applies to all new development and
construction within the City limits of the City of Parma, Idaho.
   E.   Purpose: The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new residential
and non-residential development bears a proportionate share of the cost of
System Improvements; to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed
the cost of such System Improvements required to accommodate new Development;
and to ensure that funds collected from new Development are actually used for
System Improvements in accordance with the Act. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)

   A.   Payment of Fees. The Impact Fee shall be paid to the City at the
following times:
      1.   If a Building Permit or manufactured/mobile home installation permit
is required, then before or at the time the permit is issued;

permit is required, then at the time that construction commences; or
      3.   At such other time as the Fee Payer or Developer and the City have
agreed upon in writing.
   B.   Enforcement. When any Impact Fee is due pursuant to this chapter, or
pursuant to the terms of any written agreement between a Fee Payer and the
City, and such Impact Fee has not been paid in a timely manner, the City may
exercise any or all of the following powers as applicable to its authority, in
any combination, to enforce the collection of the Impact Fee:
      1.   Withhold Building Permits, manufactured home installation permits,
or other City Development Approval related to the Development for which the
Impact Fee is due until all Impact Fees due have been paid, and issue stop work
orders, and revoke or suspend a Building Permit;
      2.   Withhold utility services from the Development for which the Impact
Fee is due until all Impact Fees due have been paid;
      3.   Add interest to the Impact Fee not paid in full at the legal rate
provided for in Idaho Code § 28-22-104, as it may be amended, plus five percent
(5%) beginning on the date at which the payment of the Impact Fee was due until
paid in full;

for failure to timely pay an Impact Fee following the procedures contained in
Idaho Code Title 45, Chapter 5. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-5: CERTIFICATION:
   A.   A Fee Payer may request a written certification of the impact fee
schedule or individual assessment which shall establish the impact fee for that
Development. Such certification shall establish the Impact Fee so long as there
is no material change to the particular Development as identified in the
individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule. A certification
may be applied for in the following manner:
      1.   Requests for certification shall be in writing and made to the City.
Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the City shall issue a
written certification of the amount of the Impact Fee due for the proposed
Development. The certification shall include an explanation of the calculation
of the Impact Fee including an explanation of factors considered under Idaho
Code § 67-8207 and shall also specify the System Improvement(s) for which the
Impact Fee is intended to be used. The City shall provide the certification to
the Fee Payer. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-6: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT:
   A.   In lieu of calculating the amount of the Impact Fee using the impact
fee schedules in this Title, an individual assessment of Impact Fees is
permitted when the Fee Payer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
the established Impact Fee is inappropriate.
      1.   Individual Assessment Process. A Fee Payer may file a written
request for an individual assessment of the Development by the City with the
City prior to the receipt of a building permit or other necessary approvals or
entitlements from the City. A request for an individual assessment process
shall involve consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant
information submitted by the Fee Payer to adjust the amount of the Impact Fee.
If a Fee Payer files a request for the use of an individual assessment, the Fee
Payer shall be responsible for retaining a qualified professional to prepare
the individual assessment that complies with the requirements of this chapter,
at the Fee Payer's expense. The Fee Payer shall bear the burden of proving by
clear and convincing evidence that the resulting individual assessment is a
more accurate measure of its proportionate share of the cost of System
Improvements, based on the City's adopted Level of Service, than the
development impact fees that would otherwise be due pursuant to the fee
schedule.
         a.   Each individual assessment request and supporting documentation
submitted by the Fee Payer shall be based on the same level of service
standards and unit costs for System Improvements used in the City's Capital
Improvements Plan, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost) methodology,
and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions used.
         b.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the City may then
be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by the City as the basis
for calculating the Impact Fee. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or
acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is a
more accurate measure of demand for System Improvements element(s) created by
the proposed Development, or the costs of those facilities, than the applicable
fee shown in the fee schedule.
         c.   The City shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days
following receipt of a completed request for individual assessment together
with all supporting information from the Fee Payer, so as not to unreasonably
delay the Developer's (Fee Payer's) subsequent applications to the City for
Building Permits.
         d.   The decision by the City on an application for an individual
assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the Impact Fee,
shall specify the System Improvement(s) for which the Impact Fee is intended to
be used, and shall include an explanation of those factors identified in Idaho
Code § 67-8207.
         e.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the City then the Impact Fee due under this chapter for such
Development shall be calculated according to such individual assessment. (Ord.
617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-7: DEVELOPER CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENT:
   A.   When a Developer or their predecessor in title or interest has
constructed System Improvements of the same category as a Capital Improvements
Element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards the completion of
System Improvements of the same category as the Capital Improvements Element,
and the City has accepted such construction, contribution or dedication, the
City shall issue a credit against the Impact Fees otherwise due for the same
Capital Improvements Element in connection with the proposed Development, as
set forth in this section, credit shall be issued regardless of whether the
contribution or dedication to System Improvements was required by the City as a
condition of Development Approval or was offered by the Developer and accepted
by the City in writing, and regardless of whether the contribution or
dedication was contributed by the Developer or by a local improvement District
controlled by the Developer.
   B.   Credits against an Impact Fee shall not be given for:
      1.   Project Improvements; or
      2.   Any construction, contribution or dedication not agreed to in
writing by the City prior to commencement of the construction, contribution, or
dedication. Credits issued for one Capital Improvements Element may not be used
to reduce Impact Fees due for a different capital improvement. No credits shall
be issued for System Improvements contributed or dedicated prior to the
effective date of this chapter.
   C.   Valuation of Credit at Present Value:
      1.   Land. Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the Fee
Payer's option, be valued at the present value of:
         a.   One hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the City assessor; or
         b.   That fair market value established by a private appraiser
acceptable to the City in an appraisal paid for by the Fee Payer.
      2.   Improvements. Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall be valued by the City at the present value of such
improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the Fee Payer to the City. The City
shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information submitted,
or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on
alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to the City as a more
accurate measure of the value of the offered System Improvements to the City
   D.   When Credits Become Effective:
      1.   Land. Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective
when the land has been conveyed to the City in a form acceptable to the City,
at no cost to the City, and has been accepted by the City. Upon request of the
Fee Payer, the City shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit
available.
      2.   Improvements. Approved credits for acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall generally become effective when (a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the City, (b) a
suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the
City, and (c) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the City and the state of Idaho. Upon request of the Fee Payer,
the City shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
   E.   Credit Request Process:
      1.   Request. In order to obtain a credit against an Impact Fee otherwise
due, a Fee Payer shall submit to the City a written offer of request to
dedicate to the City specific parcels of qualifying land or a written offer to
contribute or construct specific System Improvements to the Capital Facilities
in accordance with all applicable State or City design and construction
standards, and shall specifically request a credit against the type of Impact
Fee for which the land dedication or System Improvements is offered.
      2.   Review. After receipt of the written offer of request for credit,
the City shall review the request and determine whether the land or System
Improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing Capital
Facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If the City
determines that the offered credit satisfies that criteria and will be
acceptable to the City Board of Commissioners, then the credit shall be issued.
The City shall complete its review and determination of an application within
thirty (30) days after receipt of an application for credit.
      3.   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due. If the credit due to a Fee Payer
pursuant to this Title exceeds the Impact Fee that would otherwise be due from
the Fee Payer pursuant to the chapter (whether calculated through the Impact
Fee schedule in section
5A-1-3 or through an individual assessment), the Fee Payer may choose to
receive such credit in the form of either: (a) a credit against future Impact
Fee due for the same System Improvements; or (b) a reimbursement from Impact
Fees paid by future Development that impacts the System Improvements
contributed or dedicated by the Fee Payer. Unless otherwise stated in an
agreement with the Fee Payer, the City shall be under no obligation to use any
of the City funds - other than Impact Fees paid by other Development for the
same System Improvements - to reimburse the Fee Payer for any credit in excess
Impact Fees that are due.
      4.   Written Agreement Required. If credit or reimbursement is due to the
Fee Payer pursuant to this section, the City shall enter into a written
agreement with the Fee Payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the System Improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount,
time and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years.
      5.   The City's determination on the written offer of request for credit
shall be provided to the Fee Payer. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-8: METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   General Provisions.
      1.   Accounting Principles. The calculation of the Impact Fee shall be in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A development impact
fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in an
incidental benefit to owners or Developers within the service area other than
the Fee Payer.
      2.   Levels Of Service. The Impact Fee shall be calculated on the basis
of levels of service for Public Facilities in the adopted Capital Improvement
Plan that are applicable to existing Development as well as new growth and
Development. The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or
existing Public Facilities for which the Impact Fee is imposed must be
attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new Development.
   B.   Methodology; Proportionate Methodology. The Impact Fee shall not exceed
a proportionate share of the cost of the System Improvements determined in
accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8207, as it may be amended. Impact Fees shall
be based on actual System Improvements Costs or reasonable estimates of such
costs. The amount of the Impact Fee shall be calculated using the methodology
contained in the adopted Capital Improvements Plan.
   C.   Proportionate Share Determination.
      1.   The Impact Fee shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula or
method under which the Impact Fee imposed does not exceed a proportionate share
of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the City in the provision of System
Improvements to serve the new Development. The proportionate share is the costs
attributable to the new Development after the City considers the following:
         a.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money,
dedication of land or construction of System Improvements;
         b.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
         c.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the
City to System Improvements; and
         d.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.
      2.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of System
Improvements to be paid by the Developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the City and accounted for in the calculation of the Impact Fee:
         a.   The costs of existing System Improvements within the Service
area;
         b.   The means by which existing System Improvements have been
financed;
         c.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements Costs through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements Costs
through Developer or landowner contributions;
         d.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing System Improvements in the future;
         e.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area;
         f.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development;
         g.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         h.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-9: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT:
   A.   The City may make an initial determination that Development may impose
an Extraordinary Impact due to a review of a development application
transmitted to the City pursuant to the City's zoning authority under the Local
Land Use Planning Act, chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code.
   B.   Process:
      1.   Within thirty (30) days after City's receipt of the development
application, the City will notify the Fee Payer of the City's initial
determination that the Development may impose an Extraordinary Impact. Such
notice shall include that a supplemental study, at the Fee Payer's expense will
be required.
      2.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a Development
with Extraordinary Impact, the City shall meet with the Fee Payer to discuss
whether the Fee Payer wants to: (a) pay for the supplemental study necessary to
determine the System Improvements Costs related to the proposed Development;
(b) modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary Impact; or (c)
withdraw the application for certification, or Development approval.
      3.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required
to document the proposed Development's proportionate share of System
Improvements Costs, then the City and the Fee Payer shall jointly select an
individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The Fee
Payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the Fee Payer agrees to a longer time.
      4.   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to: (a)
pay the proportionate share of System Improvements Costs documented by the
supplemental study; or (b) modify the proposed Development to reduce such
costs; or (c) withdraw the application.
      5.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay the System Improvements Costs
documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to
writing between the City and the Fee Payer prior to review and consideration of
any application for any Development approval or Building Permit related to the
proposed Development.
      6.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the
proportionate share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this ordinance shall obligate the City to approve Development
that results in an Extraordinary Impact to the City. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-10: FEE PAYER REFUNDS:
   A.   Duty to Refund:
      1.   An Impact Fee shall be refunded to a Fee Payer, or successor in
interest, or a property owner in the following circumstances:
         a.   Service is available but never provided;
         b.   A Building Permit, or permit for installation of a manufactured
home, is denied or abandoned;
         c.   The Fee Payer pays an Impact Fee under protest and a subsequent
review of the fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment determines
that the fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which the City was
entitled to receive;
         d.   The City has collected an Impact Fee and the City has failed to
Appropriate or expend the collected fees pursuant to this Title; or
         e.   Failure of the City to commence construction or encumber the
funds in the Capital Projects Fund.
      2.   Any Impact Fee paid shall be refunded if the City has failed to
commence construction of System Improvements in accordance with this chapter,
or to appropriate funds for such construction, within eight (8) years after the
date on which such fee was collected by the City. Any refund due shall be paid
to the owner of record of the parcel for which the City's Impact Fee was paid.
The City may hold Impact Fees for longer than eight (8) years but in no event
longer than eleven (11) years from the date collected if the City identifies in
writing: (a) a reasonable cause why the fees should be held longer than eight
(8) years; and (b) an anticipated date by which the fees will be expended. If
the City complies with the previous sentence, then any Impact Fees so
identified shall be refunded to the Fee Payer if the City has failed to
commence construction of System Improvements in accordance with the written
notice, or to Appropriate Funds for such construction on or before the date
identified in such writing.
      3.   After an Impact Fee has been paid pursuant to this chapter and after
a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the City, no refund of any part
of such fee shall be made if the project for which the fee was paid is later
demolished, destroyed, or is altered, reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to
reduce the size of the project or the number of units in the project.
      4.   Each refund shall include a refund of interest at one-half the legal
rate provided for in Idaho Code § 28-22-104 from the date on which the fee was
originally paid.
   B.   Process: The City shall make a determination of whether a refund is due
within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request for a refund from
the Fee Payer, successor in interest, or an owner of record of the property for
which the fee was paid. When the right to a refund exists, the City shall send
the refund within ninety (90) days after the City determines that a refund is
due. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-11: ESTABLISHMENT OF CAPITAL PROJECTS FUND; FUND ACCOUNTS:
   A.   Capital Projects Funds Established. The Capital Projects Fund will be
maintained by the City for the purpose of ensuring that all Impact Fees
collected, pursuant to this chapter, are used to address impacts reasonably
attributable to new Development for which the Impact Fees are paid. The Capital
Projects Fund shall have its own interest-bearing Account. The interest earned
on the account pursuant to Idaho Code § 67-8210(1) shall not be governed by
Idaho Code § 57-127, as it may be amended, but shall be considered funds of the
Capital Projects Fund and shall be subject to the same restrictions on uses of
funds as the Impact Fees on which the interest is generated.
   B.   Deposit of Impact Fees. All monies paid by a Fee Payer, pursuant to
this chapter, shall be identified as Impact Fees and upon receipt by the City
shall be promptly deposited in the Capital Projects Fund Account.
      1.   Monies in the Capital Projects Fund Account shall be spent in the
order collected, on a first- in/first-out basis.
      2.   The City shall maintain and keep accurate financial records for the
Account which records shall:
         a.   Show the source and disbursement of all revenues;
         b.   Account for all monies received;

used solely and exclusively for the provisions of projects specified in the
Capital Improvements Plan; and
         d.   Provide an annual accounting for the Impact Fee Capital Projects
Fund Account showing the source and amount of all funds collected and the
projects that were funded, which annual accounting shall be provided to the
City as part of the annual audit process of this chapter. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-12: EXPENDITURE OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Expenditures. Expenditures of Impact Fees collected and deposited in
the Capital Projects Fund shall be made only for System Improvements within the
Service Area for which the Impact Fee was collected in accordance with the
Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   Capital Improvements Plan Reimbursement; Surcharge. A portion of each
Impact Fee collected may be designated as a surcharge for reimbursement for the
cost of preparing the Capital Improvements Plan in accordance with Idaho Code §
67-8208. The surcharge shall not exceed the Development's proportionate share
of the cost of preparing the Capital Improvements Plan. (Ord. 617, 2-14-2023)
5A-1-13: APPEALS, PROTEST AND MEDIATION:
   A.   Appeals. Any Fee Payer that is or may be obligated to pay an Impact
Fee, individual assessment or an Extraordinary Impact, or that claims a right
to receive a refund, reimbursement, exemption or credit under this chapter, and
who is dissatisfied with a decision made either by the City in applying this
chapter, may appeal such decision. The Fee Payer shall have the burden on
appeal of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the decision was in
error.
   B.   Appeal Process.
      1.   Appeals of denials of an exemption from Impact Fees under this
Title.

notice of appeal shall include a statement describing why the Fee Payer
believes that the appealed decision was in error, together with copies of any
documents that the Fee Payer believes support the claim.
         b.   The City shall schedule a hearing in front of the City Council
within thirty (30) days of receiving the appeal. The Fee Payer or its
representative shall have a right to be present and to present evidence in
support of the appeal. The City personnel who made the decision under appeal or
their representatives shall likewise have the right to be present and to
present evidence in support of the decision.
         c.   The City Council shall consider the decision denying the
exemption and also consider any additional evidence that may be offered by the
Fee Payer and City staff. The City Council may affirm, reverse, or modify in
whole or in part the decision appealed from and issue a written decision within
thirty (30) days.
         d.   A final decision of the City Council may be judicially reviewed
pursuant to Idaho Code § 31-1506.
      2.   Appeals of impact fee schedule assessments, refunds, reimbursements,
credits, individual assessments, or extraordinary impacts under this chapter.
         a.   The Fee Payer shall file a written notice of the appeal with the
City within thirty (30) days after the date of the City's decision, or the date
on which the Fee Payer submitted a payment of the Impact Fee under protest,
whichever is later. Such written application shall include a statement
describing why the Fee Payer believes that the appealed decision was in error,
together with copies of any documents that the Fee Payer believes support the
claim.
         b.   The City Council shall hear the appeal within sixty (60) days
after receipt of a written notice of appeal. The Fee Payer or its
representative shall have a right to be present and to present evidence in
support of the appeal. The City personnel who made the decision under appeal or
their representatives shall likewise have the right to be present and to
present evidence in support of the decision. The criteria to be used by the
City Council in considering the appeal shall be whether: (a) the decision or
interpretation made by the City or (b) the alternative decision or
interpretation offered by the Fee Payer, more accurately reflects the intent of
this chapter that new development in the Service Area pay its proportionate
share of the costs of system improvements to public facilities necessary to
serve new development and whether the chapter has been correctly applied. The
City Council shall issue a decision upholding, reversing, or modifying the
decision being appealed within thirty (30) days after hearing the appeal.
   C.   Payment Under Protest. A Fee Payer may pay an Impact Fee under protest
in order not to delay in the issuance of a Building Permit by the City. A Fee
Payer making a payment under protest shall not be estopped from exercising the
right to appeal provided herein, nor shall such Fee Payer be estopped from
receiving a refund of any amount deemed to have been illegally collected.
   D.   Mediation.
      1.   Any Fee Payer that has a disagreement with a decision made by the
City regarding an Impact Fee determination that is or may be due for a proposed
Development pursuant to this chapter, may enter into a voluntary agreement with
the City as the case may be, to subject the disagreement to mediation by a
qualified independent party acceptable to both parties to the mediation.
      2.   Mediation may take place at any time following the filing of a
timely appeal, or as an alternative to such appeal, provided that the request
for mediation is filed no later than the last date on which a timely appeal
could be filed pursuant to this section.
      3.   Participation in mediation does not preclude the Fee Payer from
pursuing other remedies provided for in this section.
      4.   If mediation is requested, any related mediation costs shall be
shared equally by the parties to the mediation, and a written agreement
regarding the payment of such costs shall be executed prior to the commencement
of mediation.
      5.   In the event that mediation does not resolve the issues, the Fee
Payer retains all rights of appeal as set forth in this section. (Ord. 617, 2-
14-2023)

5A-1-17: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from requiring a
Developer to construct reasonable Project Improvements, as are required by the
fire codes and other rules that are adopted by the state    fire marshal, in
conjunction with a Development.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit
private agreements between property owners or developers, the Idaho
Transportation Department and governmental entities in regard to the
construction or installation of System Improvements or providing for credits or
reimbursements for System Improvements Costs incurred by a Developer including
inter-project transfers of credits or providing for reimbursement for Project

of revenue.
   H.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a
Project for which a complete application for a Building Permit has been
received by the City, prior to the effective date of this chapter, shall not be
subject to the Impact Fee imposed by this chapter. If the resulting Building
Permit is later revised or replaced after the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, and the new Building Permit(s) reflects a development
density, intensity, development size or number of Service Units more than ten
percent (10%) higher than that reflected in the original Building Permit, then
the Impact Fee may be charged on the difference in density, intensity,
development size or number of Service Units between the original and the
revised or replacement Building Permit.
   I.   Any monies, including any accrued interest not assigned to specific
System Improvements within such Capital Improvements Plan and not expended or
refunded pursuant to this chapter shall be retained in the same account until
the next fiscal year.
   J.   If the City discovers an error in the Capital Improvements Plan that

the collection of any Impact Fees until the error is corrected by ordinance.
   K.   If Impact Fees are calculated and paid based on a mistake or
misrepresentation, they shall be recalculated. Any amounts overpaid by a Fee

TITLE 5B
PARMA RURAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
CHAPTER 1
SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY, FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
SECTION:
5B-1-1: Short Title
5B-1-2: Authority
5B-1-3: Applicability
5B-1-4: Findings
5B-1-5: Purpose
5B-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
This title shall be known and may be cited as the Parma Rural Fire Protection
District Development Impact Fees Ordinance. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-1-2: AUTHORITY:
This title is enacted pursuant to the City of Parma's (the “City”) general
police powers, its authority to enact ordinances, and its authority as provided
by the Idaho Development Impact Fee Act codified at Chapter 82 of Title 67,
Idaho Code (the “Act”) and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho to
impose development impact fees; and the City's and the Parma Rural Fire
Protection District's authority to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement
and to impose, collect, and expend development impact fees as provided in I.C.
§ 67-8204A. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-1-3: APPLICABILITY:
Except as otherwise exempt in section
5B-5-11, these provisions shall apply to the development of property located
within the unincorporated area within the boundaries of the City of Parma,
Idaho. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-1-4: FINDINGS:
   A.   Parma Rural Fire Protection District (“the District”) is a taxing
District organized and existing by virtue of Chapter 14 of Title 31, Idaho
Code, and the District's boundaries include all areas within the City limits
and areas surrounding the City; and
   B.   The District's duty and responsibility is to provide protection of
property against fire and the preservation of life and enforcement of any of
the fire codes and other rules that are adopted by the state fire marshal; and
   C.   The City is experiencing considerable growth and Development; and
   D.   The purposes of the Act are set forth in I.C. § 67-8202 as follows:
      1.   Ensure that adequate Public Facilities are available to serve new
growth and Development; and
      2.   Promote orderly growth and Development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments, such as the City and the District, may
require those who benefit from new growth and Development pay development
impact fees for their Proportionate Share of the costs of new Public Facilities
needed to serve new growth and Development; and
      3.   Establish minimum standards for adoption of development impact fee
ordinances by Cities; and
      4.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and Development are
required to pay no more than their Proportionate Share of the cost of Public
Facilities needed to serve that new growth and Development and to prevent
duplicate and ad hoc Development Requirements; and
      5.   To empower Cities to adopt ordinances to impose development impact
fees.
   E.   The Act does not authorize the District to enact a development impact
fee ordinance; and
   F.   The Act, under I.C. § 67-8204A, allows the City and the District to
enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement in situations where both are affected
by significant growth and development (as is currently happening within the
City). The intergovernmental agreement provides for the collection and
expenditure of development impact fees for System Improvements by creating a
new funding mechanism for the District's incurred System Improvements Costs in
order to meet the demand and growth within the City. Moreover, the agreement
promotes orderly growth and development while safeguarding the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the City's residents and property owners; and
   G.   New growth within the City imposes and will impose increasing and
excessive demands upon the existing District's capital facilities; and
   H.   New growth within the City is expected to continue, and will place
ever-increasing demands on the District to provide and expand the District's
capital facilities to serve that new growth; and
   I.   The tax revenues generated from new Development within the City often
do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements and
expansion of the existing District capital facilities to accommodate for that
new growth; and
   J.   Section 67-8204A of the Act authorizes the City to adopt an impact fee
system and to enter into the Intergovernmental Agreement with the District to
offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the needed improvements costs to
the District's capital facilities caused by new growth and Development in the
City; and
   K.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system facilitated by the
Intergovernmental Agreement with the District, will promote the purposes set
forth in the Act, in that it would:
      1.   Ensure that adequate District Capital Facilities are available to
serve new growth and Development;
      2.   Promote orderly growth and Development by establishing uniform
standards by which the City may require that those who benefit from new growth
and Development pay a Proportionate Share of the cost of new District Capital
Facilities needed to serve new growth and Development in the City;
      3.   Establish minimum standards for the adoption of District impact
fees;
      4.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and Development are
required to pay no more than their Proportionate Share of the cost of District
Capital Facilities needed to serve new growth and Development in the City; and
      5.   Prevent duplicate and ad hoc Development Requirements in the City;
and
   L.   The Capital Improvements Plan contains the Capital Improvements planned
by the District during the term of the Capital Improvements Plan, and such
element has been developed in conformance with the requirements of Chapter 82
of Title 67, Idaho Code; and
   M.   The Capital Improvements Plan sets forth reasonable methodologies and
analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new Development on the
District's capital facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities
created by new Development; and
   N.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the Capital Improvements Plan was based
on actual System Improvements costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. In
addition, the Capital Improvements Plan uses a fee calculation methodology that
is the net of credits for the Present Value of revenues that will be generated
by new growth and Development based on historical funding patterns and that are
anticipated to be available to pay for System Improvements, including taxes,
assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers; and
   O.   The District impact fees established by this title are based on the
Capital Improvements Plan, and do not exceed System Improvements costs required
to serve new Development that will pay the District Impact Fees; and
   P.   The District's capital facilities, included in the calculation of fees
in the Capital Improvements Plans, will benefit all new residential Development
throughout the City, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the
City as a single Service Area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and
spending the District Impact Fees collected from Developers; and
   Q.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
Development impacts created by each type of Development covered by this title,
which includes the development impact fees assessment of such Development
covered by this title and the development impact fees that such Developer will
be required to pay; and
   R.   This title creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
Developers will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the costs
incurred by the District to construct and/or purchase System Improvements in
ways that benefit the Development for which each development impact fee was
paid within a reasonable period of time after the development impact fee is
paid, and in conformance with I.C. § 67-8210; and
   S.   This title creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any District Capital
Facilities, or to replace or rehabilitate existing District Capital Facilities,
or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those facilities; and
   T.   This title creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of development impact fees, in accordance with I.C. § 67-8204(19); and
   U.   This title is consistent with all applicable provisions of the Act
concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-1-5: PURPOSE:
   A.   This title is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement the
Capital Improvements Plan; and
   B.   The intent of this title is to ensure that new Development bears a
Proportionate Share of the cost of System Improvements; to ensure that such
Proportionate Share does not exceed the cost of such System Improvements
required to accommodate new Development; and to ensure that funds collected
from new Development are used for System Improvements in accordance with the
Act; and
   C.   It is the further intent of this title to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of System Improvements to
new Development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by the Act; and
   D.   It is not the intent of this title to collect more money from any new
Development than the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for System
Improvements created by such new Development; and
   E.   It is the intent of this title that any monies collected, as imposed
District Impact Fees, are deposited in the District Impact Fees Capital
Projects Trust Fund account, are never commingled with monies from a different
impact fee account, are never used for a development impact fee component
different from that for which the fee was paid, are never used to correct
current deficiencies in the District's capital facilities, and are never used
to replace, rehabilitate, maintain, or operate any District Capital Facilities.

626, 11-1-2024)
5B-3-2: CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN:
   A.   The District has planned for the improvement of the District's Capital
Facilities in the Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the City to
accommodate new Development, and would assist the District in implementing the
Capital Improvements element of the Capital Improvements Plan.
   C.   In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the District's
facilities, the City and District adopt, by resolution, the District's Capital
Improvements Plan. A qualified professional in fields related to finance,
engineering, planning, and transportation shall be hired by the District to
assist the Advisory Committee in the preparation of the study.
   D.   The methodology used in the Capital Improvements Plan, as applied
through this title, must comply with all applicable provisions of Idaho law,
including those set forth in I.C. §§ 67-8204(1), (2), (16) and (23), 67-8207
and 67-8209. The incorporation of the Capital Improvements Plan satisfies the
requirement in I.C. § 67-8204(16) for a detailed description of the methodology
by which the District impact fees are calculated, and the requirement in I.C. §
67-8204(24) for a description of acceptable levels of service for District's
System Improvements.
   E.   In determining the Proportionate Share of the District's System
Improvements Costs, the Capital Improvements Plan shall consider:
      1.   The cost of the existing System Improvements; and
      2.   How the existing System Improvements have been financed; and
      3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements Costs through taxation, assessment, or Developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements Costs
through Developer or landowner contributions; and
      4.   The extent to which the new Development is required to contribute to
System Improvements Costs in the future; and
      5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area or areas; and
      6.   Extraordinary Costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development; and
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, special taxation and a plan for alternative
sources of revenue. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)

Costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. The amount of the District impact
fees shall be calculated using the methodology contained in the Capital
Improvements Plan. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-3-6: PROPORTIONATE SHARE DETERMINATION:
District impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula or method
under which the District impact fees imposed do not exceed a Proportionate
Share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the District in the provision
of System Improvements to serve the new Development. The Proportionate Share is
the costs attributable to the new Development after the District consider the
following:
   A.   Any appropriate credit, offset, contribution of money, dedication of
land or construction of System Improvements; and
   B.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a new
Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments; and
   C.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the District
for System Improvements; and
   D.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.

Share; or
   B.   Discontinue the collection of any District impact fees until the error
is corrected by ordinance. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)

   F.   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such as
tennis court or a clubhouse, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the use
creates a significant impact on the capacity of System Improvements; or
   G.   The installation of a Modular Building, Manufactured/Mobile Home or
Recreational Vehicle if the Fee Payer can demonstrate by documentation such as
utility bills and tax records that either:
      1.   Modular Building, Manufactured/Mobile Home or Recreational Vehicle
was legally in place on the lot or space prior to the effective date of this
title; or
      2.   A District impact fee has been paid previously for the Modular
Building, Manufactured/Mobile Home or Recreational Vehicle on that same lot or

CHAPTER 6
INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT
SECTION:
5B-6-1: Individual Assessment Process
5B-6-1: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS:
   A.   In lieu of calculating the amount of District impact fees due pursuant
to section
5B-5-2 and the Capital Improvements Plan, a Fee Payer may file a request with
the City that the required amount of District Impact Fees be determined by the
Administrator through an individual assessment for the proposed Development. A
request for an individual assessment process shall involve consideration of
studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by the Fee Payer to
adjust the amount of District impact fees due. If a Fee Payer files a request
for the use of an individual assessment, the Fee Payer shall be responsible for
retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment that
complies with the requirements of this chapter, at the Fee Payer's expense. The
Fee Payer shall, at the Fee Payer's expense, bear the burden of proving by
clear and convincing evidence that the resulting individual assessment complies
with the requirements of this chapter. The Fee Payer shall bear the burden of
proving by clear and convincing evidence that the resulting individual
assessment is a more accurate measure of its Proportionate Share of the cost of
System Improvements, based on the District's adopted levels of service, than
the development impact fees that would otherwise be due pursuant to section
5B-5-2 and the Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same Level of Service
standards and unit costs for System Improvements used in the Capital
Improvements Plan, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost) methodology,
and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions used.
   C.   A request for an individual assessment shall be delivered and filed
with the City at any time that the number of dwelling units in the proposed
Development and the types and amounts of Development in each non-residential
category identified in Section
5B-5-2 and the Capital Improvements Plan is known. Upon filing a request for
individual assessment, the City shall transmit the request to the Administrator
for review. The Administrator shall issue a written decision within thirty (30)
days following receipt of a completed request for individual assessment
together with all supporting information from the Fee Payer, so as not to
unreasonably delay the Developer's (Fee Payer's) subsequent applications to the
City for Building Permits.
   D.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the Administrator may
then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by the Administrator
as the basis for calculating District impact fees. The criteria for acceptance,
rejection or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual
assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for System Improvements element
(s) created by the proposed Development, or the costs of those facilities, than
the applicable fee shown in the fee schedule attached to the Capital
Improvements Plan.
   E.   The decision by the Administrator on an application for an individual
assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the District
impact fees, shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the District
impact fee is intended to be used, and shall include an explanation of those
factors identified in I.C. § 67-8207.
   F.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with modifications
by the Administrator, then the District impact fees due under this title for
such Development shall be calculated according to such individual assessment.
   G.   The Administrator shall provide notice of final determination of an
individual assessment to the Developer (Fee Payer) and the City. (Ord. 626, 11-
1-2024)

When a Developer or their predecessor in title or interest has constructed
System Improvements of the same category as a District Capital Improvements
Element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards the completion of
System Improvements of the same category as a District Capital Improvements
Element, and the District has accepted such construction, contribution or
dedication, the District shall issue a credit, in accordance with the
provisions of this title, against the District impact fees otherwise due for
the same District Capital Improvements Element in connection with the proposed
Development. As set forth in this section, a credit shall be issued regardless
of whether the contribution or dedication to System Improvements was required
by the District as a condition of Development or was offered by the Developer
and accepted by the District in writing, and regardless of whether the
contribution or dedication was contributed by the Developer or by a local
improvement district controlled by the Developer. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-7-2: CREDITS LIMITATIONS:
Credits against a District impact fee shall not be given for:
   A.   Project Improvements; or
   B.   Any construction, contribution, or dedication not agreed to in writing
by the District prior to commencement of the construction, contribution, or
dedication. Credits issued for one Capital Improvements Element may not be used
to reduce the impact fee due for a different capital improvement. No credits
shall be issued for System Improvements contributed or dedicated prior to the
effective date of this chapter. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-7-3: VALUATION OF CREDIT AT PRESENT VALUE:
   A.   Land. Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the Fee Payer's
option, be valued at the Present Value of:
      1.   One hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the county assessor; or
      2.   That fair market value established by a private appraiser acceptable
to the District in an appraisal paid for by the Fee Payer.
   B.   Improvements. Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall be valued by the District at the Present Value of
such improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the Fee Payer to the District. The
Administrator shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information
submitted, or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or
unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to
the District as a more accurate measure of the value of the offered System
Improvements to the District. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)
5B-7-4: WHEN CREDITS BECOME EFFECTIVE:
   A.   Land. Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the District in a form acceptable to the
District, at no cost to the District, and has been accepted by the District.
Upon request of the Fee Payer, the District shall issue a letter stating the
amount of credit available.
   B.   Improvements. Approved credits for acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall generally become effective when:

by the District;
      2.   A suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and
approved by the District; and
      3.   All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the District and the State of Idaho.

5B-7-5: CREDIT REQUEST PROCEDURES:
   A.   Request. In order to obtain a credit against a District Impact Fee
otherwise due, a Fee Payer shall submit to the Administrator a written offer of
request to dedicate to the District specific parcels of qualifying land or a
written offer to contribute or construct specific System Improvements to the
District Capital Facilities in accordance with all applicable state or City
design and construction standards, and shall specifically request a credit
against the type of District impact fee for which the land dedication or System
Improvements is offered.
   B.   Review. After receipt of the written offer of request for credit, the
Administrator shall review the request and determine whether the land or System
Improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing District
Capital Facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If
the Administrator determines that the offered credit satisfies the criteria and
will be acceptable to the Fire Fire District Commissioners, then the credit
shall be issued. The District shall complete its review and determination of an
application within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application for credit.
   C.   Credits exceeding fee amounts due. If the credit due to a Fee Payer
exceeds the District impact fees that would otherwise be due from the Fee Payer
pursuant to this title (whether calculated through the fee schedule attached to
the capital improvement plan or through an independent assessment), the Fee
Payer may choose to receive such credit in the form of either:
      1.   A credit against future District impact fees due for the same System
Improvements; or
      2.   A reimbursement for District impact fees paid by future Development
that impacts the System Improvements contributed or dedicated by the Fee Payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the Fee Payer, the District shall
be under no obligation to use any District funds - other than District impact
fees paid by other Development for the same System Improvements - to reimburse
the Fee Payer for any credit in excess of the District impact fee that are due.
   D.   Written agreement required. If credit or reimbursement is due to the
Fee Payer pursuant to this section, the District shall enter into a written
agreement with the Fee Payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the System Improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide the amount of credit or the amount,
time, and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years.
   E.   The Administrator's determination on the written offer of request for
credit shall be provided to the Fee Payer and the City. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)

whether the proposed Development generates Extraordinary Impact that will
result in extraordinary Systems Improvements Costs. Such notice shall include a
statement that the potential impacts of such Development on System Improvements
are not adequately addressed by the Capital Improvements Plan, and that a
supplemental study, at the Fee Payer's expense will be required.
   C.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of Extraordinary Impact
include, but are not limited to:

Improvements Costs related to the proposed Development; or
      2.   Modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary Impact; or
      3.   Withdraw the application for certification, a Building Permit, or
Development.
   E.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed Development's Proportionate Share of System Improvements
Costs, then the District and the Fee Payer shall jointly select an individual
or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The Fee Payer shall
enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization to pay the
costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental study to be
completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement unless the Fee
Payer agrees to a longer time.
   F.   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to:
      1.   Pay the Proportionate Share of System Improvements Costs documented
by the supplemental study; or
      2.   Modify the proposed Development to reduce such costs; or
      3.   Withdraw the application.

in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to writing between
the District and the Fee Payer prior to review and consideration of any
application for any Development or Building Permit related to the proposed
Development.
   H.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the Proportionate
Share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental study,
nothing in this title shall obligate the City to approve Development that
results in an Extraordinary Impact to the District. (Ord. 626, 11-1-2024)

(varying height: minimum 3 feet, maximum 5 feet; 2.5:1 side slopes) and fence
(varying height) to a total height of not less than six feet (6') or greater
than eight feet (8') in a twenty four foot (24') (minimum) easement dedicated
for traffic buffer area. Screening shall be harmonious with adjacent screening
techniques, materials, and colors.
   B.   Alignment: Alignment shall be curving or patterned, and mixed with
designated landscaping to mitigate visual impact. For each portion of three
hundred thirty feet (330') along right of way, breaks featuring landscaped
cutouts (200 square feet) may be employed to alter linear visual effects.
   C.   Gates: No vehicular gate or access shall be permitted onto a collector
or arterial street from the rear yard of a lot.
   D.   Setbacks: Rear setbacks may be reduced to fifteen feet (15') from the
buffer easement line.
   E.   Maintenance: Maintenance of the public side of buffer area shall be by
the subdivision homeowners' association; use and maintenance of the private
side of the buffer area shall be by the abutting lot owner. This shall be
provided for in the protective covenants. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-3-7: PUBLIC SITES, NATURAL FEATURES, AND OPEN SPACE:
Public sites, natural features and open space area designations shall conform
to the following standards:
   A.   Public Areas: Where it is determined that a proposed park, playground,
school or other public use as shown on a future acquisition map, as authorized
by Idaho Code, is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision,
the planning and zoning commission shall notify the appropriate public agency
concerning the land proposed to be acquired. Within thirty (30) days of the
date of notice, the public agency may request the governing body to suspend
consideration on the proposed subdivision for sixty (60) days. However, if an
agreement is not reached within sixty (60) days, the commission shall resume
consideration of the subdivision.
   B.   Natural Features: Existing natural features, which add value to
residential development and enhance the attractiveness of the community (such
as trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets), shall
be preserved in the design of the subdivision or development, unless waived by
the city council when considering the preliminary plat application.
   C.   Special Development: In the case of planned unit developments, and
large scale developments, the open space area requirement shall be a minimum of
ten percent (10%) of the gross area and shall not include strips of land less
than fifteen feet (15') in width unless designed to accommodate a water feature
such as a pond or stream.
   D.   Open Spaces:
      1.   The minimum percentage of the gross area that must be set aside in
the first phase of development for open space in new noncommercial subdivisions
or planned unit developments shall be ten percent (10%) unless waived by the
city council when considering the preliminary plat.
      2.   Open spaces shall be in building lot size increments and at least
sixty percent (60%) shall be in a single tract having width to length ratios no
greater than three to one (3:1) unless designed to accommodate a water feature
such as a pond or stream. When designed around a water feature, the length to
width ratio may be waived. Open space includes the area designed for greenbelt
or storm water retention facilities.
      3.   Open spaces shall include at least one 3-inch caliper tree for every
three thousand (3,000) square feet of surface area. Such trees shall be
selected from the choice of species provided in
title 5, chapter 8 of this code, and shall comply with both the spirit and
letter of that chapter, as appropriate, regarding placement and compatibility
with existing and future anticipated subsurface, surface and overhead uses at
the site, including sidewalks, streets, overhead utilities, underground
utilities, traffic and pedestrian sightlines, etc.
   E.   Maintenance Of Open Space, Common Area, And/Or Greenbelt: The council
and city attorney shall review the homeowners' agreement or initiate an
agreement with the developer for maintenance of common and/or open space areas
within the subdivision or development by the homeowners' association.
   F.   Greenbelts: Greenbelts, or easements for future greenbelts, are
required along floodplains and permanent drainageways. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-3-8: AREA OF IMPACT:
   A.   Annexation: New subdivisions which are contiguous to the city limits
and meet the criteria for annexation as set forth in Idaho Code section 50-222,
shall be annexed and developed to city standards.
   B.   Streets: Where parcels of land are subdivided into unusually large lots
(such as when large lots are approved for septic tanks), the parcels shall be
divided, where feasible, to allow for future division into smaller parcels. Lot
arrangements shall allow for the ultimate extension of adjacent streets through
the middle of wide blocks. Whenever such future subdividing, developing or lot
splitting is contemplated, the plan thereof shall show proposed extension of
streets and be approved by the commission and council prior to the taking of
such action.
   C.   Utilities:
      1.   Water: New subdivision developments which are platted in less than
five (5) acre lots that do not connect to public water facilities shall provide
a central water system (dry lines may be required), designed to city standards,
so at the time of annexation, connecting to the public water system will be
more cost effective and easily accomplished.
      2.   Sewer: Unless otherwise provided for herein, new development shall
provide a sewer utility system or a dry line system which is equivalent to the
public sewer system so, at the time of annexation, connecting to the public
sewer system will be more easily accomplished. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-3-9: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT:
A storm water management plan shall be prepared addressing both construction
and postconstruction control of storm water. The introductory comments, general
storm water requirements, control method requirements, storm water best
management practices, and all appendices contained in the city of Boise "Storm
Water Management Design Manual", are incorporated herein by reference and shall
be used for the development and review of storm water plans for subdivisions
and development. References to the city of Boise shall be read as if references
to the city of Parma. References to the Ada County highway district (ACHD) may
be deleted as appropriate. Checklists and other references shall be
incorporated and used for the city of Parma.
   A.   When possible, retention and detention facilities should be designed as
open surface facilities for multi-use. The inlet shall be located within a
narrow neck containing the outlet and emergency overflow to minimize mixing of
first flush (high pollution concentration) storm water with that from longer
duration flows.
   B.   A plan for operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the
facility shall be prepared and submitted to the city for approval. Oil/water
separators and catch basin inserts shall not be used alone to treat storm water
runoff, but rather in combination with other BMPs to improve water quality. For
grease and sediment traps, sand filters and other maintenance intensive
facilities, a life cycle cost including cost of replacement shall be submitted
and will be considered by the city as a part of the process of deciding on
acceptance or nonacceptance of that option. Generally, for facilities requiring
city maintenance, an option with least postconstruction life cycle cost will be
preferred.
   C.   Retention facilities which incorporate absorption trenches and
subsurface infiltration elements for storm water management shall conform to
Idaho Code title 42, chapter 39, and to the Idaho department of water resources
rules for waste disposal and injection wells.
   D.   All developments and/or subdivisions which are required by the
environmental protection agency to provide a "storm water pollution prevention
plan", shall submit a copy of said plan to the city prior to commencing any
construction activity. Preconstruction erosion and sedimentation control
methods must be installed or otherwise in effect prior to any site disturbance.
(Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)

drawings for all improvements required in the portion of the subdivision
contained in the final plat.
   D.   One Year Guarantee: The owner/subdivider shall guarantee all
improvements within the public right of way and any other public dedication for
a one year period following the date of final inspection and acceptance by the
city. Any defects, repairs or maintenance during the one year guarantee period
due to faulty workmanship or materials shall be corrected at the expense of the
owner/subdivider.
   E.   Financial Guarantee:
      1.   Before recording the final plat, the subdivider shall construct all
required improvements and secure a certification of completion from the city
engineer; or, shall provide to the city a certified check, irrevocable letter
of credit, or other acceptable guarantee in a form approved by the city
attorney in an amount of one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the
estimated cost of improvements to be installed, to ensure actual construction
of such improvements; or, shall execute a written agreement with the city
setting forth phases of development, anticipated schedules for construction and
a certified check, irrevocable letter of credit, or other acceptable guarantee
in a form approved by the city attorney, for each phase of construction. The
improvements, when covered by a certified check, irrevocable letter of credit,
or other acceptable guarantee in a form approved by the city attorney, shall be
constructed within six (6) months from the date of recording of the final plat;
provided, however, the council may extend the period an additional six (6)
months upon showing of just cause by the subdivider.
      2.   The building official shall not issue building permits until
evidence has been provided that all necessary improvements have been installed
and accepted and an inspection and certification that cleanup has been done or
a certified check, irrevocable letter of credit, or other acceptable guarantee
in a form approved by the city attorney in an amount of one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the cost has been filed with the city.
      3.   Before the certified check, irrevocable letter of credit, or other
acceptable guarantee in a form approved by the city attorney in the amount of
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the estimated cost of improvements is
returned to the developer, the city requires as built drawings be submitted and
accepted by the city engineer. Amounts of less than sixty thousand dollars
($60,000.00) will not be released until all the work has been completed,
inspected, and accepted by the city.
      4.   All weather driving surfaces, functional water and sewer, and street
signs shall be fully complete and accepted before the city will consider a
guarantee for the balance of improvements. The city may consider a guarantee
for the balance of improvements only when extenuating circumstances exist, such
as adverse weather conditions or shortages in necessary materials.
      5.   A certificate of occupancy will not be issued until any damage to
the subdivision improvements by the homebuilder is repaired.
   F.   Record Plans And Specifications:
      1.   Prior to acceptance by the council of any improvements installed by
the subdivider, two (2) sets of prints of the approved "record" plans and
specifications, along with a digital copy of the approved "record" plans and
specifications in a format usable by the city, shall be certified by the
subdivider's engineer and filed with the administrator.
      2.   Within ten (10) days after completion of improvements and submission
of "record" plans in accordance with council specifications, the council or its
designated representative shall certify the completion and acceptance of the
construction and shall transmit a copy of the said certification to the
subdivider. If a surety agreement has been executed by the subdivider, the same
shall be forwarded to the city treasurer. The city treasurer shall thereafter
release said surety or guarantee upon application by the subdivider.
   G.   Certificate Of Occupancy: Construction of all required improvements for
the subdivision or phase of development shall be completed and accepted by the
city and any other approving agency prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy within the subdivision or phase. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-4-2: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Minimum Improvements: It shall be the responsibility of the owner or
subdivider to construct in accordance with city standards and specifications
the following minimum improvements for the subdivision/development:
      1.   Curbs And Gutters: Curb and gutters shall be installed on both sides
of all roads. All functionally classified roads shall include six inch (6")
straight curbs. Other local streets may have three inch (3") rolled curbs upon
approval by the city engineer. Other variations may be approved if deemed
appropriate by the city council.
      2.   Sidewalks: Concrete sidewalks on both sides of the street may be
adjacent to the curb or may be meandering, with a landscape strip between
sidewalk and street. Except as where otherwise provided for below, all such
sidewalks shall have pavement at least five feet (5') wide along functionally
classified streets, and at least four feet (4') wide along local streets. Where
a configuration involving a landscape strip is implemented, the developer shall
ensure that the subdivision's covenants, conditions and restrictions provide
that either the homeowner, or the homeowners' association, if more appropriate,
maintain the landscape strip. For areas encompassed and affected by
title 5, chapter 9, "Gateway Street Beautification", of this code, all
specifications and requirements relating to sidewalks will be governed by the
requirements and provisions found therein.
      3.   Pedestrian Walkways: Pedestrian walkways, when required and/or
provided, shall have easements at least twenty feet (20') wide and pavement at
least seven feet (7') wide. All developments shall provide safe pedestrian and
bicycle access throughout the development that connects with existing and
proposed pedestrian and bicycle routes as shown in the Parma comprehensive
plan.
      4.   Storm Water Disposal: The management of storm water shall conform
with the city of Parma's storm water management policy (section
6-3-9 of this title).
      5.   Utilities: The extension of utilities shall be at the developer's
expense and shall have the capacity and placement necessary to serve land
located farther out. Such utilities include underground power, telephone and
street lighting. Concerning the provision of extension for water and sewer
lines, unless waived by council in favor of another plan which substantially
accomplishes the goals of this section, water and sewer lines shall be extended
and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sections
 6-4-3 and
6-4-4 of this chapter, respectively.
      6.   Sanitary Sewer System: Connection to city sewer is required.
Approval of the subdivision shall be based on treatment capabilities, such as
density requirements, the need for entirely new systems and other treatment
possibilities that are in harmony with officially recognized practices of the
city.
      7.   Domestic Water System:
         a.   Connection to city water is required. Water hookups shall be
allowed only within the city limits unless approved by the council upon
recommendation of the city engineer.
         b.   If the city requires a larger water main to accommodate future
development than the size of line required by the city for the subdivision/
development, the developer shall install the larger line size required by the
city. If the developer is required to install a well under this provision, and
when appropriate, the city may waive the development's hookup fees up to the
cost of the well.
         c.   Four inch (4") blowoffs for water lines (city standard) shall be
required at the terminus of all dead end main lines unless a standard fire
hydrant is available.
      8.   Monuments: Monuments shall be set in accordance with Idaho Code
section 50-1303. Monuments shall be placed at all section and quarter corners,
and elsewhere as required by the city engineer. All monuments located in paved
streets, alleys or sidewalks will be encased in protective boxes approved by
the city engineer. For each subdivision phase or development, any portion of
which is located within a regulated floodplain, one elevation monument setting
forth the elevation and datum shall be located within a monument box and shall
be filed as a corner perpetuation record, as well as identified on the record
drawings. The location of the monument shall be approved by the city engineer.
      9.   Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be installed by the subdivider in
locations specified by the city, every three hundred feet (300'), or as
determined by the uniform fire code and the Parma rural fire district.
      10.   Street Name Signs: Street name signs shall be installed in the
appropriate locations at each street intersection. Cost of street signs shall
be the responsibility of the developer and the signs shall be installed to city
specifications.
      11.   Streetlights: Streetlights shall be required to be installed by the
subdivider/developer at the intersections, along adjacent roadways and/or where
the city deems necessary throughout the subdivision/development. All costs to
install streetlights and poles shall be borne by the developer. All ongoing
cost for maintenance and operation shall be borne by the city.
      12.   Service Connections: All service connections for sanitary sewer,
domestic water and natural gas installed to the property line before placing
base gravel for the street.
      13.   Irrigation Improvements: For any new subdivision or PUD, to be
provided with a public water system and containing more than four (4) lots, a
pressure irrigation system shall be provided. All irrigation structures, lines
and drain lines except street storm drain lines shall be located out of the
street right of way. Except as where provided for below, city water may not be
used for irrigation purposes.
         a.   The requirement for installation of a pressurized irrigation
system may be waived by the city council when the applicant has established
that any of the following situations exist (the sale or transfer of an existing
water right shall not be grounds for requesting a waiver pursuant to this
provision):
            (1)   Where a sufficient surface irrigation water right does not
exist for the property. The lack of surface irrigation water right shall be
documented in writing by the appropriate irrigation district or canal company
and the department of water resources and shall be submitted with the
subdivision preliminary plat. In this case a waiver shall only be granted for
that portion of the subdivision that cannot be served.
            (2)   Where an existing surface water right cannot be delivered to
the property by an irrigation district or canal company due to current delivery
capacity or scheduling. In these situations the city council may still require
the installation of the pressure irrigation system, provided water rights can
be made available to the property and delivery system modifications can be made
so irrigation water can be supplied within two (2) years.
            (3)   Where the applicant has provided for another means of
delivery such as flood irrigation, if approved by the city engineer. The
applicant shall present the proposed alternative delivery system to the city
engineer at the time the waiver is requested.
            (4)   That due to the specific circumstances surrounding a new
subdivision, the cost of obtaining water rights, reestablishing water rights or
developing the system would impose an undue economic hardship on the developer.
For purposes of this section an undue economic hardship shall consist of a
showing that the cost per lot to develop the pressurized irrigation system
would be twenty five percent (25%) higher than the cost per lot for providing a
pressurized irrigation system to subdivisions of similar size and density
constructed in the city within the previous two (2) years; or the cost per lot
of the pressurized irrigation system would exceed five percent (5%) of the
expected per lot market value of the subdivision.
The developer shall bear the burden of providing documentation, acceptable to
the city engineer and city council, demonstrating and supporting the estimated
costs of construction of the pressurized irrigation system, and the cost per
lot for irrigation systems in those subdivisions built in the last two (2)
years as noted above, and the expected market value of the subdivision lots.
For phased developments, costs will be analyzed over all phases of the
development rather than the first phase only.
         b.   Should installation of a pressurized irrigation system be waived
by the city engineer, as outlined herein, compliance to Idaho Code section 31-
3805 is still required.
         c.   Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the city with the
preliminary plat, small subdivision or development application and shall be
accompanied by an irrigation report, prepared by a licensed Idaho registered
professional engineer, stating the location and availability of surface
irrigation water and documenting the basis for the waiver request. If
applicable, the irrigation report shall be accompanied by a letter from the
irrigation district or canal company stating that water rights and/or a
delivery system are not available to the property.
      14.   Off Site Improvements: Off site improvements of any of the above
where it is deemed necessary to properly serve the proposed development or
protect the integrity of the usefulness of existing off site improvements or
utilities.
      15.   Required Features: Common areas, open spaces, greenbelt, irrigation
or drainage easements along waterways. When such features have been required as
conditions of approval, the designated areas shall be designed, landscaped,
planted to lawn or a suitable ground cover, and maintained throughout the
warranty period in a manner appropriate to the described use. Unless otherwise
described, at a minimum, this shall include irrigation, weed control, and
periodic mowing. When these areas abut a water feature, the design and
maintenance shall include all lands to the water's edge.
   B.   Inspections:
      1.   The owner and/or subdivider shall retain a full time licensed
professional engineer or licensed construction manager who shall supervise the
construction inspection, certify that all improvements were constructed in
accordance with the approved improvement drawings and city standards and
furnish the city two (2) sets of the as built improvement drawings and
construction logs complete with ties to all water valves and service
connections, along with a digital copy of said documents in a format usable by
the city. The city or city engineer will make observations at their discretion.
Such observations, if performed shall be paid for by developer.
      2.   The city shall be notified when construction begins on any of the
improvements listed and prior to performing utility line pressure tests. Any
improvements deemed unsatisfactory by the city engineer shall be corrected at
the subdivider's expense.
   C.   Amended Plats: Amended plats must be filed as per the original. In the
event a plat of a subdivision has been recorded and major changes have been
made which change the subdivision materially, an amended plat shall be filed in
accordance with the regulations established in this chapter. Any change in
street location shall require an amended plat for that portion that is
affected. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-4-3: WATER LINE EXTENSION CREDITS:
   A.   Definition: As used in this section, the following term shall have this
meaning:
   OFF SITE WATER FACILITY: Any water facility (including main lines, wells,
storage tanks, booster pump stations, pressure reducing valves, and related
facilities) which is located beyond the boundary of the development, and has
the capability of providing water service beyond the boundary of the
development. Water facilities located within existing roadways adjacent to the
new development boundary are not considered off site water extensions unless
they are requested by the city specifically to serve adjoining property.
Oversized facilities within the boundary of the development, excluding main
lines, may be considered off site if the city requires said facilities to have
excess capacity.
   B.   Methods Of Computing Credits:
      1.   Oversized Water Mains: Credits for oversized mains shall be based
upon the actual materials cost of the oversized main minus the materials cost
of an equivalent eight inch (8") diameter main. Reimbursement of the credits
shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      2.   On Site Stub Out: Credits for on site stub outs shall be based upon
the actual construction cost of the main line stub outs. Reimbursement of the
credits shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      3.   Off Site Water Facility: Credits for off site water facilities shall
be based on either subsection B3a or B3b of this section, as recommended by the
city engineer subject to approval by city council as part of the credit
agreement.
         a.   Credits for off site oversized facilities shall be based upon the
actual materials cost of the oversized facility minus the materials cost of an
equivalent facility to serve the new development. Reimbursement of the credits
shall be done in accordance with subsection C2 of this section.
         b.   Alternatively, credits for off site water facilities shall be
based upon the actual construction cost of the water facility prorated on a
percent of capacity utilized basis. A map shall be prepared which shows the
estimated eligible service area of the water facility which shall serve as the
basis for all calculations. The total credit due the developer shall be
calculated based upon the following equation:
 
                                    total service area (acres) - total
credit = actual construction cost  development area (acres)            
                                    total service area (acres)
 
For purposes of the credit calculation the total development area shall include
all area within the subdivision boundary including road right of way, open
area, common area, etc. Reimbursement of the credits shall be done in
accordance with subsection C3 of this section.
         c.   The capacity for off site water facilities shall be determined as
follows:
            (1)   The capacity of a water main extension shall be calculated by
the city engineer based on the total number of acres which can be serviced by
the main line. Total acreage which can be serviced by any off site main line
extension shall be based upon the actual total acreage of the proposed
development, plus the total acreage of land adjoining the water main located
within six hundred sixty feet (660') either side of the centerline of the main
line extension or as otherwise determined by the city engineer to define
property benefited.
            (2)   The baseline capacity for well construction or water supply
reimbursement shall be the water demands of the development at peak hour flow
plus the requisite fire flow.
            (3)   Additional capacity for such items as booster pump stations,
storage tanks, and pressure reducing valves shall be eligible for reimbursement
after the baseline water demands of the developer requesting reimbursement are
satisfied.
   C.   Credit Agreement: Upon final inspection and acceptance of the potable
water facility which is eligible for construction credits, a letter outlining
the total dollar amount of credits shall be issued to the developer by the city
engineer. The developer shall then execute a credit agreement with the city.
The credit agreement shall establish the payment terms:
      1.   On Site Oversizing And Stub Outs: For all on site oversizing or stub
outs, which are constructed at the request of the city, the amount of the
credit due to the developer will be paid from connection fees collected from
his development as they are collected at the time of building permit
application. All connection fees collected shall be placed in a separate
account. The developer shall then receive quarterly disbursement from the
dedicated credit account until the credit is satisfied.
      2.   Off Site Oversizing: For all off site oversizing, which is
constructed at the request of the city, the credit due to the developer will be
paid from connection fees collected from his development as they are collected.
All connection fees collected shall be placed in a separate account. The
developer shall then receive quarterly disbursement from the dedicated credit
account.
      3.   Off Site Water Facilities:
         a.   For all off site water facilities, which are constructed and paid
for by the developer, the city shall establish a "latecomer's fee" which shall
be charged to all property indicated by the service area boundary shown on the
service area map which receives benefit from the extension and did not
participate in financing the original construction. Seventy five percent (75%)
of the total service area shall be used for purposes of calculating the
latecomer's fee to account for potentially undevelopable property within said
service area. The fees collected shall be placed into a separate interest
bearing account. The developer shall then receive payments from this account on
a quarterly basis.
         b.   Payments shall be made for the principal plus interest until the
credit agreement is paid in full, or a period of ten (10) years, whichever is
sooner. The developer may request a five (5) year extension on the
reimbursement period within six (6) months of the period's expiration, and may
request a second five (5) year extension within six (6) months of the first
extension's expiration, for a total reimbursement period not to exceed twenty
(20) years, with each extension request subject to approval by city council.
Interest rate paid shall be established in the credit agreement. The city shall
charge a fee for administration of the "latecomer's" account which shall be
established in the credit agreement.
         c.   The latecomer's fee shall be calculated by the following
equation:
 
                             credit + administration fee
latecomer's fee ($/acre) =  (75%) (total service area – total development  
                             area)
 
      4.   Method Of Collecting Latecomer's Fees: All fees shall be based upon
gross development area and shall be collected by the city at the time of
preliminary plat application, final plat application, and/or building permit
application as directed by resolution of city council. Fees may be further
subdivided for collection purposes on an individual basis as follows:
         a.   For commercial and/or industrial developments the fees shall be
based upon the commercial lot area plus a percentage of any right of way and/or
common area as applicable.
         b.   For residential developments the fees shall be based upon a per
equivalent single-family dwelling basis based upon the total fee established on
the gross area of the subdivision divided by the number of equivalent single-
family dwellings. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-4-4: SEWER LINE EXTENSION CREDITS:
   A.   Definition: As used in this section, the following term shall have this
meaning:
   OFF SITE SEWER FACILITY: Any sewer facility (including main lines, manholes,
pump stations, force mains, and related facilities) which is located beyond the
boundary of the development, and has the capability of providing sewer service
beyond the boundary of the development. Sewer facilities located within
existing roadways adjacent to the new development boundary are not considered
off site sewer extensions unless they are requested by the city specifically to
serve adjoining property. Oversized facilities within the boundary of the
development, excluding main lines, may be considered off site if the city
requires said facilities to have excess capacity.
   B.   Methods Of Computing Credits:
      1.   Oversized Gravity Sewer Main: Credits for oversized mains shall be
based upon the actual materials cost of the oversized main minus the materials
cost of an equivalent eight inch (8") diameter main. Reimbursement of the
credits shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      2.   Oversized Force Main: Credits for oversized force mains shall be
based upon the actual materials cost of the oversized line minus the materials
cost of an equivalent length of four inch (4") diameter pipe. Reimbursement of
the credits shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      3.   Oversized Lift Station: Credits for oversized lift stations shall be
based upon the actual materials cost of the oversized lift station minus the
materials cost of lift station equipment sized to meet the peak flow demands of
the development. Reimbursement of the credits shall be done in accordance with
subsection C1 of this section.
      4.   On Site Stub Out: Credits for on site stub outs shall be based upon
the actual construction cost of the main line stub outs. Reimbursement of the
credits shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      5.   On Site Over Depth: Credits for on site over depth shall be based
upon the actual bid amount for over depth excavation. In order to be eligible
for over depth reimbursement the project must be bid with an item for trench
excavation on an incremental basis for depths below eight feet (8.0') as
applicable for the specific project. Reimbursement of the credits shall be done
in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
      6.   Off Site Sewer Facility: Credits for off site sewer facilities shall
be based on either subsection B6a or B6b of this section, as recommended by the
city engineer subject to approval by city council as part of the credit
agreement.
         a.   Credits for off site oversized facilities shall be based upon the
actual materials cost of the oversized facility minus the materials cost of an
equivalent facility to serve the new development. Reimbursement of the credits
shall be done in accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
         b.   Alternatively, credits for off site sewer facilities shall be
based upon the actual construction cost of the sewer facility prorated on a
percent of capacity utilized basis. The capacity of the sewer facility shall be
calculated by the city engineer based upon the total number of acres which may
be serviced by the facility. A map shall be prepared which shows the estimated
eligible service area of the sewer facility which shall serve as the basis for
all calculations. The total credit due the developer shall be calculated based
upon the following equation:
 
                                    total service area (acres) - total
credit = actual construction cost  development area (acres)            
                                    total service area (acres)
 
For purposes of the credit calculation the total development area shall include
all area within the subdivision boundary including road right of way, open
area, common area, etc. Reimbursement of the credits shall be done in
accordance with subsection C1 of this section.
   C.   Credit Agreement: Upon final inspection and acceptance of the sewerage
facility which is eligible for sewer construction credits, a letter outlining
the total dollar amount of credits shall be issued to the developer by the city
engineer. The developer shall then execute a credit agreement with the city.
The credit agreement shall establish the payment terms.
      1.   On Site Oversizing And Stub Outs: For all on site oversizing or stub
outs, which are constructed at the request of the city, the credit due to the
developer will be paid from connection fees collected from his development as
they are collected at the time of building permit application. All connection
fees collected shall be placed in a separate account up to the full amount due
to the developer. The developer shall receive a quarterly disbursement from the
dedicated credit account for up to the full amount of the credit due.
      2.   Off Site Oversizing: For all off site oversizing, which is
constructed at the request of the city, the credit due to the developer will be
paid from connection fees collected from his development as they are collected
at the time of building permit application. All connection fees collected shall
be placed in a separate account up to the full amount due to the developer. The
developer shall receive a quarterly disbursement from the dedicated credit
account for up to the full amount of the credit due.
      3.   Off Site Sewer Facilities:
         a.   For all off site sewer facilities, which are constructed and paid
for by the developer, the city shall establish a "latecomer's fee" which shall
be charged to all property indicated by the service area boundary shown on the
service area map which receives benefit from the extension and did not
participate in financing the original construction. Seventy five percent (75%)
of the total service area shall be used for purposes of calculating the
latecomer's fee to account for potentially undevelopable property within said
service area. The fees collected shall be placed into a separate interest
bearing account. The developer shall then receive payments from this account on
a quarterly basis.
         b.   Payments shall be made for the principal plus interest until the
credit agreement is paid in full, or a period of ten (10) years, whichever is
sooner. The developer may request a five (5) year extension on the
reimbursement period within six (6) months of the period's expiration, and may
request a second five (5) year extension within six (6) months of the first
extension's expiration, for a total reimbursement period not to exceed twenty
(20) years, with each extension request subject to approval by city council.
Interest rate paid shall be established in the credit agreement. The city shall
charge a fee for administration of the "latecomer's" account which shall be
established in the credit agreement.
         c.   The latecomer's fee shall be calculated by the following
equation:
 
                             credit + administration fee
latecomer's fee ($/acre) =  (75%) (total service area – total development  
                             area)
 
      4.   Method Of Collecting Latecomer's Fees: All fees shall be based upon
gross development area and shall be collected by the city at the time of
preliminary plat application, final plat application, and/or building permit
application as directed by resolution of city council. Fees may be further
subdivided for collection purposes on an individual basis as follows:
         a.   For commercial and/or industrial developments the fees shall be
based upon the commercial lot area plus a percentage of any right of way and/or
common area as applicable.
         b.   For residential developments the fees shall be based upon a per
equivalent single-family dwelling basis based upon the total fee established on
the gross area of the subdivision divided by the number of equivalent single-
family dwellings.
         c.   Fees will only be collected from benefited development. (Ord.

541, 2-26-2007)
6-5-3: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT; CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT:
6-5-3-1: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Purpose And Intent:
      1.   The planned unit development (PUD) process provides an opportunity
for land development that preserves natural features, allows efficient
provision of services, and provides common open spaces or other amenities not
found in traditional lot by lot development. The procedure may allow a
combination or variety of residential, commercial, office, technical and
industrial land uses. It also provides for the consistent application of
conditions of approval for the various phases of the planned unit development.
      2.   A planned unit development is intended to:
         a.   Permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative
design for development than generally is possible under conventional zoning
regulations;
         b.   Retain and preserve natural scenic qualities and topographic
features of open spaces; promote aesthetics; prevent disruption of natural
drainage patterns;
         c.   Promote the creation and efficient use of open space and park
area;
         d.   Provide a harmonious variety of neighborhood development and a
higher level of urban amenities.
   B.   Conditional Use Permit Required: Every planned unit development
requires a conditional use permit and shall be subject to all conditional use
permit application procedures as well as to procedures specified in this
chapter. When a PUD includes mixed land uses (zoning deviation) or is intended
to be subdivided for sale to separate ownerships upon completion, the
conditional use permitting procedure shall require two (2) public hearings, one
before the planning and zoning commission and one before the council.
   C.   Other Requirements: A PUD shall be subject to applicable development
requirements as set forth in
title 4, chapter 4 of this code; chapter 1 of this title; and sections
 6-5-4 and
6-5-6 of this chapter.
   D.   Ownership:
      1.   An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property
owner or a person having an existing interest in the property to be included in
the PUD. The PUD application shall be filed in the name or names of the
recorded owner or owners of property included in the development. However, the
application may be filed by the holder(s) of an equity interest in such
property.
      2.   Before approval is granted to the final development plan, the entire
project shall be under single or corporate ownership or control, and proof of
legal title must be presented with the final development plan.
   E.   Zoning Conformance: A PUD may be allowed by conditional use permit in
any zoning district when it is in substantial conformity with the underlying
zone and upon taking the following items into consideration:
      1.   The proposed uses shall not be detrimental to present and potential
surrounding uses; nor shall they be detrimental to the health, safety and
general welfare of the public. The suitability of the proposal will be
considered for the location and specific site.
      2.   The density of the planned unit development considered as a whole
shall be in substantial conformity with the density of the underlying zoning
district.
      3.   Any variation from the basic zoning district requirements must be
warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the preliminary and final
development plan.
      4.   The final development plan must be in conformance with the
preliminary plan.
      5.   The planned unit development must meet the general objectives of the
comprehensive land use plan.
      6.   Existing and proposed streets and utility services must be suitable
and adequate for the proposed development.
      7.   An agreement may be required between the developer and the city that
delineates commitments of the developer to the city and of the city to the
developer.
   F.   Use Regulations: Any permitted or conditional uses shown in section
5-2-2 of this code, allowed in an underlying zoning district may also be
allowed in the planned unit development.
   G.   Use Exceptions: In the case of planned unit developments greater than
two (2) acres in size, the commission may authorize specified uses not
permitted or conditionally permitted by the use regulations of the zoning
district in which the development is located, provided the commission shall
find:
      1.   That the uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development; and
      2.   That the uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature
or so located as to be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood; and
      3.   That the development is phased so that the approval to construct the
exceptioned use or uses is coordinated with the construction of all or a
proportionate phase of the permitted use; and
      4.   That no more than twenty percent (20%) of the total area of the
planned unit development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the
exception; and
      5.   That the uses permitted by such exception are shown to contribute to
a coherent living style and sense of community; and
      6.   That the use exceptions will be located and so designed as to
provide direct access to a collector or arterial street without creating
congestion or traffic hazards.
   H.   Developer Benefits: Planned unit developments are intended to provide
certain benefits to the public and to the developer. The installation of public
improvements (streets, water, sewer, streetlights, etc.) and two (2) or more of
the amenities set forth herein, ensure a public benefit. To provide the
developer with an incentive to utilize the planned unit development process,
the following allowances may be incorporated into the proposal:
      1.   A variety of housing types may be included in residential projects
including attached units, detached units, single-family units and multiple
units.
      2.   Private streets may be utilized within the project subject to the
same standards for public streets set forth in section
6-3-2 of this title, and subject to approval by the city council based on
recommendations from the city planner, city engineer, public works supervisor
and fire chief.
      3.   Setbacks for buildings within the interior of the project may be
less than required in the zoning district. A distance of ten feet (10') shall
be maintained between all detached buildings unless greater separation is
required by fire or building codes.
      4.   The conditions of approval applied to a large planned unit
development concept plan shall be applied consistently to each subsequent phase
unless otherwise agreed to by both the applicant and the council.
      5.   Buildings may be clustered to preserve as open space those areas
considered to be environmentally sensitive, such as river areas, floodways,
foothills, and wetlands. Clustering of dwelling units, commercial and
industrial uses, is encouraged as long as buffer yards, open space and
emergency access are adequately planned. Buffer yards shall be required to
separate different uses in order to eliminate or minimize potential
interference and nuisances on adjacent properties.
      6.   Uses which are not allowed within the zoning district may be allowed
as part of the planned development subject to the twenty percent (20%)
exception requirements.
   I.   Development Standards: The development proposal shall be preplanned in
its entirety and be characterized by a unified site design. Approval of a
planned unit development shall substantially conform to the zoning district in
which the development is located unless otherwise provided herein and based on
the following:
      1.   Residential Density: The number of dwelling units allowed in a
planned unit development shall be calculated by taking the gross area, less the
area set aside for nonresidential excepted uses, less open spaces, churches,
schools, and public roadways, and dividing by the minimum lot area per dwelling
unit required by the zone in which the site is located. An increase in the
computed allowable maximum density, not to exceed twenty five percent (25%),
may be permitted upon recommendation of the commission that the increased
density is justified in terms of the relationship to open area, service demand
and the total quality and character of the project.
      2.   Yards: Along the periphery of the planned unit development, yards
shall be provided as required by regulations of the district in which the
development is located, unless an exception is provided. Where development
already exists at the periphery, the yards shall be matched, where practical
(e.g., side yards should be provided adjacent to side yards, rear yards
adjacent to rear yards and front yards opposite front yards).
      3.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking shall comply with the parking
requirements of the underlying zone. No common parking or maneuvering areas
shall be allowed within twenty feet (20') of the boundary of the PUD. All
common parking or maneuvering areas shall be buffered from adjacent properties.
The buffer area must be landscaped, screened, or protected by natural features
with the objective of minimizing adverse impacts to surrounding properties. In
addition to the above requirements, where on street parking is prohibited, at
least one-half (1/2) additional parking space per dwelling unit shall be
provided either in approved parking bays along the street or in an off street
parking area.
      4.   Signs: Signs shall comply with the signage ordinance (
title 5, chapter 10 of this code).
      5.   Storm Water Management: The management of storm water shall conform
with the city storm water management policy (section
 6-3-9 of this title).
      6.   Open Space/Common Areas/Amenities: For purposes of this chapter, the
following shall apply:
Unless otherwise approved, not less than ten percent (10%) of the total gross
area of a residential PUD shall be retained as permanent open space and shall
not include strips of less than fifteen feet (15') in width unless designed to
accommodate a water feature such as a pond or stream. A minimum of twenty
percent (20%) of land area of a PUD devoted to multiple-family residential use
shall consist of open space. Of this required open space, portions may be
"common area" used for recreational or other collective enjoyment by occupants
of the development, privately owned properties dedicated by easements to assure
that open space will be permanent, and lands developed as active recreational
areas or preserved in their natural state when such areas contain unique
natural assets such as groves of trees, ponds, rivers or streambeds. If ponds
are considered as part of the required open space, no more than fifty percent
(50%) of the open space shall be comprised of the ponds.
         a.   Dimension: In order to be functionally usable, open space should
exist in quantities of some minimum dimension. Therefore, the areas of each
parcel of open space to be used for active recreational use shall have a size
and shape consistent with the planned use.
         b.   Location: Open spaces shall be distributed within projects in
locations near the dwelling units of the people they are intended to serve.
         c.   Open Space: Land indicated as open space, common areas, amenities
(tennis courts, playgrounds, swimming pool, etc.), streets and sidewalks shall
be shown on the preliminary plan and provide on the plan that they be
permanently maintained as such either by a homeowners' association which
provides private covenants, an agreement with the developer or, if suitable and
mutually agreeable, by public dedications.
      7.   Easements: Easements for pedestrian/bicycle pathways in accordance
with the city's greenbelt/bike/pathway master plan.
      8.   Amenities: Amenities shall be provided as a part of each planned
unit development greater than one acre in size. The number of amenities
(minimum of 2) shall be proportionate to the size of the development and may
include, but not be limited to, any of the following:
         a.   Private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool, tennis
court, barbecue area or playground of a size appropriate to meet needs of the
development.
         b.   Provision for public access to any public open space, park or
river greenbelt.
         c.   Publicly dedicated land in a PUD for facilities such as school,
fire station, well site, public park, public recreational facility.
         d.   Additional open space for parkways, boulevards, or other features
designed to mitigate vehicle/traffic impact.
         e.   Other amenities as approved by the planning and zoning commission
and council.
      9.   Landscaped Open Space: All residential planned unit developments on
less than one acre shall provide each dwelling unit with a minimum of one
hundred (100) square feet of private, landscaped open space. The planning and
zoning commission should evaluate each project on its own merits and allow
variations to the open space standard where it can be shown that the provided
space meets the intent and purpose of this section.
      10.   Required Setbacks: Attached structures may be permitted in planned
unit developments. The minimum separation between detached buildings shall be
ten feet (10') unless greater separation is required by fire or building codes.
      11.   Industrial Uses: Industrial and technological uses shall be
developed in park like surroundings including landscape as buffers to screen
lighting and parking areas.
      12.   Private Streets: Private streets may be utilized within the project
subject to the same standards for public streets set forth in section
6-3-2 of this title when the following requirements are met:
         a.   The planning and zoning commission, after recommendation of the
fire chief, county sheriff, public works supervisor and city engineer, finds
that the design of the proposed streets, pedestrianways and off street parking
is adequate to protect public health, safety and welfare and shall adequately
accommodate anticipated uses within the development.
         b.   Private streets shall be owned by a homeowners' association, and
all future repair and maintenance costs, including reconstruction, shall be
borne by the homeowners.
   J.   Application Procedure:
      1.   Preapplication: Prior to the filing of an application for approval
of a planned unit development, the developer shall submit to the city a
conceptual plan of the development proposal to enable review and comment. Such
plan may be generalized in content and such submission shall not require the
official filing of an application and fee. The conceptual plan shall include

considering that new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures within the floodplain shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to one foot (1') or higher or above the level of the 100-
year flood; and, for new construction or substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures, the lowest floor (including basement) shall be
elevated to one foot (1') or higher or above the level of the 100-year flood
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be
floodproofed up to the level of the 100-year flood.

heights or velocities caused by subdivision fill, roads and intended uses.
         b.   The danger that intended uses may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The adequacy of proposed water supply and sanitation systems and
the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions under flood conditions.
         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damages and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         f.   The requirements of the subdivision for a waterfront location.
         g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed subdivision and land uses.
         h.   The compatibility of the proposed uses with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         i.   The relationship of the proposed subdivision to the comprehensive
plan and any floodplain management program for the area.
         j.   The safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles in
times of flood.
         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.
         l.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      2.   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If only
part of a proposed subdivision can be safely developed, development shall be
limited to that part and the council shall require development to proceed
consistent with the determination.
   D.   Floodproofing Plans: Floodproofing plans must be individually approved
by the city upon recommendation from the commission before such uses are
constructed. Floodproofing may include, but not be limited to, the following:
      1.   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
      2.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters or similar
methods of closure.
      3.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure.
      4.   Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls.
      5.   Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation.

drainage systems to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood
pressures.
      9.   Building design and construction to resist rupture or collapse
caused by water pressure or floating debris.
      10.   Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains
which permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and storm
waters into buildings or structures.
      11.   Location and installation of all electrical equipment, circuits and
electrical appliances so that they are protected from inundation by the
regulatory flood.
      12.   Location of storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant
materials, flammable liquids or other toxic materials which could be hazardous
to public health, safety and welfare at elevations above the height associated
with the regulatory protection elevation; or design of such facilities to
prevent flotation of storage containers, or damage to storage containers which
could result in the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters. (Ord. 541, 2-
26-2007)
6-5-5: SUBDIVISION FOR CEMETERY:

6-6-2: Action On Request
6-6-1: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   Required: Any property owner desiring to have an existing subdivision,
public right of way or easement vacated, or desiring to dedicate a street right
of way or easement, shall complete and file an application with the
administrator and also file such other applications as are otherwise required
by law. These provisions shall not apply to any street right of way or easement
to be shown on a recorded plat of a subdivision.
   B.   Placed On Planning Commission Agenda: Upon receipt of the completed
application and other information as may be required, the administrator shall
affix the date of application acceptance thereon. Said application shall then
be placed on the agenda for consideration at the next regular meeting of the
planning commission. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-6-2: ACTION ON REQUEST:
   A.   Planning Commission Recommendations: The commission shall review the
request and any agency response and make a recommendation to the city for
approval, conditional approval or denial.
   B.   City Action:
      1.   When considering an application for vacation procedures, the city
shall establish a date for public hearing and give such public notice as
required by law. The city may approve or deny the application. Whenever public
rights of way or lands are vacated, the city shall provide adjacent property
owners with appropriate assurances in the form of a quitclaim deed or other
documents for said vacated rights of way in such proportions as are prescribed
by law.
      2.   When considering an application for dedication, the city may approve
or deny the application. When a dedication is approved, any required street

CHAPTER 7
CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
SECTION:
6-7-1: Waivers
6-7-2: Amendments
6-7-1: WAIVERS:
   A.   Justification: Where the planning commission finds that compliance with
this title would cause unusual hardship because of exceptional and unique
conditions of topography, access, location, shape, size, drainage or other
physical features of the site, the minimum requirements of this title may be
modified to mitigate the hardship, provided that the development is in keeping
with the purposes of this title. No such modifications may be granted if it
would have the effect of nullifying the purpose of the zoning regulations of
the city, the comprehensive plan or this title.
   B.   Economic Gain Alone Not Sufficient: The fact that an owner could
realize a greater financial return from his property by subdividing said
property contrary to these regulations is not a sufficient reason for hardship.
Hardship cannot be proved where it can be shown that property was purchased
with the knowledge of existing restrictions, nor can hardship be claimed in
terms of prospective sales or potential customers. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)
6-7-2: AMENDMENTS:
The council may, from time to time, amend, supplement or repeal the regulations
and provisions of this title in the following manner:
   A.   Planning Commission Hearing: The planning commission, prior to
recommending an amendment, supplement or repeal of this title, shall conduct at
least one public hearing in which interested persons shall have an opportunity
to be heard. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, notice of the
time and place and a summary of the proposed amendment, supplement or repeal to
be discussed shall be published in the official newspaper or paper of general
circulation within the jurisdiction. The commission shall also make available a
notice to other papers, radio and television stations serving the jurisdiction
for use as a public service announcement. Following the commission hearing, if
the commission makes a material change in the regulations of this title, other
than that published for the present hearing, further notice and hearings shall
be provided before the commission forwards its recommendation to the council. A
record of the hearings, findings made and actions taken shall be maintained.
   B.   Council Hearing: The council, prior to adoption of an amendment,
supplement or repeal of this title, shall hold at least one public hearing
using the same notice and hearing procedures as the commission. The council
shall not hold a public hearing, give notice of a proposed hearing or take
action on a proposed amendment until recommendations have been received from
the commission. Following the hearing of the council, if the council makes a
material change in this title, other than that published for the present
hearing, further notice and hearings shall be provided before the council
adopts the amendment, supplement or repeal. (Ord. 541, 2-26-2007)

of users of the Parma municipal airport and property or occupants of land in
its vicinity; an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach
minimums of the Parma municipal airport; and an obstruction may reduce the size
of areas available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus
tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Parma municipal airport and the
public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared:
      1.   That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Parma municipal airport;
      2.   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public
safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions
that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
      3.   That the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to
the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power, without
compensation.
   B.   The prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air
navigation; the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to
air navigation; or the marking and lighting of obstructions, are public
purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds
and acquire land or interests in land. (Ord. 552, 3-9-2009)
7-2-17: AIRPORT ZONES:
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical
surfaces as they apply to the Parma municipal airport. Such zones are shown on
the Parma city zoning map. An area located in more than one of the following
zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height
limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty
feet (250') wide. The approach expands outward symmetrically to a width of one
thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   B.   Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two
hundred fifty feet (250') wide. This approach zone expands outward
symmetrically to a width of two thousand feet (2,000') at a horizontal distance
of five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   C.   Transitional Zone: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   D.   Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of
five thousand feet (5,000') radii from the centerline of each end of the
primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing
lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach
and transitional zones.
   E.   Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). (Ord. 552, 3-9-2009)
7-2-18: AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. The following height limitations apply to the
zones:
   A.   Utility runway visual approach zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending a horizontal distance of five thousand feet
(5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
   B.   Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone: Slopes twenty
feet (20') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
   C.   Transitional zones: Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation which is two thousand three hundred seventy
eight feet (2,378') above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there
are established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet (10,000')
measured at ninety degree (90°) angles to the extended runway centerline.
   D.   Horizontal zone: Established at one hundred fifty feet (150') above the
airport elevation or at a height of two thousand three hundred seventy eight
feet (2,378') above mean sea level.
   E.   Conical zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty feet (350') above the airport elevation, or two thousand five hundred

structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created, unless a conditional use permit therefor
shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for
a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless
a variance has been approved.
      1.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      2.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet (4,200')
from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
      3.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour,
or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as approved by conditional use permit.
   B.   Variance: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the city for a
variance from such regulations. The city shall render findings and conclusions
regarding the following, in addition to other criteria stated in this code. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
aviation administration having jurisdiction as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace. Such variances shall be approved where it is found that: 1)
a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship, and 2) relief granted: will not be contrary to the public
interest; will not create a hazard to air navigation; will do substantial
justice; and will be harmonious with the purposes described in this chapter.
   C.   Obstruction Marking And Lighting: An owner of a structure or tree in an
airport zone shall, at the owner's sole expense, install, operate and maintain
necessary markings and lights. (Ord. 552, 3-9-2009)

similar objectionable or toxic substances or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement to such a degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the City for such materials.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-
producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the City as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage,
to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies of
jurisdiction of such discharge to the receiving waters
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes as may exceed limits established
by the City in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
      8.   Any water or wastes having a pH of 9.5 or less than 6.0.
      9.   Materials which exert or cause:
         a.   Unusual concentrations of inert or suspended solids such as, but
not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues, or of
dissolved solids such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate.
         b.   Excessive discoloration such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions.

treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   D.   City Options: If any water or wastes are discharged or are proposed to
be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in this Section and which, in the
judgment of the City, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the City may:
      1.   Reject the wastes,
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers,
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of

in the billing policy, as adopted by resolution approved by the city council.
Any account not paid by the due date shall become delinquent and bear interest
at the maximum rate permitted by law, commencing on the due date. If the user
feels there is a discrepancy in the bill, the user may appeal to the city clerk
for an adjustment up to the due date. If the city clerk determines that an
error was made in calculation of the bill or because of faulty equipment, she
is authorized to make the necessary adjustments to the account.
   B.   Delinquency And Notice: All bills for water use fees not paid by the
past due date shall authorize the city, in addition to its rights and remedies
set forth in this chapter, to discontinue the water service to any such
defaulting customer, unless the user submits a written request to enter into a
short term payment agreement to the city clerk as provided in this section.
Notice of such delinquency and a disconnect date shall be included with the
monthly billing statement.
      1.   Short Term Payment Agreements: A water user may request to enter
into a short term payment agreement to extend the time for payment of all water
service charges and fees due prior to disconnection. Short term payment
agreements may not extend beyond sixty (60) days from the date the agreement is
executed. All fees due and owing at the end of the sixty (60) day period,
including charges for water and sewer service, disconnection fees and
reconnection fees, if any, must be paid in full or the service will be
disconnected without further notice and the consumer will be required to pay
all connection charges in effect at the time of reconnection. Only one short
term payment agreement may be authorized for each account per year, unless
additional agreements are approved by the mayor and city clerk.
      2.   Disconnection Fees: All delinquent accounts will be assessed a late
fee and a disconnection/turn on charge in an amount established by resolution
approved by the city council.
      3.   Pretermination Hearing: A user may request a pretermination hearing
by submitting a written request prior to the due date. Pretermination hearings
shall be heard by the city council, which shall render its decision in writing,
giving the reasons for its determination. If an adverse decision is rendered
against the user as a result of the pretermination hearing, the city may
require the user to pay the delinquent water bill attributable to his own use,
plus any applicable disconnection fees, turn on charges, interest and other
fees as established by resolution approved by the city council.
   C.   Collection: The city clerk is hereby authorized to collect delinquent
payments by any legal method as approved by the city attorney. At such time as
any delinquency shall become inactive for a period of time exceeding six (6)
months, or in the case of bankruptcy proceedings, said debt may be deemed
uncollectible. The city clerk may prepare a request for write off of the
account for the city council’s consideration. Writing off a delinquent account
shall not act as a forgiveness of the underlying obligation. In addition to any
other remedies provided by federal, state or local law, in the event a water
user fails to pay a water bill and allows the bill to become delinquent, the
city shall have the following remedies:
      1.   The city may turn the account over to a collection agency for
collection;
      2.   The city may attach the unpaid obligation to a different water or
sewer account in the user’s name, whether the account is in existence or
subsequently created, and continue to bill the original account; or
      3.   Refuse to offer new water or sewer services to the user until the
account is paid in full.
   D.   Liability Of Owner: In the event that a property is vacant, the owner
of such premises, as the authorized water user, shall be liable to the city for
the payment of any charges incurred, including the monthly base rate. This
includes all charges incurred between the time a tenant vacates the premises
and the premises is reoccupied by a new tenant.
   E.   Lien Imposed: Where allowed by law, all delinquent charges or fees, as
provided by this chapter, not paid after the final determination of the
delinquent account, shall be imposed as a lien against and upon the property
against which such charge or fee is levied or assessed; and the city clerk
shall, at the time of certifying the city taxes, certify such delinquencies
together with all penalties to the tax collector of Canyon County, and when so
certified, the same shall be a lien upon the property. All monies collected by
the city clerk under the provisions of this section shall be paid over to the
city treasurer in the same manner as is required for the payment of other city
monies. If a lien has been filed against the property, and service has been
shut off for any reason, the water service shall not be turned back on until
all liens and past due amounts are paid, including the minimum monthly charges
as established by resolution approved by the city council. (Ord. 574, 3-9-2015;

applicable and set by resolution of the city council.
   B.   Ownership, Replacement And Repairs: All water service connections,
meters and housings installed by the city or conveyed to the city, however
provided for, shall remain at all times the property of the city and shall be
maintained, repaired and renewed by the public works supervisor when rendered
unserviceable through reasonable use. Where replacement, repairs or adjustments
are rendered necessary by the act, negligence or carelessness of the water
user, any member of the user's family, person in the user's employ, or agent of
the user, any expense caused to the city thereby shall be charged and collected
from the user. The city will pay no rent or charge where such facilities are
located on the user's premises. The city may relocate its facilities as
required by operating conditions, and may relocate any and all of its
facilities from user's premises at the termination of service.
   C.   Adjustments Of Bills For Meter Error: In the event the city determines
that a water meter is failing to register correctly the water used, the

subdivision plat. As a condition of annexation into the city and/or as a
condition of approval of new development within the city, the landowner and/or
developer shall:
      1.   Secure suitable surface water rights adequate to satisfy all
irrigation, aesthetic, amenity, or recreation needs of the proposed development
and/or property proposed to be annexed. Transferred water rights must be valid,
existing water rights recognized by the Idaho department of water resources
(the "department"). The water rights shall be used on the property for the life
of the development and the city may require a development agreement, special or
conditional use conditions, subdivision approval conditions, restrictive
covenants, plat notations and/or a transfer of water rights to assure
compliance with this section. If any transfer, amendment or other proceedings
are required under Idaho Code or department rule or regulation for the city's
use of such water, the owner and/or developer shall be solely responsible for
the city's costs of completing the same and the city's costs of obtaining all
necessary approvals from the department as a condition of annexation and/or
development, including costs associated with mitigation. The requirement to
transfer and assign water rights shall not apply if water rights appurtenant to
the subject property are held by an irrigation district, canal company, ditch
users' association, or other irrigation delivery entity.
      2.   Secure suitable groundwater supplies and rights adequate to satisfy
all domestic water needs of the proposed development and/or property proposed
to be annexed. If the land to be developed or annexed receives or will receive
water from the city's municipal water supply system the landowner and/or

7-5A-1: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this article is:
      1.   To protect the public water supply of the city by isolating the
customer's water service from the city water system, thus preventing
contamination or pollution, which could backflow from the customer's premises
to the city water system;
      2.   To eliminate both potential and existing cross connections between
the potable water system and nonpotable water systems within the customer's
premises; and
      3.   To maintain the backflow prevention program by administering an
inspection and testing program of the customer premises and backflow prevention
assemblies installed at the location specified by the public works supervisor.
   B.   Policy: The city has a responsibility to protect the public water
system from contamination caused by the backflow of contaminants through a
water service connection. If, in the judgment of the public works supervisor,
an approved backflow prevention assembly is required to prevent contamination,
the city shall give notice to the customer to install the approved assembly or
assemblies at the service connection to the premises, or at an alternate
location deemed acceptable by the public works supervisor. The customer shall
immediately install the approved assembly or assemblies at the customer's own
expense. Failure, refusal or inability of the customer to install the approved
assembly or assemblies shall constitute grounds for disconnecting water service
to the premises until the backflow assembly or assemblies have been installed.
(Ord. 574, 3-9-2015)
7-5A-2: DEFINITIONS:
Whenever used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
following words and terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them:
   BACKFLOW: The flow of nonpotable water, liquids, gases or other foreign
substances into the pipes of a potable water system from any source or sources.

animals, the animal control officer or law enforcement officer may seize and
impound the animal pending the aforesaid hearings. The owner of the animal
shall be liable to the animal control director for the costs and expenses of
impoundment of such animal.
