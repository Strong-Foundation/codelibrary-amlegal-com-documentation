application of plans and ordinances for the area of city impact. (Ord. 373 § 1,
1980)
2.24.020: CONSIDERATIONS:
Trade area, geographic factors and areas that can reasonably be expected to be
annexed to the city in the future, were considered by the planning and zoning
commission, and the commission's recommendations relative to the area of city
impact were made known to the city. In establishing the area of city impact,
the city considered the same factors and the recommendations as provided by the
commission. (Ord. 373 § 2, 1980)

The officially adopted geographic area of city impact is shown on the map
entitled "area of city impact for Kimberly, Idaho", which map is attached to
the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the office of the city
clerk and incorporated in this chapter as if the same were set out in full.

by the city shall apply to the area of city impact within the unincorporated
area of the county. (Ord. 373 § 4, 1980)

serve one consecutive three (3) year term. The additional members appointed by
the county commissioners shall be owner-residents within the area of impact,

the area of impact.
   B.   Any person directly aggrieved and affected by a vote of the
administrative agency in which the two (2) commission appointees shall
participate may appeal to a board of appeals consisting of four (4) persons.
Two (2) of the persons shall be regularly appointed or elected members of the
city council and appointed by said council; and two (2) members shall be duly
elected or appointed county commissioners and appointed by the commission. The
appeals board shall be reappointed annually.

terms and conditions and pursuant to such notice to affected persons as they
deem appropriate. Upon hearing the matter, the appeals board shall reduce its
decision in writing and provide a copy of said decision to the aggrieved
person. The decision of the board of appeals shall be final and shall
constitute and be considered an exhaustion of the aggrieved person's
administrative remedies.
   D.   No official action or decision of the appeals board may be made unless
all four (4) voting members of the board are present and voting. All decisions
of the appeals board shall be determined by a majority vote of the board and

any transaction pursuant to this section, a purchaser must mail or deliver a
signed and dated copy of the cancellation notice to the seller at the seller's
place of business, not later than twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight of the third
business day following the consummation of the sale. "Business days" are

5.17.010: PURPOSE:
In the development and adoption of this chapter, it is recognized that there
are some adult business uses which, due to their very nature, have serious,
objectionable, operational characteristics, particularly when located in close
proximity to residential neighborhoods, thereby having a deleterious impact
upon property values and the quality of life in such surrounding areas. It has
been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local
governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of
such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure that these adverse secondary
effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of adjacent
neighborhoods nor endanger the well being of the youth in their communities.
The special regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable
externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth below. The primary
purpose of these controls and regulations is to preserve the integrity and
character of residential neighborhoods, to deter the spread of urban blight and
to protect minors from the objectionable, operational characteristics of these
adult uses by restricting their close proximity to churches, parks, schools,
restaurants, movie theaters and residential areas.
This chapter is not intended and should not be construed to create a
contemporary community standard nor to allow the sale, loan, distribution,
dissemination, presentation or exhibition of material or live conduct which is
obscene or which is in violation of any other law, nor to permit the creation
or maintenance of any moral nuisance. (Ord. 541 § 5, 2007)

      1.   When accompanied by a parent or guardian of said juvenile.
      2.   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of said minor.
      3.   When exercising first amendment rights protected by the United
States constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech,
and the right of assembly. The juvenile shall evidence the bona fides of such
exercise by first delivering to the person designated by the Twin Falls County
sheriff to receive such information, at the county building on Shoshone Street

juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile with

article is otherwise applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a first

hours of employment.

includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have
concerning the activities, conduct or whereabouts of a juvenile in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities. (Ord. 483 § 1,
1998)

and telephone number and how to contact his or her parent or guardian.
   B.   Determining Age Of Juvenile: In determining the age of the juvenile,
and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a
sheriff's officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his/her best
judgment in determining age.
   C.   Questioning Of Juvenile; Parents: The normal procedure shall then be to
take the juvenile to the Twin Falls County courthouse where a parent or
guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile. The juvenile
and/or parents or guardian shall then be questioned. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for
accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording,
thus making available experienced personnel and access to information and
records.
   D.   Release Into Custody Of Parent Or Guardian: When a parent or guardian,
immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the
appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to
the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take
charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall temporarily be entrusted to an
adult relative, neighbor, or other person who will on behalf of a parent or
guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the
availability or arrival of a parent or guardian.
   E.   Written Acknowledgement Of Status Offense: Upon release of the juvenile
to his/her parent, the juvenile and parent shall sign a written acknowledgment
of the county's curfew, runaway, incorrigible, and truancy regulations, which
notice shall be presumptive evidence of knowledge of this article.
   F.   Status Offenders: Status offenders shall not be placed in any jail
facility, but instead may be placed in juvenile shelter care facilities, except
in the case of runaways, when there is specific detention request from a
foreign jurisdiction to hold the child pending transportation agreements. (Ord.
483 § 1, 1998)
9.08.028: PENALTIES; TREATMENT:

shall be guilty of a status offense punishable by the provision according to
state code of the juvenile corrections act of 1994.

violate any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
may be punished by jail time of up to six (6) months, and a fine allowed by
state statute. Said parent or guardian may also be required to attend class
instructions on parenting provided through Twin Falls County juvenile probation
office. The purpose of the instruction is to provide the parents with more
ideas and support in raising their children.
   C.   Misdemeanor: Upon a first offense of any of the provisions of this
article by the juvenile or parent, the prosecuting attorney may request a
preliminary inquiry from the department of juvenile probation for screening and
assessment according to the department of juvenile probation's designated and
authorized procedures.
   D.   Repeat Offender: Any child who has been adjudicated for commission of
two (2) status offenses within twelve (12) months may be charged, petitioned,

13.04.260: CROSS CONNECTIONS UNLAWFUL:
   A.   No water service connection to a premise shall be installed or
continued in use unless the water supply is protected by backflow prevention
devices as may be required by this section and Title 1, Chapter 8, of Idaho
Regulations for Public Drinking Water Systems. The installation and maintenance
of a cross-connection which will endanger the water quality of the potable
water supply of the city shall be unlawful and is prohibited. Any such cross-
connection now existing or hereafter installed in violation of this section is
declared to be a public nuisance and the same shall be abated.
   B.   The control or elimination of cross-connections shall be in accordance
with this section and Title 1, Chapter 8 of Idaho Regulations for Public
Drinking Water Systems, together with the latest additions of appropriate
manuals of standard practice pertaining to cross-connection control approved by
the maintenance supervisor. The maintenance supervisor shall have the authority
to require standards more stringent than state regulations if he deems that the
conditions so dictate. The purveyor may adopt by resolution additional rules
and regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of this ordinance.
   C.   No connection will be made to a fire hydrant in the municipal water
system by a person without having received a permit for installation of an
approved backflow prevention device or adequate air gap approved by the
maintenance supervisor as provided in this ordinance, except for fire-fighting
purposes.
   D.   No person shall make or permit the cross-connection of a private water
system to a water line that is served by the municipal water system except as
provided in this ordinance. Whenever an owner connects to the municipal water
system he shall, at his expense, physically disconnect the private water source
from the municipal water source in such a manner that water from a private
water source will never pass through the same pipes that carry water from the
municipal source, except as may be approved by the maintenance supervisor and
health officer. (Ord. 595, 2012; Ord. 661, 2020)
13.04.270: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   Required: Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service
connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the maintenance
supervisor, the nature and extent of activities, or the materials stored on the
premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health and/or be
deleterious to the quality of the water should a cross-connection occur, even
though such cross-connection does not exist at the time the backflow prevention
devices shall be installed under circumstances, including but not limited to,
the following:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with Title 1, Section 8 of Idaho Regulations
for Public Drinking Water Systems, and is acceptable to the maintenance
supervisor;
      2.   Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross connections exist;
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist;
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being
established or re-established;
      5.   Premises on which a substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the municipal water system or where a cross-connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters;
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard
might result;
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the
municipal water system. A backflow prevention device shall be installed at
these facilities unless the maintenance supervisor and health officer determine
that no hazard exists:
         Chemical plants using a water process.
         Food or beverage processing plants.
         Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics.
         Laboratories.
         Metal plating industries.
         Petroleum processing or storage plants.
         Radioactive material processing plants or nuclear reactors.
         Wastewater treatment plants.
         Others as specified by the health officer.
   8.   Other premises where backflow prevention devices are reasonably
required to protect the municipal water system.
      9.   Under circumstances set forth in this section, the maintenance
supervisor shall have the right to require a reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device or a property air gap separation to be installed at
the property line, and to require of the property owner a signed legal letter
of release to the city and the maintenance supervisor for any responsibility of
the quality of water on the property.
   B.   Type dependent on degree of hazard. The type of protective device
required shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists:
      1.   An air gap separation and/or a reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the municipal water system may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard.
      2.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not
hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air gap separation, or
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed.
      3.   Where lawn sprinkling systems are installed a pressure vacuum
breaker, double check valve assembly, reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device, or an air gap separation shall be installed where there are
valves downstream of such device.
      4.   An atmospheric vacuum breaker may only be used where there are no
valves or shutoffs of any kind downstream of the device.
      5.   The degrees of hazard for specific installations may be determined
by referencing AWWA Pacific Northwest Section Cross Connection Control Manual,
the Uniform Plumbing Code, the AWWA Recommended Practice for Backflow
Prevention and Cross Connection Control (M14), the USC Foundation Manual of
Cross Connection Control, and other cross connection control references deemed
acceptable to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.
   C.   Approval required. Any Protective devices required by this section
shall be a model approved by the maintenance supervisor. Backflow prevention
devices will be approved if they have successfully passed the performance tests
of the University of Southern California Engineering Center, or other technical
centers approved by the purveyor. These devices shall be furnished and
installed by and at the expense of the customer. Installation shall be
according to the minimum standards and requirements of the American Water Works
Association (AWWA) Standard C-510 or C-511; Idaho Standards for Public Works
Construction (ISPWC); Uniform Plumbing Code; University of Southern California
Engineering Center; American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM); American
Association of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE); and the International Association of
Plumbing & Mechanical Officials (IAPMO).
   D.   Installation Location.
      1.   Backflow prevention devices required by this section shall be
installed at the meter, at the property line of the premises, or at a location
designated by the maintenance supervisor. The device shall be located so as to
be readily accessible for maintenance and testing.
      2.   Installation of a backflow device: Permit required. Backflow
prevention devices required by this ordinance shall be installed under a permit
issued by the supervision of and with the approval of the maintenance
supervisor.
   E.   Testable Assembly/Device Inspections:
      1.   Backflow prevention devices installed pursuant to this section shall
be inspected, tested and deemed fully operable upon installation, then
annually, or more often if necessary, in accordance with IDAPA Section
58.01.08.552.06.c. Inspections, tests, and maintenance shall be at the
customer's expense. Whenever the devices are found to be defective, they shall
be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the customer's expense, according to
the minimum standards set forth in Section C above.
      2.   Charges for permits, inspections, tests, and maintenance as required
by this section are to be established by resolution of the city council.
Inspections, tests, repairs, and records thereof shall be accomplished under
the maintenance supervisor's supervision by certified testers.
   F.   Underground Sprinklers: Backflow device required. No underground
sprinkling device interconnected with the city's potable water supply system
shall be installed without adequate backflow prevention devices at the point
from which the water for irrigation is taken from the municipal water system,
or at a location designated by the maintenance supervisor.
   G.   Failure to cooperate: Termination of water service. Failure of the
customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, testing, or inspection
of backflow prevention devices required by this section and Title I, Section 8,
of Idaho Regulations for Public Drinking Water Systems shall be grounds for the
termination of water service to the premises, or in the alternative, the
installation of an air gap separation at the customer's expense. (Ord. 595,
2012; Ord. 661, 2020)
13.04.280: PREREQUISITES FOR WATER DELIVERY; CROSS CONNECTION INSPECTIONS:
   A.   No water shall be delivered to a new structure of six thousand or more
square feet in area until the maintenance supervisor has received and approved
the mechanical plans and a list of plumbing materials to be used, and a permit
for installation has been issued, nor to any building of lesser size without a
visual inspection by the maintenance supervisor prior to sheetrock and
insulation installation, but after all preliminary plumbing has been done. This
is required for preliminary cross-connection inspection approval.
   B.   Construction for industrial or other purposes which is classified as
hazardous facilities pursuant to Section
13.04.270 of this ordinance, where it is reasonable to anticipate intermittent
cross-connections, as determined by the maintenance supervisor, shall be
protected by the installation of one or more approved backflow prevention
devices at the point of service from the municipal water system or another
location designated by the maintenance supervisor.
   C.   Inspections shall be made periodically of all buildings, structures, or
improvements of any nature now receiving water through the municipal water
system, for the purpose of ascertaining whether cross-connections exist. Such
inspections shall be made by the maintenance supervisor. (Ord. 595, 2012; Ord.
661, 2020)
13.04.290: CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL DEVICES:
   A.   Installation permits. If cross-connection control devices are found to
be necessary, the owner of the property served shall apply to the purveyor for
a specific installation permit prior to installation thereof. If additions are
made to the private service line such as underground sprinkling systems, or
other additions, the owner of the property shall apply to the purveyor for a
specific installation permit prior to installation thereof.
   B.   Cessation of water service. In the event an improper cross-connection
is not corrected or a failed device is not replaced with a fully operable
backflow device within ten (10) days or sooner as deemed necessary by the
Public Works Director or, in the event the purveyor is refused access to the
property for the purpose of determining whether or not cross-connections exist,
or if a cross connection control device is not installed on the premises
delivery of water to the property shall cease until the deficiency is corrected
to the maintenance supervisor's satisfaction. In addition, the purveyor may
affect the necessary repairs or modifications at the expense of the property
owner and refuse delivery of water to the property until the costs thereof
shall have been paid. (Ord. 595, 2012; Ord. 661, 2020)
13.04.300: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
   A.   A person who violates, omits, disobeys, neglects, or refuses to comply
with any provisions of this ordinance or related rules and regulation with
regard to cross connections adopted by the purveyor, shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall, for each offense, be
punished by a fine in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding thirty days, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Each day on which any such violation shall continue shall be
deemed a separate offense.
   B.   In addition to the penalty provided for subsection A of this section,
any a person violating a provision of this ordinance shall become liable to the
city for resulting expenses, loss, damage, repair, replacement, cleanup, and or
remediation cost incurred by the city by reason of such violation. (Ord. 595,

(Ord. 309 Art. 9, § 1, 1975)
13.08.370: BASIS FOR DETERMINATION:
   A.   The sewer user rate shall be based on the equivalent sewer schedule,
"one equivalent user" defined as contributing two hundred fifty (250) gallons
per day, 0.42 pound of five (5) day BOD per day and 0.50 pound of suspended
solids per day to the sewer system. The user equivalent schedule is as follows:
   USER EQUIVALENT SCHEDULE
 
Churches                     1 equivalent user
Mobile home or trailer house 1 equivalent user per trailer
Multiple living units 1      1 equivalent user per apartment
Office                       1 equivalent user
Single-family residences     1 equivalent user
Special user2                Not applicable
 
Notes:
      1.   This basis of charge applicable to multiple living unit not
designated as a special user.
      2.   Each special user shall be evaluated separately based on the flow,
BOD and suspended solids characteristics of the sewage discharged to the sewer.
A copy of the list of special users, the characteristics of their sewage and
the user charge for each shall be kept on file at all times in the office of
the city clerk.
   B.   The equivalent user charge shall be established by the city. The
methods of computation set forth in the schedule (attached to the ordinance
codified herein and on file in the office of the clerk-treasurer) shall be used
in setting all sewer user charges. (Ord. 309 Art. 9, § 2, 1975)
13.08.375: REVISION OF CHARGES:
   A.   The city may install measuring devices at any time to determine the
amount of wastewater and/or collect BOD samples and the city council may change
said sewer service charges and provide for the charges for other than normal
domestic sewage from time to time by resolution or minute entry which shall
become part of schedules 1 through 9 (attached to the ordinance codified herein
and on file in the office of the clerk- treasurer), without the necessity of
amending this article and which shall be the effective sewer service charge
thereafter.
   B.   Revisions of the equivalent user charge and schedule shall be based
upon actual operation, maintenance and administrative expenses and requirements
for funding bond obligations as provided by law and will take into
consideration significant changes in total number of equivalent users and the
equivalent user charge will be reviewed annually and updated to reflect actual
costs. (Ord. 309 Art. 9, § 3, 1975)
13.08.380: INEQUITABLE RATES; APPLICATION FOR REVIEW:
The owner or occupant (“User”) of any premises (“Subject Premises”) which
discharges into the City's Sewage Works (“Sewer Services”) who contends that
the rates charged for Sewer Services pursuant to section
13.08.370 or
13.08.375 of this article are unjust or inequitable (“Inequitable Rate”) may
request an adjustment of the Inequitable Rate by filing a rate adjustment
application with the City Clerk (“Application”) explaining the circumstances
justifying an adjustment of the alleged Inequitable Rate and identifying an
equitable rate for Sewer Services to the Subject Premises. The Application
shall be evaluated by the Sewer Superintendent or such other person appointed
by the Council and said evaluation shall be presented to the Council for
determination. Any cost associated with said evaluation shall be paid by the
Applicant. If the Council determines that the alleged Inequitable Rate is
unjust or inequitable the Council may by resolution establish a fair and
equitable rate (“Equitable Rate”) for Sewer Service to the Subject Premises.
Additionally, upon recommendation by the Sewer Superintendent or such other
person appointed by the Council, the Council may on its own motion find a User
is being charged an Inequitable Rate for Sewer Services. In such an event, the
Council may by resolution establish an Equitable Rate for such premises. As the
sole and exclusive remedy for an Inequitable Rate charged to a User or a
Subject Premises (upon either Application or upon recommendation of the Sewer
Superintendent) the Users account for Sewer Services shall receive a credit for
the amount of any overcharge or additional charge for any undercharge in an
amount equal to the total of any overcharges or undercharges billed to the User
from and after one-hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Application or
recommendation by the Sewer Superintendent. The filing of an Application does
not relieve the user from paying its monthly users fees and charges. Any claims
for Inequitable Rates, including any claims for fee overcharges or billing
errors, shall be filed with the City Clerk in writing within one-hundred eighty
(180) days of the date that such claim arose or be barred. The defined terms in

paid by the tenth day of the month after which said services have been rendered
and have been billed, then water service shall be discontinued for the premises
until full payment of the dual charges and interest and reconnection charges
have been paid in full. (Ord. 309 Art. 9, § 9, 1975)
13.08.400: DELINQUENT CHARGES; DISCONNECTION OF SEWER SERVICE:
As an alternative method of collecting said water and sewer service charges,
the city may disconnect any premises from the sewer system if the user fails to
pay the water and sewer charges for his premises by the tenth day of the month
following the month that the services have been rendered and billed by the
city. The person in charge of the sewer system shall estimate the cost of
disconnection of the premises from the sewer system and the cost of
reconnecting it thereto, and that the user shall deposit with the city the cost
as estimated for disconnecting and reconnecting the sewer system before such
premises is reconnected to the system. In the event the delinquent sewer and
water service charges are paid and the premises is reconnected to the sewer

treatment processes or operations; b) inhibits or disrupts its sludge
processes, use or disposal; or c) is a cause of a violation of the city's NPDES
permit or of the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal in compliance with
any of the following statutory/regulatory provisions or permits issued
thereunder (or more stringent state or local regulations): section 405 of the
clean water act; the solid waste disposal act (SWDA), including title II
commonly referred to as the resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA); any
state regulations contained in any state sludge management plan prepared
pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA; the clean air act; the toxic substances
control act; and the marine protection, research, and sanctuaries act.
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DISCHARGE LIMIT: The maximum concentration (or loading) of a
pollutant allowed to be discharged at any time, determined from the analysis of
any discrete or composited sample collected, independent of the industrial flow
rate and the duration of the sampling event.
MEDICAL WASTE: Isolation wastes, infectious agents, human blood and blood
products, pathological wastes, sharps, body parts, contaminated bedding,
surgical wastes, potentially contaminated laboratory wastes, and dialysis
wastes.
NEW SOURCE: A. Any building, structure, facility or installation from which
there is, or may be, a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under
section 307(c) of the act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided
that:
1. The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at a site
at which no other source is located; or
2. The building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the
process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an
existing source or
3. The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection A2 or A3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
   C.   Construction of a "new source" as defined under this paragraph has
commenced if the owner or operator has:
1. Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site construction
program:
a. Any placement, assembly or installation of facilities or equipment; or
b. Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation, or removal
of existing buildings, structures or facilities which is necessary for the
placement, assembly or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or
2. Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities
or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable
time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified
without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and
design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this paragraph.
NEW USER: A "new user" is not a "new source" and is defined as a user that
applies to the city for a new building permit or any person who occupies an
existing building and plans to discharge wastewater to the city's collection
system after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Any
person that buys an existing facility that is discharging nondomestic
wastewater will be considered an "existing user" if no significant changes are
made in the manufacturing operation.
PASS THROUGH: A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United States
in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge
or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement
of the city's NPDES permit, including an increase in the magnitude or duration
of a violation.
PERMITTEE: A person or user issued a wastewater discharge permit.
PERSON: Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation,

of the wastewater (i.e., pH, temperature, TSS, turbidity, color, BOD, chemical
oxygen demand (COD), toxicity or odor).
PRETREATMENT: The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to (or in lieu or) introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means (except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard).

of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment
plant, or
3. Is designated as such by the city on the basis that it has a reasonable
potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any
pretreatment standard or requirement;
   C.   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsection B of this
definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's
operation or for violating any applicable pretreatment standard or requirement,
the city may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition

13.16.050: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
   A.   General Prohibitions: No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced
into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or
interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether
or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other
national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   B.   Specific Prohibitions: No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater:
      1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of

      2.   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 nor more than 9.0, or otherwise
causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
      3.   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference;
      4.   Pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW;
      5.   Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40°C) unless the
approval authority, upon the request of the POTW, approves alternate
temperature limits;
      6.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; the
concentration as measured by test of BTEX shall not exceed twenty five
milligrams per liter (25 mg/l);

sewers for maintenance or repair;
      10.   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit. Color (in combination with
turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of
the compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than ten percent
(10%) from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life;
      11.   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except as
specifically approved by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state

(Ord. 468 § 2.1, 1995)
13.16.060: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I,
subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated. (Ord. 468 § 2.2,
1995)
13.16.070: STATE REQUIREMENTS:
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by
all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this
chapter or other applicable ordinance. (Ord. 468 § 2.3, 1995)
13.16.080: LOCAL LIMITS:
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through
and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of
the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits:
 Daily Maximum Allowable Discharge Limit (mg/l)
                                     Daily Maximum Allowable Discharge Limit
                                     (mg/l)
Arsenic                              0.25
Cadmium                              0.26

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the
POTW (end of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are for
"total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations
above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable
pretreatment standard shall apply. (Ord. 468 § 2.4, 1995)
13.16.090: CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 468 § 2.5, 1995)
13.16.100: SPECIAL AGREEMENT:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may
also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the
approval authority in accordance with 403.13. (Ord. 468 § 2.6, 1995)
13.16.110: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which he
believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 468 § 2.7, 1995)
13.16.120: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 468 § 2.8, 1995)
13.16.130: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Compliance by existing users (categorical users) covered by categorical
pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard
is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any
existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any
categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than
EPA's categorical pretreatment standards.
   B.   New source dischargers and new users are required to comply with
applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time (not to
exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge). New sources and new users
shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start up, all
pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
before beginning to discharge.
   C.   Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not
contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's
categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical
user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in
noncompliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance
schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance within
the shortest time feasible. (Ord. 468 § 2.9, 1995)
13.16.135: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
   B.   The city and the POTW reserve the right to require a suitable storage
and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow and promulgate
requirements for this facility.
   C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent and shall be
so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at his expense.
   D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 468 § 2.10, 1995)
13.16.140: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the city, facilities to
prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided
and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention
plan/slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before
implementation. The city shall determine which user is required to develop a
plan and require said plan to be submitted within thirty (30) days after
notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as
modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet
the requirements of subsection.
   A.   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/
control slug plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;.
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards in sections
13.16.050 through
13.16.080 of this chapter; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Users shall notify the POTW immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug"
or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by this chapter. The
notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type
of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected, user
shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in addition to the
amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under state or
federal law.
   C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. (Ord. 468 §
2.11, 1995)
13.16.150: SEPTIC TANK WASTES AND RV DUMPS:
   A.   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at a designated
receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are
established by the superintendent. Such wastes shall not violate this section
or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. Wastewater
discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities shall be
issued by the superintendent.
   B.   Septage haulers may only discharge loads at locations specifically
designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The
superintendent may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
   C.   Septage haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every load. This
form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler,
permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste.
   D.   Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the user
fee system as authorized in article 13 of this chapter.
   E.   Recreational vehicles (RV) waste tank effluent is allowed to be
disposed of by the general public at the designated RV dump site as identified
by the city of Kimberly; provided, however, that the RV dump site is for RV
waste tank effluent disposal only and all such wastes shall not violate this
title or any other restrictions or requirements established or adopted by the
city of Kimberly. Commercial haulers are not allowed to discharge any waste or
effluent of any kind into the RV dump site. (Ord. 616, 2014: Ord. 468 § 2.12,
1995)
ARTICLE III. WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS
13.16.160: PERMIT REQUIRED:
No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without
first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the superintendent. Any
violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge
permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with
all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law.
The superintendent may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to
obtain wastewater discharge permits to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 468 § 3, 1995)
13.16.170: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; EXISTING SIU:
Any SIU that was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and that wishes to continue such
discharges in the future shall, within three (3) days after notification by the
superintendent submit a permit application to the city in accordance with
section
13.16.200 of this chapter, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW
to continue after thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter except in accordance with a wastewater discharge
permit issued by the superintendent. (Ord. 468 § 3.1, 1995)
13.16.180: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING; NEW SOURCE AND NEW USER:
At least ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated startup, new sources,
sources that become a user subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard, and new users considered by the city to fit
the definition of SIU, shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit and will

new owner/operator. (Ord. 468 § 3.10, 1995)
13.16.270: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER:
   A.   Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new
owner and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least ninety (90) days'
advance notice to the superintendent and the superintendent approves the
wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the superintendent must
include a written certification by the new owner and/or operator which:
      1.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes;
      2.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
      3.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
   B.   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer.
   C.   Provided that the above occurs and that there were no significant
changes to the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner
will be considered an existing user and be covered by the existing limits and
requirements in the previous owner's permit. (Ord. 468 § 3.11, 1995)
13.16.280: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION:
   A.   Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for, but not limited to,
the following reasons:
      1.   Failure to notify the city of significant changes to the wastewater
prior to the changed discharge;
      2.   Failure to provide prior notification to the city of changed
conditions;
      3.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application;
      4.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
      5.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
      6.   Refusing to allow the city timely access to the facility premises
and records;
      7.   Failure to meet discharge limitations;
      8.   Failure to pay fines;
      9.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      10.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      11.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge

      12.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted
facility;
      13.   If the city has to invoke its emergency provision as cited in
section
13.16.450 of this chapter; or
      14.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms
of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
   B.   Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of
operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits
issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater
discharge permit to that user. (Ord. 468 § 3.12, 1995)
13.16.290: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REISSUANCE:
A user, required to have a wastewater discharge permit, shall apply for
wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, in accordance with section
13.16.200 of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user, whose
existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and has submitted its
reapplication in the time period specified herein, shall be deemed to have an
effective wastewater discharge permit until the city issues or denies the new
wastewater discharge permit. A user, whose existing wastewater discharge permit
has expired and who failed to submit its reapplication in the time period
specified herein, will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater
discharge permit. (Ord. 468 § 3.13, 1995)
ARTICLE IV. SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
13.16.300: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
   A.   A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The superintendent
will determine on a case by case basis whether the user will be able to
composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional
composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow
proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow
proportional is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time
proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4)
grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   B.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city
and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users,
if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For
other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out
dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary
to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
   C.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than
what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40
CFR part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 468 § 4.1, 1995)
13.16.310: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA. (Ord. 468 § 4.2, 1995)
13.16.320: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections
13.16.300 and
13.16.310 of this article. (Ord. 468 § 4.3, 1995)
ARTICLE V. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
13.16.330: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 468 § 5.1, 1995)
13.16.340: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring
facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's
premises; except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed
in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The
superintendent, whenever applicable, may require the construction and
maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end
of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system).
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
   D.   The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment
as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at
its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall
be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 468 § 5.2, 1995)
13.16.350: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the superintendent shall seek issuance of a search and/
or seizure warrant from the district court of the fifth judicial district of
the state of Idaho, in and for the county of Twin Falls. Such warrant shall be
served at reasonable hours by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed
police officer of the city. (Ord. 468 § 5.3, 1995)
13.16.360: VANDALISM:
No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord.
468 § 5.4, 1995)
ARTICLE VI. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
13.16.370: USER INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC UNLESS RECOGNIZED AS
CONFIDENTIAL:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available
to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When
requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report, wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data"
as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 468 § 6, 1995)
ARTICLE VII. PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
13.16.380: USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city shall publish annually, in the "East County Chronicle", a list of the
users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
"significant noncompliance" shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit
for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the
applicable criteria;
   C.   Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through including
endangering the health of city personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s) which the city determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 468 §
7, 1995)
ARTICLE VIII. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.16.390: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation via
certified letter. Within three (3) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 468 § 8.1, 1995)
13.16.400: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 13.60.420 and
13.16.430 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent
order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.2, 1995)
13.16.410: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent may order, via a certified letter, a user which has violated
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the city council of the city of Kimberly at an
open meeting and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least five (5) days prior to
the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.3, 1995)
13.16.420: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance
of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.4, 1995)
13.16.430: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.5,
1995)
13.16.440: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed three hundred
dollars ($300.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of eighteen percent
(18%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the superintendent shall convene a hearing on the matter within thirty
(30) days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.6,
1995)
13.16.450: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
   A.   The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
   B.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent shall allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in section
13.16.460 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   C.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
13.16.410 and
13.16.460 of this chapter.
   D.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 468 § 8.7, 1995)
13.16.460: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (NONEMERGENCY):
   A.   In addition to the provisions in section
13.16.280 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      1.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in article II of this
chapter.
   B.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.16.410 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 468 § 8.8, 1995)
ARTICLE IX. JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.16.470: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may petition the district court of the fifth judicial district
of the state of Idaho, in and for the county of Twin Falls through the city's
attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user. (Ord. 468 § 9.1, 1995)
13.16.480: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum
civil penalty allowed by state statute per violation, per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user,
the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 468 § 9.2,
1995)
13.16.490: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user which has wilfully or negligently violated any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding that allowed by state statute
per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or
both.
   B.   A user which has wilfully or negligently introduced any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty not
exceeding that allowed by state statute and/or be subject to imprisonment for
six (6) months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action
for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
   C.   A user which knowingly made any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsified, tampered with,
or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not exceeding that
allowed by state statute per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more
than six (6) months, or both.
   D.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine
not exceeding that allowed by state statute per violation per day, or
imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. (Ord. 468 § 9.3, 1995)
13.16.500: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The provisions in articles VII through X of this chapter are not exclusive
remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response
plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any
user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions
may be taken concurrently. (Ord. 468 § 9.4, 1995)
ARTICLE X. SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
13.16.510: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 468 § 10.1, 1995)
13.16.520: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 468 § 10.2, 1995)
13.16.530: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 468 § 10.3, 1995)
13.16.540: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, is
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to
the provisions of title 52, Idaho Code, governing such nuisances, including
reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying
said nuisance. (Ord. 468 § 10.4, 1995)
13.16.550: INFORMANT REWARDS:
The superintendent may pay up to that allowed by state statute for information
leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. In the event that the
information provided results in an administrative fine or civil penalty levied
against the user, the superintendent may disperse up to ten percent (10%) of
the collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a single reward
payment may not exceed that allowed by state statute. (Ord. 468 § 10.5, 1995)
13.16.560: CONTRACTOR LISTING:
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale
of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or
services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance
with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion
of the city. (Ord. 468 § 10.6, 1995)
ARTICLE XI. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
13.16.570: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset if this information is provided orally; a written submission must be
provided within three (3) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. (Ord. 468 § 11.1, 1995)
13.16.580: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections
13.16.050A and
13.16.050B3 through B7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either: a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 468 § 11.2, 1995)
13.16.590: BYPASS:
   A.   For the purposes of this section:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   1. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW or the city may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 468 § 11.3, 1995)

         a.   An RF engineering analysis of all utility poles, regardless of
height, and of all towers or structures thirty five feet (35') in height or
higher, within a one thousand three hundred twenty foot (1,320') radius of the
proposed wireless communication facility site.
         b.   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for collocation are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
      4.   Prohibitions: The following are prohibited or restricted:
         a.   Lattice towers are prohibited.
         b.   Interference with city and public safety communication systems
and/or area television or radio broadcast is prohibited.

prohibited.
         d.   Diagonal bracing is permitted only to anchor the antenna to an
existing building to which the antenna is attached.
   C.   Application Procedure: The administrator shall be the granting
authority for wireless communication facility collocating on existing
structures or utility poles. All other wireless communication facilities shall
require a special use permit from the planning and zoning commission. An
application for a special use permit for a wireless communication facility
shall contain the information set forth below, in addition to the standard
application information required for all special use permits:
      1.   A site plan including location, type and height of the proposed
wireless communication facility with setbacks, property lines, adjacent land
uses, structures and zoning.
      2.   Elevation drawings or before and after photographs/drawings
simulating and specifying the location and height of the antennas, support
structures, equipment enclosures and other accessory uses.
      3.   The master development plan showing the location of all existing and
proposed wireless communication facility sites of the applicant within the city
and its area of impact, including the service area of each wireless
communication facility.
      4.   Evidence demonstrating the unavailability of collocation, as set
forth above.
      5.   Certification from the applicant's engineer that collocation of
additional antennas for at least one additional provider is possible on the
proposed pole, and a signed and notarized statement by the applicant agreeing
to accommodate collocation of additional antennas on the tower and that the
applicant agrees to enter into leases with other providers allowing use of the
tower at a monthly lease rate not to exceed one-half (1/2) of the capital cost
of the tower, excluding the equipment to be used exclusively by the applicant,
paid over fifteen (15) years at seven percent (7%) interest. The maximum
monthly lease rate shall be included in the application.
      6.   A lease agreement with the landowner that allows other providers to
locate equipment on the subject property, and provides that if the provider
fails to remove the wireless communication facility and equipment within ninety
(90) days of its discontinued use, the responsibility for removal shall belong
to the landowner.

reference shall become a part of this title. The number of the ordinance
creating the basic zoning subdistrict shall be clearly shown on the "official
zoning map", "development map" and any other official document relating to a
particular zoning subdistrict.
The ordinance and map may encompass one or more zoning districts and one or
more basic zoning subdistricts together with any appurtenant secondary zoning
districts all within one particular zoning district whenever it can be shown to
the satisfaction of the council that the mixture of zoning districts and
subdistricts is compatible with the intent of the zoning subdistrict provisions

17.10.040: REGULATIONS FOR PARKING OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
The purpose of the parking overlay districts is established to accommodate the
need for off street parking development alternatives in accordance with traffic
patterns, ultimate densities and coordinated use of lands within the city. It
is intended that the respective districts with which the parking district is
combined shall have requirements particular to the land and uses that warrant
off street parking variables to be applied.
The following regulations of this chapter shall apply to all land classified as
a "parking district" (P). All uses are subject to the provisions of those
districts. If any of the regulations specified in this section differ from
corresponding regulations specified for a district with which the P district is
combined, then the regulations of this district shall govern. (Ord. 542, 2007)

17.11.090: Pressurized Irrigation
17.11.010: IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
The improvements herein shall be required whenever a building or structure is
constructed, placed, erected or enlarged or when there is a change of use of a
building, structure or parcel of land. Unless otherwise provided, all required
improvements shall be a condition of any building permit and they shall be
completed prior to final inspection and occupancy of the building. If cost of
improvements required by sections
17.11.020 through
17.11.060 of this chapter exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the cost of the
proposed private improvements, an agreement may be negotiated to allow the
required improvements to be staged over a period of time not to exceed three
(3) years. Whenever a building is constructed, placed, erected or enlarged and
that building is in an isolated or undeveloped area, public improvements may be
deferred by the council in cases where a deferral would otherwise be
unavailable. Any improvements required by sections
17.11.020 through
17.11.060 of this chapter are not required for minor modifications or additions
to existing buildings or structures when the modifications and improvements do
not constitute more than a twenty five percent (25%) increase over the square
footage of the existing buildings or a total increase in square footage over
ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is less, within any twelve (12)
month period from date of completion or other expansion.
If a single building of a premises containing multiple buildings is expanded
over twenty five percent (25%) of that building's square footage but less than
a total of twenty five percent (25%) of the combined square footage of all
buildings, the improvements required by sections
17.11.020 through
17.11.060 of this chapter shall be provided for the building being expanded
only. If the expansion is greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet or
greater than twenty five percent (25%) of the combined footage of all
buildings, the improvements required by sections
17.11.020 through
17.11.060 of this chapter shall be provided for the entire premises. (Ord. 542,
2007)
17.11.015: BUILDING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS:

sloped roof. All sloped roofs shall have a three (3) in twelve inch (12")
minimum slope. Wood shingles are prohibited.
      4.   All buildings with a footprint of ten thousand (10,000) square feet
and greater shall incorporate sloped roof elements including, but not limited
to, pitched roofs on towers or arcades, sloped awnings, or sloped parapets. The
sloped elements shall be provided along a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of
each wall's length. All sloped roof elements shall have a three (3) in twelve
inch (12") minimum slope. Wood shingles are prohibited.
      5.   In the CG, CI, CB, and RP zoning districts, an articulated parapet
wall or cornice may be used in place of the sloped roof as required in
subsections A3 and A4 of this section.
      6.   All buildings shall be designed to incorporate a form of
architectural articulation every thirty feet (30'), both horizontally along
each wall's length and vertically along each wall's height. Acceptable
articulation may include the following:
         a.   Canopies, awnings, or porticos;
         b.   Recesses/projections;
         c.   Arcades;
         d.   Arches;

match the color of the building or an accent color. Natural metal finishes
(patina) are an acceptable alternative to paint.
   B.   Exterior Construction Of Main Buildings:
      1.   The exterior facades of a main building or structure, excluding
glass windows and doors, in the CG, CI, CB and RP zoning districts shall be
constructed of one hundred percent (100%) masonry, unless otherwise specified
in this title. Cementatious fiberboard is considered masonry, but may only
constitute fifty percent (50%) of stories other than the first story.
Cementatious fiberboard may also be used for architectural features, including
window box outs, bay windows, roof dormers, garage door headers, columns,
chimneys not part of an exterior wall, or other architectural features approved
by the plan reviewer. Wood roof shingles are prohibited.
      2.   Metal buildings are permitted in the RP zoning district upon review
by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city council subject
to:
         a.   The maximum height of metal buildings is thirty five feet (35');
         b.   The lot on which the building is constructed must have frontage
only on streets with fifty feet (50') of right of way or greater;
         c.   The lot containing a metal building shall be three hundred feet
(300') from all zoning districts except light industrial;
         d.   The wall of the building facing the street must be one hundred
percent (100%) masonry, or stucco; and
         e.   Other walls of the building visible from a street must have trees
planted on thirty foot (30') centers within twenty five feet (25') of the
building.
      3.   Exterior construction of maintenance buildings for golf courses,
public or parochial schools, churches, or the city of Kimberly may be metal
upon issuance of a special use permit. Exterior construction of buildings used
for agricultural purposes in conjunction with a school may be metal upon
issuance of a special use permit.
If an expansion or an addition to an existing metal building is not greater
than ten percent (10%) or seven thousand (7,000) square feet, whichever is
greater, the masonry requirements shall not apply to the expansion or addition
to the existing metal building.
      4.   The city council may approve materials which are equivalent to, or
exceed, the standards set forth in this section. (Ord. 576 § 2, 2009)
17.11.020: LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Minimum Standards: The required minimum size landscaped area shall, as
a minimum, have the following plant life:
      1.   One tree per five hundred (500) square feet of landscaped area. At
least fifty percent (50%) of the required trees shall be evergreens. All trees
shall have a height of at least four feet (4') when planted.
      2.   One bush per three hundred (300) square feet of landscaped area. At
least fifty percent (50%) of the required bushes shall be evergreens.
      3.   The commission and/or design review committee may approve
alternative plans or designs to allow innovative landscaping.
   B.   Approval And Completion:
      1.   A landscaping plan conforming to the minimum requirements of this
section shall be submitted for approval as part of the development map whenever
a PUD or MH zoning subdistrict is submitted for approval. A landscaping plan
conforming to the minimum requirements of this section shall be submitted for
approval as part of the application for a building permit to construct a
building.
      2.   Landscaping conforming to the approved landscaping plan shall be
completed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for the appurtenant
building or at such other time as may be agreed upon in writing by the
administrator and landowner; however, said agreement shall not extend the
completion date beyond the next normal planting season for the proposed
vegetation.
      3.   All landscaping shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the
minimum requirements of this section for as long as the building is occupied.
(Ord. 542, 2007)
17.11.030: SCREENING:
   A.   Screening Required:
      1.   Screening shall be required between any residential use and any
trade or manufacturing use in adjacent zoning districts or any zoning district
where both such uses are permitted outright and may be required around any
special use. The trade, manufacturing or special use shall provide any required
screening. Screening shall not be required if a public trafficway other than a
service road separates the two (2) uses.
      2.   Screening shall be required between an MH zoning subdistrict and any
other zoning district or subdistrict except another MH subdistrict and
screening may be required between a PUD or MH zoning subdistrict and any other
zoning district or subdistrict. The zoning subdistrict shall provide any
required screening.
      3.   No wrecking yard or wrecking house or junkyard or junk house shall
be established unless the same shall be completely surrounded by a fence of
wood, concrete or slatted chainlink not less than eight feet (8') in height
from the level of the ground and completely obscuring the wreckage and parts
therein from outside view.
   B.   Minimum Standards:
      1.   Screening shall be a minimum six foot (6') fence or wall or a
landscaped area or any combination thereof. If it is a fence or wall it shall
be constructed of wood, solid vinyl, metal, concrete or concrete block. If it
is a landscaped area, it shall be evergreen bushes or trees and may include an
earthen berm.
      2.   Whenever bushes or trees are used as screening, the screening height
may not be less than three feet (3') at the time of planting, providing a
minimum height of six feet (6') is achieved within six (6) years after
planting.
      3.   Screening shall completely obscure objects inside the screened area
when viewed from any angle outside the screened area and shall be constructed
so as to reduce noise, lights and blowing trash.
   C.   Exceptions: Screening shall not be constructed so as to create a
traffic hazard and it shall conform to the height restrictions in the chapters
establishing dimensional standards in zoning districts and subdistricts. (Ord.
542, 2007)
17.11.040: PARKING AREAS:
   A.   Pedestrian Access: Access to each building shall be provided by
connecting the principal entrance into each building to the parking areas
intended for the use of the occupants with a sidewalk that is not more than
three hundred feet (300') in length.
   B.   Surfacing: All parking and maneuvering areas shall be hard surfaced
with Portland concrete or asphaltic concrete surface material. In the LI zoning
district the requirement does not apply.
   C.   Striping: Parking areas that are intended to provide more than ten (10)
spaces on a single site shall be marked off with a four inch by fifteen foot
(4" x 15') long painted stripe along the sides of each parking space.
   D.   Lighting: Parking areas that are intended to provide more than eighteen
(18) spaces on a single site shall have lighting that will provide at least one
foot-candle of light at the ground surface on the entire parking site. Lighting
shall be screened so that it does not directly illuminate any adjacent
residential uses with more than one-fourth (0.25) of a foot-candle and so that
it does not create a traffic hazard.
   E.   Vehicle Access:
      1.   Any motor vehicle entrance to a public trafficway from private
property shall be considered a driveway approach and shall conform to the
standards established herein.
      2.   The city engineer shall establish construction standards for all
driveway approaches. The standard depressed curb type approach shall be
constructed unless otherwise directed by the city engineer. The city engineer
may require an arterial street driveway approach, with rounded curbing when
traffic conditions on arterial streets warrant a more rapid entrance and exit
through the driveway approach. This decision of the city engineer requiring an
arterial street driveway approach may be appealed to city council. Nothing in
this subsection should be construed to prevent the construction of an arterial
street driveway approach, if desired by the property owner.
      3.   The City Engineer may allow driveway approaches conforming to the
following standards, providing they do not pose any unusual traffic hazards:
         a.   Residential use driveway approaches: Shall not exceed twelve feet
(12') for a single drive or twenty feet (20') for a double drive. Joint use
drives between two (2) separate properties to serve multi-family residences
will be allowed; however, the total width of the curb cut shall not exceed
forty feet (40'). There shall be at least twenty five feet (25') between
driveways entering curb between the end of a driveway and the end of a corner
radius and at least two feet (2') between the end of a driveway and side
property line.
         b.   Commercial and manufacturing use driveway approaches: Shall not
exceed forty feet (40') nor be less than thirty feet (30') except one-way
approaches which shall not be less than twelve feet (12'). There shall be at
least twenty five feet (25') of curb between driveways and at least eighteen
feet (18') of straight curb between the end of driveways and the end of a
corner radius and at least thirteen feet (13') between the end of a driveway
and a side property line when parking is allowed on the street.
         c.   The City Engineer may allow curb cuts up to sixty five feet (65')
for commercial or industrial drives where it appears that it is necessary to
accommodate large trucks and trailers and to reduce the distance between a
commercial or industrial driveway and a side property line when on street
parking is not allowed or not practical because of existing conditions. The
public welfare, safety and convenience shall be considered in granting such
applications.
         d.   The City Engineer may allow additional driveway width under the
following conditions: the street is not an arterial or collector street; the
traffic generated by the land use is minimal (no high traffic generating retail
trade uses, services, residential uses or public assembly); a parking plan is
submitted and adhered to that conforms to section
17.10.030 of this title; and driveways conform to standard slope and height
dimensions to control drainage. (Ord. 542, 2007)
17.11.050: STREETS:
   A.   Adequate Access: No building shall be constructed or erected on a lot
in a zoning district unless adequate access to a fifty foot (50') wide minimum
standard all weather public trafficway is provided. Said access may be a
private drive providing such drive conforms to the following chart and must be
approved by the Public Works Supervisor, City Engineer and the City Fire
Marshal:
 
      Private Driveway Length
Width 100'     150'     200'     250'     300'
15'   5 units  4 units  n/a      n/a      n/a
20'   8 units  7 units  6 units  n/a      n/a
25'   10 units 10 units 8 units  8 units  n/a
30'   12 units 12 units 12 units 12 units 12 units
 
In commercial and manufacturing zoning districts, a private drive may not
exceed three hundred feet (300') in length, must have a width of twenty feet
(20') for one-way traffic and twenty five feet (25') for two-way traffic and
may not serve a total building area of over fifty thousand (50,000) square
feet.
The City Council may approve additional driveway length in excess of three
hundred feet (300') in cases where isolated parcels of land cannot be developed
with minimum fifty foot (50') dedicated right-of-way.
Such a private drive shall be surfaced with Portland concrete or asphaltic
concrete. No zoning subdistrict will be allowed that does not have direct
access to a fifty foot (50') wide minimum standard all weather paved public
trafficway.
   B.   Curb, Gutter And Sidewalk:
      1.   New curbs, gutters and sidewalks shall be constructed at the expense
of the property owner with, and at the same time as, all new construction or
modification of existing buildings in accordance with City standards on all
streets, within and adjacent to the development, and in all zoning districts
except the Agricultural District, for all land uses, except where the Public
Works Director determines that, due to the location or character of the
development, new curbs, gutters and/or sidewalks need not be constructed.
      2.   The City Engineer may defer the construction of required curbs,
gutters and/or sidewalks until other curbs, gutters and/or sidewalks are
constructed adjacent to other lands in the neighborhood under any one or more
of the following conditions:
         a.   If the total length of existing curb-gutter on both sides of the
street in an existing development plus the length of the property in question
is less than forty percent (40%) of the total property length adjacent to a
standard block unless the curb-gutter will connect to an existing curb-gutter
section. The standard block shall be the distance between two (2) intersecting
streets or four hundred feet (400') whichever is less. The same criteria shall
apply separately to sidewalks. All curb-gutter to be considered as existing
shall be acceptable line and grade.
         b.   If another governmental agency having jurisdiction over a
particular street requests the curb-gutter be deferred.
         c.   If existing curbs, gutters and/or sidewalks are in good repair
and to an acceptable line and grade that conforms to the line and grade of
other curbs, gutters and/or sidewalks in the standard block, it may be
retained.
      3.   Curbs, gutters and sidewalks shall not be required or allowed to be
constructed or may be deferred if, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the
improvement would create a traffic hazard or an unusual drainage problem.
   C.   Construction Standards For Vertical And Rolled Curb: Both vertical and
rolled curbs shall be allowed in the City in accordance with the provisions of
this Code and in conformance with the standard construction design and
specification for the same, as are on file in the City Engineer's Office. The
most recent construction design and specifications shall prevail.
Standard detail C-2 (4 inch rolled curb) shall be used only when the following
applicable conditions are met:
      1.   On local residential streets in new developments, when the top of
curb to top of curb street drainage capacity is not exceeded by the peak flow
generated during a 50-year 24-hour storm. It shall be the developer's
engineering consultant's responsibility to compile and submit drainage
calculations to the City for review and approval.
      2.   On residential cul-de-sac streets in new developments that meet the
drainage requirements set forth in subsection C1 of this section.
      3.   On local residential streets in existing developments where no curb
or gutter exists in the block under consideration and a study by the City
Engineer indicates that the proposed installation will meet the drainage
requirements set forth in subsection C1 of this section.
      4.   In all cases four inch (4") rolled curb shall be transitioned into
six inch (6") vertical curb around all curb returns.
   D.   Public Improvement Requirements: In areas where two (2) or more zoning
districts or subdistricts abut, and said zoning districts or subdistricts have
different public improvement requirements, the Council may impose the least
restrictive requirement if the Council finds that imposition of the least
restrictive requirements will further the policies and purposes described in
this title. (Ord. 647, 2017)
17.11.060: SANITATION FACILITIES:
   A.   Waste Pens: A waste pen of sufficient size to accommodate all trash or
solid waste stored on the premises shall be provided in any zoning district or
subdistrict except buildings containing two (2) or less household units. All
waste pens shall be completely surrounded with a well maintained fence or wall

practices (BMPs) to retain as much stormwater as possible on the property.
   B.   Highway Drainage: Drainage to a state highway shall be subject to the
regulations of the Idaho transportation department. Necessary permits shall be
acquired by the developer.
   C.   Road Drainage: Drainage to a road under the care, custody and control
of the Twin Falls highway district shall be subject to their regulations.
Necessary permits shall be acquired by the developer.
   D.   Drainage To U.S. Waters Or Canals: No drainage shall be allowed from a
building site directly to any waters of the United States or to any privately
owned canal system.
   E.   Residential Subdivisions:
      1.   All residential subdivisions shall design and construct stormwater
retention facility or facilities to retain the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm
event.
      2.   The stormwater shall be detained and released over a forty eight
(48) hour period or at a rate that is approved by the Twin Falls Canal Company
or by any other entity that may govern the waterway downstream.
      3.   The stormwater dischargers releasing water from their retention area
shall use best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the amount of pollutants
from the water. Discharge water quality shall comply with the most current
regulations or standards that may apply.
      4.   The retention facilities shall also have an overflow device that can
convey the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm event, without damage to the retention
facility. This structure should be designed to minimize any downstream safety
problems.
      5.   Storm sewers shall be placed in a public right of way or minimum
fifteen foot (15') wide easement. Easements shall also be required for the
retention areas. The city reserves the right to modify the retention facilities
to stay in compliance with any state or federal regulation.

developments shall design and construct stormwater retention facilities to
retain the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm event. No discharge of stormwater will be
allowed from these areas.
   G.   Procedure For Review And Approval Of The Stormwater Management Plan:
Review and approval by the city does not constitute an engineering review of
project plans and calculations. The review is for the purpose of ensuring
general conformance to city policies and requirements. The submitting engineer
is solely responsible for the design. All submissions to the city shall be
stamped by a professional engineer registered in the state of Idaho.
The following shall be submitted to the city:
      1.   Topographic survey of the development showing all drainage and
irrigation water conveyance systems within the area encompassed by a line two
hundred feet (200') outside the property line.
      2.   Peak flow calculations, with peak flows delineated on the drawings.
      3.   Runoff volume calculations.
      4.   Plans and profiles of new or modified drainage and irrigation water
conveyance systems.
      5.   Plans, profiles and calculations for stormwater retention or
detention facilities.
      6.   Flood routing computations for the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm event
through any existing drainage conveyance systems.
      7.   Maintenance and operation manuals for stormwater facilities.
      8.   Infiltration rates where applicable.
      9.   Seasonal high ground water table elevations where applicable. This
applies when the absorption of stormwater is used as a best management
practice.
Facilities using absorption designs shall not intercept the postdevelopment
ground water table. The bottom of the facility shall have a minimum four foot
(4') vertical separation from the seasonal high ground water elevation and
bedrock. The four foot (4') separation between the bottom of the facility and
the seasonal high ground water table shall contain a sandy loam material to
treat the water prior to entering the ground water. If the best management
practices are utilized to pretreat the water prior to discharge into the
absorption facility, the requirement for four feet (4') of sandy loam will be
waived.
The seasonal high ground water table elevation shall be established and used
for the facility design. The elevation of the seasonal high ground water table
shall be determined by a monitoring well established at the facility site and
monitored during the high ground water season. If available, Twin Falls health
department ground water records may be used to establish the probable highest
ground water elevation. The high ground water elevation shall be shown on the
plans and be referenced to a nearby bench mark, the latitude and longitude of
the well shall be shown on the plans. If ground water is encountered during
construction of the facility at an elevation higher than that shown on the
plans, the facility shall be redesigned to account for the higher elevation.
      10.   Soil classifications where applicable.
      11.   Flood routing of the 100-year 24-hour rainstorm event to the
ultimate drainage system.
      12.   Copies of associated permits and discharge agreements.
      13.   Copy of the pollution prevention plan that is on file with the EPA
for the development.
Prior to beginning of construction on any development site larger than five (5)
acres, the developer or their representative must have a pollution prevention
plan in place and must file a notice of intent (NOI) with the EPA, in
accordance with NPDES (national pollutant discharge elimination system)
requirements. The pollution prevention plan will include provisions for
reducing sediment discharges from the construction site and tracking of mud
onto roadways. A copy of this plan and the NOI shall be provided to the city
prior to any site grading. Refer to 40 CFR chapter 1, section 122.26 stormwater
discharges for NPDES requirements. (Ord. 542, 2007)
17.11.090: PRESSURIZED IRRIGATION:
   A.   System Installation Required: In each subdivision the developer shall
provide pressurized irrigation water to each and every lot within the
subdivision. The pressurized irrigation system shall be constructed and
installed at the same time as the domestic water lines, but shall not
necessarily be in the same trenches.
   B.   Cross Connections Prohibited: There shall be no cross connections
between the domestic water lines and the irrigation water lines that do not
comply with title 13,
chapter 13.04, article II, of this code.
   C.   Approval By City Engineer: All such pressurized irrigation water
systems shall be approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 542, 2007)

17.12.030: DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Minimum Design Standards Required: All plats submitted pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, and all subdivisions, improvements and facilities
done, constructed or made in accordance with said provisions shall comply with
the minimum design standards set forth hereinafter in this chapter; provided,
however, that any more restrictive standards adopted by any highway district,
state highway department or health agency shall prevail over those set forth
herein; and further provided that any minimum lot size restrictions promulgated
by the health authority shall prevail over those set forth herein.
   B.   Dedication Of Streets: Within a proposed subdivision arterial and
collector streets as shown on a comprehensive plan, shall be dedicated to the
public in all cases; in general, all other streets shall also be dedicated to
public use.

following:
      1.   Street Location And Arrangements: All street locations shall conform
to the Kimberly master street plan where applicable. Collector type streets
may, for aesthetic reasons, curve and wind in accordance with these standards,
but such trafficways shall maintain a grid type pattern approximately one-
fourth (1/4) of a mile square.
      2.   Stub Streets: Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall be such that said streets
extend to the boundary line of the tract to make provisions for the future
extension of said streets into adjacent areas. A vehicular nonaccess reserve
strip may be required and held in public ownership. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall
be required.
      3.   Relation To Topography: Streets shall be arranged in proper relation
to topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets and acceptable

way.
      6.   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where unusual
circumstances make such necessary to the reasonable development of a tract,
special justification shall be presented for variance requests to the
commission. Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be dedicated within such
tract. A vehicular nonaccess reserve street may be required and held in public
ownership.

   E.   Street Names: The naming of streets shall conform to the following:
      1.   Street names shall not duplicate any existing name within the limits
of the city of Kimberly or the area of impact except where a new street is a
continuation of an existing street. Street names, if spelled differently but
phonetically similar, shall not be used. The city reserves the right to name or
rename any streets.
      2.   All new streets shall be named as follows: Streets having
predominantly north-south direction shall be named "street" or "way"; streets
having a predominately east-west direction shall be named "avenue" or "road";
meandering streets shall be named "drive", "lane", "path", or "trail"; and cul-
de-sacs shall be named "circle", "court" or "place".
      3.   When any new subdivision contains any street, which is a
continuation of any street, such new street shall take the name of such
existing street. No new street not a continuation of an existing street shall
be given the same or similar name of any existing street. The city engineer
shall have the power to change the name of any street on any map or plat
submitted to make such map or plat conform to the provisions of this section.

subdivision or existing subdivisions and to adjacent arterial or collector
streets with paved pedestrian walkways at least five feet (5') wide within the
applicable easements.
   H.   Utility And Drainageway Easements: Unobstructed utility easements shall
be provided along front lot lines, rear lot lines and side lot lines when
deemed necessary; total easement width shall be in accordance with subsection M
of this section. Unobstructed drainage easements shall be provided as required

drainageways shown in the approved drainage plan shall be neither obstructed
nor substantially regraded by the property owners.
   I.   Lots: Lots shall conform to the following:
      1.   Zoning: The lot width, depth and total area shall not be less than
the requirements of an applicable zoning district.
      2.   Future Arrangements: Where parcels of land are subdivided into
unusually large lots (such as when large lots are approved for septic tanks),
the parcels shall be divided, where feasible, so as to allow for the ultimate
extension of adjacent streets through the middle of wide blocks. Whenever such
future subdividing or lot splitting is contemplated the plan thereof shall be
approved by the commission prior to the taking of such action.
      3.   Sufficient Area For Septic Tank: Where individual septic tanks have
been authorized, sufficient area shall be provided for a replacement sewage
disposal system.
   J.   Planting Strips And Reserve Strips: Planting strips and reserve strips
shall conform to the following:
      1.   Planting Strips: Planting strips shall be required to be placed next
to incompatible features such as highways, railroads, commercial or industrial
uses to screen the view from residential properties. Such screening shall be a
minimum of twenty feet (20') wide, and shall not be a part of the normal street
right- of-way or utility easement.
      2.   Reserve Strips:
         a.   Private Reserve Strips: Privately held reserve strips controlling
access to streets shall be prohibited.
         b.   Public Reserve Strips: A one foot (1') reserve may be required to
be placed along half streets which are within the subdivision boundaries and
shall be deeded in fee simple to the City for future street widening.
   K.   Public Sites, Open Spaces, Recreation And Stormwater Retention/
Detention: Where it is determined that a proposed park, playground, school or
other public use as shown on the future acquisition map, as authorized in Idaho
Code section 67-6517, is located in whole or in part within a proposed
subdivision the commission shall notify the appropriate public agency
concerning the land proposed to be acquired. Within thirty (30) days of the
date of notice, the public agency may request the Governing Body to suspend
consideration on the subdivision for sixty (60) days. If an agreement is not
reached within sixty (60) days the commission shall resume consideration of the
subdivision.
No plat shall be approved unless it includes provision for open space, parks
and recreation and stormwater retention/detention. Developers may combine land
designated for stormwater retention/detention with the requirement of open
space, parks and recreation with the approval of the Administrator and/or
Design Review Committee.
      1.   A "park" is a parcel of land dedicated to the public, maintained for
the primary purposes of recreation and open space. A "minipark" is a park that
is a minimum of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet. A "neighborhood park" is
a park that includes at least three (3) acres of flat open space.
      2.   The developer of each residential subdivision, or any part thereof,
without regard to the number of phases within the subdivision, shall set aside
or acquire land within, adjacent to, or in the general vicinity of the
subdivision for neighborhood parks. Neighborhood parks shall be located so as
to serve the largest number of household lots, as is practical, without
crossing an arterial street. The number of acres of land set aside for
neighborhood parks shall be a minimum of the sum of the number of household
units in the subdivision multiplied by 0.01. The zoning administrator, public
works supervisor and/or the design review committee may approve up to fifty
percent (50%) of this land contribution for development of walking/bicycle
trails.
      3.   Development of miniparks and neighborhood parks shall include curbs,
gutters, finish grading, sidewalks, power box, irrigation systems, ground
cover, trees, picnic tables, benches and playground equipment, approved by the
zoning administrator, public works supervisor and city engineer.
      4.   All park land shall be dedicated to the city upon completion of all
required improvements, and accepted and maintained by the city after it is
determined that all standards have been met.
      5.   The city council may determine that park land dedication or cash
contributions are not required for subdivisions located out of the city limits
based on city maintenance costs, lack of public benefit based on the distance/
separation from developed areas of the city and the size. The city council may,
at their discretion, approve and accept cash contributions in lieu of park land
with improvements, which contributions shall be used for park land acquisition
and/or park improvements within the boundaries of the arterial streets in which
the development is located or where deemed appropriate by the council. The fee
structure for cash contributions for acquisition of park land shall be the
appraised value of the required land area at the time of the application. The
appraisal shall be submitted by a mutually agreed upon appraiser and paid for
by the applicant. The fee structure for park improvements, including all costs
of acquisition, construction and all related costs, shall be based upon the
estimated costs of an approved improvement provided by a qualified contractor
and/or vendor.
      6.   Provide retention/detention basins within open space in the
development to be maintained by a property owners' association. Provide safety
signs on all retention/detention basins.
      7.   Provide retention/detention area at one location within the
development to be maintained by the property owners' association.
      8.   Develop retention/detention within a parcel of land a minimum size
of five (5) acres to be maintained by the property owners' association.
      9.   Develop retention/detention areas within greenways with bicycle and
walking trails, to be dedicated to the public, if said greenway is part of an
overall city trail system.
   L.   Restrictive Covenants: Restrictive covenants may be prepared and
recorded as part of a subdivision. This is done to provide protection to future
property owners by establishing higher standards than required under other
regulations. The provisions within protective covenants are enforceable solely
through civil actions and local governments shall not be required to enforce
these provisions.

17.12.040: IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Responsibility For Plans: It shall be the responsibility of the
developer of every proposed subdivision to have prepared by a registered
engineer, a complete set of construction plans, including profiles, cross
sections, specifications and other supporting data, for all required public
streets, utilities and other facilities. Such construction plans shall be based
on preliminary plans that have been approved with the preliminary plat, and
shall be prepared in conjunction with the final plat. Construction plans are
subject to approval by the responsible public agencies. All construction plans
shall be prepared in accordance with the public agencies' standards or
specifications.
   B.   Required Public Improvements: Every developer shall be required to
install the following public and other improvements in accordance with the
conditions and specifications as follows:
      1.   Monuments: Monuments shall be set in accordance with Idaho Code
section 50-1303.
      2.   Streets And Alleys: All streets and alleys shall be constructed in
accordance with the standards and specifications adopted by the Council.
      3.   Curbs And Gutters: Curbs and gutters shall be constructed on all
streets and service roads. All construction shall be in accordance with the
standards and specifications adopted by the Council.
      4.   Bicycle Pathways: A bicycle pathway shall be required within all
subdivisions, as part of the public right-of-way or separate easement, as may
be specified in an overall bicycle plan as adopted by the Council.
      5.   Installation Of Public Utilities: Underground utilities shall be
required in all new subdivisions. Existing utilities or new large transmission
lines shall not be required to be buried.
      6.   Driveways: All driveway openings in curbs shall be as specified by
the administration, highway district or State Highway Department.
      7.   Storm Drainage: An adequate storm drainage system shall be required
in all subdivisions. The requirements for each particular subdivision shall be
established by the City Engineer and/or the Council. Construction shall follow
the specifications and procedures established by the Council.
      8.   Public Water Supply And Sewer Systems: All new public water supply
or sewer systems shall be an extension of an existing public system.
      9.   Fire Hydrants And Water Mains: Adequate fire protection shall be
required in accordance with standards established by the City Engineer.
      10.   Street Name Signs: Street name signs shall be installed in the
appropriate locations at each street intersection in accordance with the local
standards. Cost of street signs shall be the responsibility of the developer.
      11.   Sidewalks And Pedestrian Walkways: Sidewalks shall be required on
both sides of the street, except that where the average width of lots, as
measured at the street frontage line or at the building setback line, is over
two hundred ten feet (210'), sidewalks on only one side of the street may be
allowed. These requirements may be waived by the Council due to the location
and/or character of the development. Pedestrian walkways, when required, shall
have easements at least ten feet (10') in width and include a paved walk at
least five feet (5') in width. Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be constructed in
accordance with the standards and specifications as adopted by the Council.
      12.   Greenbelt: Greenbelt or landscaping screening may be required for
the protection of residential properties from adjacent major arterial streets,
waterways, railroad rights-of-way or other features. Subdivision plats shall
show the location of any greenbelt areas.
      13.   Street Lighting: Streetlights shall be required to be installed at
intersections throughout the subdivision. Lighting shall be approved by the
City Engineer and the cost shall be borne by the developer.
      14.   Mailboxes: Mailbox locations shall be reviewed and approved by the
Zoning Administrator and/or the United States Postal Service.
      15.   Irrigation Water: Effective August 1, 2008, every subdivider or
developer shall be required to install a pressure irrigation system in
accordance with the conditions and specifications as follows:
         a.   The use of the City's potable water supply for irrigation in all
new developments is strictly prohibited. For purposes of this section, the term
"new development" means any new subdivision, PUD, or any development of any
parcel of land larger than three- fourths (3/4) of an acre that is not part of
a subdivision or PUD.
         b.   All new developments shall install a pressure irrigation system
constructed to ISPWC standards and City standards per resolution 213,
excluding, the SCADA system criteria, the connection to existing Municipal
water system criteria and the building criteria prohibiting pre-constructed/
self-contained building components. The building criteria shall allow for pre-
constructed self-contained building modules for the pump station equipment. The
PI system shall be approved by the City Engineer and the City Public Works
Superintendent/Director. The pump station shall be operational before the first
building permit is issued for that station's service area.
         c.   The City Council may approve a variance from the requirement of a
pressure irrigation system, where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this subsection would result in an unnecessary
hardship.
            (1)   Special conditions may include, but are not limited to, small
developments in terms of acreage, developments without viable access to
irrigation water delivery, or developments without Twin Falls Canal Company
water shares.
            (2)   Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience
or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this title
would result in unnecessary hardship.
            (3)   A variance shall not be authorized from the requirement of an
operating pressurized irrigation system unless an alternate provision has been
approved by the City Council. Alternate systems may include, but shall not be
limited to, required Xeriscaping (i.e., landscaping in ways that do not require
supplemental irrigation), payment of an in lieu fee equal to the estimated cost
of construction of an operating pressurized irrigation system (including land
acquisition and value of water shares), or some combination of these or other
acceptable options, approved by the City Engineer and Public Works
Superintendent.
         d.   If the City Council and Public Works Director determine that the
PI system is to be owned and maintained by the developer, Home Owners
Association and home owners, applicable Twin Falls Canal Company water shares
shall, not be conveyed to the City and that one irrigation water share for each
acre of property within the development, shall be retained within the
development for all irrigation in perpetuity.
         e.   If the City Council and Public Works Director determine that the
PI system is to be owned and maintained by the City, each new development shall
convey one share of Twin Falls Canal Company for each acre of property within
the development to the City before filing of the final plat.
         f.   All users connected to a pressurized irrigation system shall
install automatic timers to ensure that conservation of and schedules for use
of the water are met in the most efficient manner possible. Systems operating
without the use of automatic timers will be in violation of this Code and
subject to established fines and penalties herein.
         g.   Monthly fees for water districts will be established and assessed
to each user by the City of Kimberly to maintain the pressure irrigation
system. The fees will be calculated and assessed by total square footage of the
lot size. The fee for calculation will be assessed at a rate of $0.001325 per
square foot of lot size and will be billed monthly at one-twelfth (1/12) the
annual rate.
For example: A typical 8,000 square foot lot would be $0.001325 x 8,000 = 10.60
x 12 month/1 year = $127.20 annually. The monthly billing would then be 1/12
the annual rate or $10.60 a month.
The fees may be changed by resolution of the City Council.
         h.   All residences within the City of Kimberly with pressurized
irrigation systems shall irrigate and water flowers, lawns, gardens, trees, and
shrubs as follows: Residences with even number addresses shall water on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays only; residences with odd number addresses
shall water on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays only.
   C.   Guarantee Of Completion Of Improvements:
      1.   Financial Guarantee Arrangements: In lieu of the actual installation
of required public improvements before recording of the final plat, the Council
may permit the developer to execute a trust and escrow agreement and record a
notice prohibiting the sale of an undeveloped lot without a recorded
developer's agreement between the developer and the City relating to that lot,
or to provide a financial guarantee of performance in one or a combination of
the following arrangements for those requirements which are over and beyond the
requirements of any other agency responsible for the administration, operation
and maintenance of the applicable public improvement:
         a.   Surety Bond:
            (1)   Accrual: The bond shall accrue to the City covering
construction, operation and maintenance of the specific public improvement.

the same district under the terms of this title.
            (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
            (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
A variance shall not be granted unless the commission makes specific findings
of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it which support
conclusions that the above mentioned standards and conditions have been met by
the applicant.

property; the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and
vibration on adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with
adjacent and other properties in the district; and the relationship of the
proposed use to the comprehensive plan.
      4.   Standards Applicable To Special Uses: The commission shall review
the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed special use in terms of
the following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing that such use
at the proposed location:
         a.   Will, in fact, constitute a special use as established by zoning
requirements for the zone involved.
         b.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives or with any specific objective of a comprehensive plan and/or zoning
regulations.
         c.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area.
         d.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
         e.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
         f.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community.
         g.   Will not involve use, activities, processes, material, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property or
to the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors.
         h.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property that shall be so
designed as not to create any interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares. All parking, loading, unloading for the special use, shall be
onsite, not in any public right of way including alleys, unless otherwise
approved by the Commission.
         i.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance.
      5.   Restrictions: In granting any special use, the commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions, bonds and safeguards in conformity with this
title. Violations of such conditions, bonds or safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the special use is granted, shall be deemed a violation
of this title.
      6.   Public Hearing: Upon receipt of the application for a special use,
the commission shall hold a public hearing before the commission in which
interested persons shall have the opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen
(15) days prior to the hearing, notice of the time and place and a summary of
the proposal shall be published in the official newspaper or paper of general
circulation within the jurisdiction of the city. Notice may also be made
available to other newspapers, radio and television stations serving the
jurisdiction for use as a public service announcement. Written notice shall
also be provided to property owners within three hundred feet (300') of the
parcel.
      7.   Action By The Commission: Within thirty (30) days after the public
hearing, the commission shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
application as presented. If the application is approved or approved with
modifications, the commission shall direct the administrator to issue a special
use permit listing the specific conditions specified by the commission for
approval.
Upon granting of a special use permit, conditions may be attached to a special
use permit including, but not limited to, the following:

         f.   Requiring the provision for on site or off site public facilities
or services.
         g.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally
required in this title.
Prior to granting a special use permit, the commission may request studies from
the planning staff or public agencies concerning social, economic, fiscal and
environmental effects of the proposed special use. A special use permit shall
not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other such
special use permits.
      8.   Specifications For Granting Or Denying Application: Upon granting or
denying an application the commission shall specify:
         a.   The regulations and standards used in evaluating the application.
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial.
         c.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
The applicant or any affected person, who appeared in person or in writing
before the commission may appeal the decision of the commission to the council,
provided a written appeal is submitted to the council within fifteen (15) days
from the commission's action.
      9.   Notification To Applicant: Within ten (10) days after a decision has
been rendered the administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice
of the action on the request.
      10.   Transfer, Review And Discontinuance Of Special Use Permits:
         a.   A special use permit is not transferable from one parcel of land
to another, but may be transferable from one owner to another, provided all
conditions for the special use continue to be met and the special use permit so
provides.
         b.   Special use permits granted for in-home daycare services and home
occupations are not transferable from one owner to another, nor from one parcel
of land to another.
         c.   Special uses which have not been established within one year of
the date of issuance of the special use permit, may be reviewed by the
commission to determine if the facts and circumstances have changed; the
commission may call for a new special use permit application.
         d.   A special use, which has been discontinued for a period of one
year, shall not be reestablished without a new special use permit.
         e.   Special use permits granted for dog kennels shall be reviewed
annually by the commission no later than January 31 of each year to determine
whether the holder of the special use permit is in compliance with this
section, section
6.08.070 of this code and the conditions of said special use permit. If the
commission finds the holder is not in compliance, the special use permit may be
amended or revoked by the commission.
      11.   Appeal To The Council: Upon receipt of an appeal from the action of
the commission, the council shall set a hearing date, under the same provisions
as the commission hearing, to consider all information, testimony and the
commission's minutes of the public hearing to reach a decision to uphold
conditionally, uphold or overrule the decision of the commission.
      12.   Conditional Approval: If a special use permit is approved on
condition that certain improvements be made to the subject property, no permit
shall be issued until the applicant has provided proof that the conditions have
been complied with. If the applicant fails to provide proof of compliance
within six (6) months of approval, the special use permit shall be void.
   C.   Revocation Of Zoning Permits:
      1.   Any privilege, permit or license, hereinafter called permit, granted
pursuant to this title, including any permit granted prior to the passage of
this section, and with the exception of rezone requests, may be revoked for any
of the following reasons:
         a.   When a significant change in the use that does adversely impact
neighboring developments occurs.
         b.   For violation of supplementary conditions, safeguards and/or
restrictions imposed by the city council or the planning and zoning commission
at the time the permit was granted.
         c.   Use of a zoning permit or certificate for a use other than the
use of which said permit or certificate was issued.

permit.
         b.   By adoption of a motion by the council for revocation of the

hearing shall be held within forty five (45) days of the filing of a petition
for revocation or the passage of a motion initiating revocation proceedings.
      5.   The decision of the zoning body hearing a revocation proceeding
shall be based on the record. If said zoning body finds substantial evidence on
the record that continuance of the use in question will result in a significant
adverse impact on the surrounding developments or other affected parties, and
that the permit holder is unable or unwilling to alleviate the adversity, or,
if said zoning body finds substantial evidence on the record that conditions,
safeguards or restrictions imposed by the commission or council have been
violated, the zoning body may revoke the permit in question.
      6.   A permit that has been revoked may be reinstated only by reapplying
for said permit.
      7.   Within ten (10) days after a decision has been rendered, the

17.14.035: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
In accordance with the notice and hearing procedures for zoning boundary
changes in sections
17.14.050 through
17.14.090 of this chapter (including notice that a development agreement is
part of the application for zoning map amendment), a property owner or
developer may request, or the city may require, that an application for zoning
map amendment or rezone be processed in conjunction with the execution of a
development agreement. The development agreement will allow a change in the
zoning for a specific project, with a specific use, to be developed on property
in an area which may not be appropriate for all uses permitted outright or
conditionally within the proposed zone. Approval of the development agreement,
pursuant to this section, would permit the proposed use, with conditions,
within the proposed zone.
Such conditional commitments in development agreements are in addition to the
regulations provided for in the zoning district by this title, and are
established to ensure compatibility of the resulting land use with the
surrounding area. The use of a PUD permit process shall be the only means
whereby the city of Kimberly will/shall entertain allowing uses in a zone not
normally allowed therein; and a development agreement does not provide an
exception.
   A.   Creation And Form: A request to enter into a development agreement
shall be in a form developed by the planning and zoning coordinator and
approved by the city council. The development agreement shall, as a condition
of consideration by the planning and zoning commission or city council, include
at a minimum the following:
      1.   A legal description of the subject property;
      2.   A list of the use(s) to be allowed;
      3.   Identification of development standards that shall be required under
the development agreement;
      4.   The planned implementation of improvements with a construction and
completion schedule;
      5.   Provisions for any dedication or reservation of all applicable land;
      6.   A site map showing all boundaries, the locations for permitted use
(s), land area in acres, and natural features including water bodies and any
other relevant features;
      7.   A provision that the property owner/developer acknowledges and
agrees that failure to comply with the terms of the agreement shall result in a
reversion of the zoning of the real property to the zoning existing immediately
prior to the agreement, pursuant to the procedure set forth in Idaho Code
section 67-6511A and this section;
      8.   A provision for the use of a financial guarantee for project
completion if the proposal is developed in phases;
      9.   A provision specifying that unless modified or terminated by the
city council, pursuant to subsection D of this section, the development
agreement and all conditions, terms, duties and obligations included in said
development agreement are binding on the owner of the property, each subsequent
property owner and every person(s) acquiring interest in said property;
      10.   Any other conditions attached to the project through the public
hearing process.
   B.   Safeguards: The following safeguards shall be applied:
      1.   A development agreement shall not prevent the city in subsequent
actions related to the property from applying new rules, regulations or
policies that do not conflict with commitments applicable to the property as
set forth within any duly executed development agreement.
      2.   If the owner or developer fails to comply with a conditional
commitment in a development agreement after completion of construction, the
city may deal with the violation through all penalty provisions allowed under
city ordinances and state law.
      3.   When a commitment is required to be satisfied prior to completion of
construction, and it is not so satisfied, construction may be halted until
compliance is established.
   C.   Recording: Agreements shall take effect and shall be recorded in the
Twin Falls County recorder's office upon the adoption of the ordinance
establishing the zoning map amendment by the city council or Twin Falls County
board of commissioners if the property is in the area of impact. Should a
development agreement be terminated by the city, and the zoning designation
upon which the use is based be reversed, a document recording such termination
and zoning reversal shall also be recorded by the city in the Twin Falls County
recorder's office. An agreement shall be binding on the owner of the parcel,
each subsequent owner, and each other person acquiring an interest in the
parcel.
   D.   Modification, Enforcement, And Termination Of Commitments: A
development agreement may be modified by request of an applicant or the city
only after receiving a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission and
by an approval vote of the city council after compliance with the notice and
hearing provisions for zoning boundary changes in sections
17.14.050 through
17.14.090 of this chapter. The following are circumstances where a modification
may be considered:
      1.   A change to any of the terms or conditions of the original
development agreement is proposed; and/or
      2.   A substantial change to any established positioning or exterior
appearance of any structure over two hundred (200) square feet in area is
proposed; and/or
      3.   A substantial change in infrastructure from what was agreed upon.
A development agreement may be terminated by the city, and the zoning
designation granted by the agreement reversed to the zoning that was in effect
on the pertinent site before the agreement was executed, upon the failure of
the owner, developer, or each subsequent owner or each person acquiring an
interest in the subject parcel, to comply with the commitments contained in the
development agreement within two (2) years of approval by the city council or
Twin Falls County board of commissioners. Exception: The failure to begin or
complete site development of all or a portion of a project proposed under a
development agreement does not necessarily have to serve as impetus to claim
that an owner or developer has failed to comply with their commitments
contained in their respective development agreement. Rather, such failure to
begin or complete site development of all or a portion of a project proposed
under a development agreement, shall serve as impetus to consider termination
of an agreement and reversion of zoning. A hearing for termination may be
convened by the city council after complying with the same notice and hearing
provisions required for a zoning boundary change and any relevant termination
terms of the pertinent agreement. During the hearing, the council may vote to
take no action, cause modification of the agreement if the applicant is
willing, or terminate the agreement.
The two (2) year period of time for compliance with the commitments contained
in the development agreement may be extended by the city for just cause, and
upon application for such by the owner, after complying with the notice and
hearing provisions required for a zoning boundary change.
In accordance with state law, the establishment of a development agreement and
the written commitments contained therein shall provide written consent for the
city council to change the zoning of the subject property to its prior
designation upon failure of an applicant to comply with the conditions imposed
by their agreement. (Ord. 619, 2014)
17.14.040: COMMISSION ACTION:

17.18.010: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The city council of the city of Kimberly, Twin Falls County, Idaho, finds that
   A.   Based on the city of Kimberly comprehensive plan adopted by the city
pursuant to chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general
governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, it is necessary that the city's public improvement plan
for:
      1.   Police;
      2.   Parks and recreation;
      3.   Library-community education;
      4.   Streets-public works;
      5.   Administration future updates of this plan - fiber optic
communication upgrades, be expanded and improved to accommodate new development
within the city.
Throughout this chapter, the system improvements for these four (5) types of
public improvement plan are sometimes collectively referred to as the "city
capital improvement plan.
   B.   The city has formed the development impact fee advisory committee
required by Idaho Code section 67.8205, and that committee has performed the
duties required of it pursuant to such statute. The city intends that the
committee continue to exist and to perform those duties identified in Idaho
Code section 67.8205 that occur following the adoption of development impact
fees.
   C.   New residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose
increasing and excessive demands upon city capital improvement plan.
   D.   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential
development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary
improvements of these city capital improvement plan to accommodate new
development.
   E.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the city to provide and expand city capital improvement plan to
serve new development.
   F.   The city has planned for the improvement of the city capital
improvement plan of the city of Kimberly comprehensive plan.
   G.   Chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code (the Idaho development impact
fee act) authorizes the city to adopt a development impact fee system to
offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to
the city capital improvement plan caused by new development in the city.
   H.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would
promote the purposes set forth in the Idaho development impact fee act, in that
it would:
      1.   Ensure that adequate public improvement plan are available to serve
new growth and development;
      2.   Promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments may require that those who benefit from
new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public
improvement plan needed to serve new growth and development;
      3.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are
required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public
improvement plan needed to serve new growth and development; and
      4.   Prevent duplicate and ad hoc development requirements.
   I.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable
the city to accommodate new development, and would assist the city to implement
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
   J.   In order to implement an equitable development impact fee system for
the city capital improvement plan, the city engaged their City Administrator,
P&Z administrator, City Engineer-Public Works Director, Legal Counsel, Police
Chief, City Clerk, Librarian and Legal Counsel to prepare an impact fee study
for these types of improvements. The resulting document is titled “City of
Kimberly, ID Development Impact Fee Study,” dated February 22, 2022 is hereby
incorporated by reference.
   K.   The methodology used in preparing the development impact fee study,
when applied through this chapter, complies with all applicable provisions of
Idaho law, including those set forth in Idaho statutes sections 67.8204(2),
67.8204(16), 67.8204(23), 67.8207 and 67.8209. The incorporation of the
development impact fee study by reference satisfies the requirement in Idaho
statutes section 67.8204(16) for a detailed description of the methodology by
which the development impact fees were calculated, and the requirement in Idaho
Code section 67.8204(24) for a description of acceptable levels of service for
system improvements.
   L.   The development impact fee study contains the capital improvements
element of the city of Kimberly comprehensive plan, and such element has been
prepared in conformance with the requirements of chapters 65 and 82 of title 67
of the Idaho Code.
   M.   The development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies
and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on
the city capital improvement plan, and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such
improvement plan created by new development.
   N.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the development impact fee study was
based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
In addition, the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation
methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will
be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns
and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements,
including taxes, assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers.
   O.   The development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the
development impact fee study, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for city capital improvement plan to serve new development that
will pay the development impact fees.
   P.   The improvement plan for parks and recreation, streets, police,
library, and administration included in the calculation of fees in the
development impact fee study will benefit all new residential and
nonresidential development throughout the city, and it is therefore appropriate
to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of
calculating, collecting, and spending the development impact fees collected
from residential and nonresidential development.
   Q.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   R.   This chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
new development will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the
costs incurred by the city to acquire/construct improvements for city capital
improvement plan in ways that benefit the development for which each
development impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the
development impact fee is paid, and in conformance with Idaho Code section
67.8210.
   S.   This chapter creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital improvement plan,
or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements, or to pay for routine
operation or maintenance of those improvement plan.
   T.   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67.8204(19).
   U.   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of chapter
82, title 67, Idaho Code, concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord.
671, 2023)
17.18.020: AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY:
   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city's general police power,
the authority granted to the city pursuant to chapters 65 and 82, title 67,
Idaho Code, and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho.
   B.   This chapter shall apply to all areas of the city. (Ord. 671, 2023)
17.18.030: INTENT:
   A.   This chapter is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement,
the City of Kimberly comprehensive plan, and particularly the capital
improvements element of that plan.
   B.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements to City capital improvement
plan; to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of
improvements to such improvement plan required to accommodate new development;
and to ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for
improvements to City capital improvement plan that benefit such new
development.
   C.   It is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital improvement
plan to new development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code.
   D.   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
City capital improvement plan created by such new development.
   E.   It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from any
development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be commingled
with monies from a different impact fee account, or ever be used for a
development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was
paid, or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the City capital
improvement plan or ever be used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain, or operate
any City facility. (Ord. 671, 2023)

   A.   Fee Obligation
      1.   After the effective date hereof, any person who commences any impact
generating land development, except those exempted pursuant to subsection (B)
of this section, shall be obligated to pay development impact fees upon
commencement of such activity. The amount of the development impact fees shall
be determined in accordance with this chapter.
      2.   If the fee payer is applying for an extension of a permit issued
previously, then the development impact fees required to be paid shall be the
net increase between the development impact fees applicable at the time of the
current permit application and any development impact fees previously paid
pursuant to this chapter to finance similar types of system improvements to
accommodate demands created by the same development.
      3.   If the fee payer is applying for a permit to allow a change of use
or for the expansion, redevelopment, or modification of an existing
development, the development impact fees required to be paid shall be based on
the net increase in the development impact fees for the new use as compared to
the previous use.
   B.   Exemptions The following types of development shall be exempted from
payment of the development impact fees. Any claim for exemption shall be made
no later than the time when the applicant applies for the first building permit
for the proposed development that creates the obligation to pay the development
impact fees, and any claim for exemption not made at or before that time shall
have been waived. The P & Z Administrator or a designee shall determine the
validity of any claim for exemption pursuant to the criteria set forth below.
      1.   Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure that was
destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, providing the structure is rebuilt and
ready for occupancy within two (2) years of its destruction;
      2.   Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not increase the
number of service units;
      3.   Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with

increase the number of service units;
      5.   Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot;
      6.   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such
as tennis courts or clubhouses, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the
use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements;
      7.   The installation of a modular building, manufactured home, or
recreational vehicle if the fee payer can demonstrate by documentation such as
utility bills and tax records that either:
         a.   A modular building, manufactured home, or recreational vehicle
was legally in place on the lot or space prior to the effective date hereof; or
         b.   A development impact fee has been paid previously for the
installation of a modular building, manufactured home or recreational vehicle
on that same lot or space;
      8.   Projects for which a development impact fee for each type of public
facility covered by this chapter has previously been paid in an amount that
equals or exceeds the development impact fee that would be required by this
chapter;
      9.   Projects built by the Federal government or the State government;
and
      10.   Projects which meet all of the following criteria may apply for an
individualized assessment pursuant to subsection C4 of this section, except
that the applicant may simply rely on the documented project history rather
than retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment;
         a.   A development agreement was entered into by the project developer
and the City setting forth the entitlements and obligations of the developer,
which agreement was approved by the City Council prior to February 22, 2022;

that would be collected under this chapter.
   C.   Fee Table and Calculation Of Amount Of Development Impact Fees
      1.   Fee Table:
Police fees
        Residential            $484.00      per dwelling unit
                               Retail $0.22
        Nonresidential         Office $0.22 per square foot
                               LI $0.22
Police vehicles Residential    $85.00       per dwelling unit
                               Retail $0.22
Police vehicles Nonresidential Office $0.22 per square foot
                               LI $0.22

        Nonresidential         n/a
Street fees
        Single family          $270.00      per dwelling unit
        Retail                 $0.94        per square foot

Library Residential            $70.00       per dwelling unit
 
This fee schedule shall be in effect thirty (30) days after the publication of
this Ordinance.
On January 1, 2023, and on January 1 of each year thereafter in which an impact
fee is in effect, the amount of the impact fee shall be automatically adjusted
to account for year over year inflation increases in the cost of providing
police, admin., parks and recreation, and street public improvement plan to
serve new development utilizing the latest available municipal cost index as
published by “American Cities and County Magazine.” Nothing herein shall
prevent the city from electing to maintain a then existing police, admin.,
library, parks and recreation, and street impact fee or from electing to waive
the inflation adjustment for any given fiscal year, or years. Any such action
to determine an inflation factor shall be by city council resolution.
      2.   Levels Of Service: Current data used to determine levels of service
are as follows:
         a.   02-21-22, Police level of service - Kimberly city limits - 8.35
officers, 1 part time records clerk - 2020 Census population = 4,626 officers =
8.35 officers per 554 population.
         b.   Parks and recreation level of service = 1 part time mower and 1
maintenance employee for 8.58 acres of park land. Developed park recreation
open space = 8.58 acres per 539 population.
         c.   City Street level of service from the 2019 Master Transportation
Plan depicts a level of service D on hwy. 30 near the 30-Polk intersection and
South Main-Elementary school access and service level B and C on remaining
arterials and collectors at the P.M. peak period.
      3.   Using The Fee Table: Development impact fees shall be calculated
using the fee table above (or as subsequently amended by Council per automatic
adjustments criteria above) unless a) the fee payer requests an individualized
assessment pursuant to subsection (C) 4 of this section, or b) the City
designates the proposed development as a development of extraordinary impact in
writing to the fee payer, in which case the provisions of subsection (C)5 of
this section shall apply.
         a.   Any person who commences any new impact generating land
development, except those exempted pursuant to this chapter, or those preparing
an individual assessment pursuant to this chapter, shall pay all development
impact fees applicable to the proposed development, as determined by the fee
table. Persons choosing to pay applicable development impact fees pursuant to
the fee table shall be deemed to have made a full and complete payment of the
project's proportionate share of City capital improvement plan costs for system
improvements, except as noted in subsection
17.18.090 of this chapter.
         b.   If the proposed development is of a type not listed in the fee
table, then the City shall apply the development impact fees applicable to the
most nearly comparable type of land use listed in the fee table. The
determination as to which type of development is most nearly comparable to the
proposed development shall be made by referring to traffic generation rates for
land uses published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and by
identifying that land use listed in the fee table whose traffic generation
rates are most comparable to the proposed land use. If no traffic generation
rate for the proposed land use appears in a publication of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, or if it is not possible to determine which land use
listed in the fee table has the most comparable traffic generation rates, then
the most nearly comparable land use shall be determined by the P & Z
Administrator based on comparison of other characteristics of the proposed land
use (including employment or occupancy, the size of the facility, and the
amount of parking to be provided) with the characteristics of those land uses
listed in the fee table.
         c.   If the proposed development includes a mix of those uses listed
in the fee table, then the development impact fees shall be determined by
adding up the development impact fees that would be payable for each use as if
it were a freestanding use pursuant to the fee table. For example, development
impact fees for a church without ancillary improvement plan will be determined
through the process in subsection (C)3.b of this section; but development
impact fees for a church with a daycare center shall be established by adding
1) fees determined through the process in subsection (C)3.b. of this section
for the church itself, and 2) fees identified in the fee table for the daycare
portion of the facility.
         d.   If the fee payer requests that the city calculate the amount of
development impact fees due pursuant to the fee table, the city shall notify
the fee payer of such amount within thirty (30) days after receipt of that
request.
      4.   Using An Individual Assessment:
         a.   In lieu of calculating the amount(s) of development impact fees
by reference to the fee table, a fee payer may request that the amount of the
required development impact fee be determined through an individual assessment
for the proposed development. The individual assessment process shall permit
consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by
the fee payer to adjust the amount of the fee. If a fee payer requests the use
of an individual assessment, the fee payer shall be responsible for retaining a
qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment that complies with
the requirements of this chapter, at the fee payer's expense. The fee payer
shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the
resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its proportionate
share of the cost of city capital improvements, based on the city's adopted
levels of service, than the development impact fees that would otherwise be due
pursuant to the fee table. The city may hire a professional consultant to
review any independent impact fee calculation study on behalf of the city, and
may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
         b.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same level of
service standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the
development impact fee study, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost)
methodology, and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions
used.
         c.   An application for an individual assessment may be submitted at
any time that the number of dwelling units in the proposed development and the
types and amounts of development in each nonresidential category identified in
the fee table is known. The city shall issue a decision within thirty (30) days
following receipt of a completed application for individual assessment and
supporting information from the applicant, so as not to unreasonably delay
subsequent applications for or issuance of building permits.
         d.   Each individual assessment shall be submitted to the P & Z
Administrator or a designee, and may be accepted, rejected, or accepted with
modifications by the P & Z Administrator or a designee as the basis for
calculating development impact fees. The criteria for acceptance, rejection, or
acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is a
more accurate measure of demand for the city capital improvements element(s)
created by the proposed development, or the costs of those improvement plan,
than the applicable fee shown in the fee table.
         e.   The decision by the P & Z Administrator or designee on an
application for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the
calculation of the impact fee, shall specify the system improvement(s) for
which the impact fee is intended to be used, and shall include an explanation
of those factors identified in Idaho Code section 67.8207.
         f.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the P & Z Administrator or a designee then the development
impact fees due under this chapter for such development shall be calculated
according to such individual assessment.
      5.   Extraordinary Impacts:
         a.   If the city determines that a proposed development generates
extraordinary impacts that will result in extraordinary costs, the city will
notify the fee payer of such determination within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a request for a certification pursuant to subsection D of this
section or a request for a building permit or development approval, whichever
occurs first. Such notice shall include a statement that the potential impacts
of such development on system improvements are not adequately addressed by the
development impact fee study, and that a supplemental study at the fee payer's
expense will be required.
         b.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of extraordinary
impacts include, but are not limited to 1) an indication that traffic
generation from the proposed development or activity will exceed those typical
for a facility or activity of its type, 2) an indication that employment
generated by the development or activity will exceed those typical for a
facility or activity of its type, 3) an indication the assumptions used in the
development impact fee study underestimate the level of activity or impact on
city capital improvement plan from the proposed development or activity, or 4)
an indication that levels of calls for law enforcement, fire, or emergency
services from developments or activities owned or operated by the fee payer or
its agents exceed the assumptions used in the development impact fee study.
         c.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a
development with extraordinary impacts, the city shall meet with the fee payer
to discuss whether the fee payer wants to 1) pay for the supplemental study
necessary to determine the system improvement costs related to the proposed
development, or 2) modify the proposal to avoid generating extraordinary
impacts, or 3) withdraw the application for certification, building permit, or
development approval.
         d.   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study
required to document the proposed development's proportionate share of system
improvement costs, then the city and the fee payer shall jointly select an
individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study, the fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the fee payer agrees to a longer time.
         e.   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to 1)
pay the proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the
supplemental study, or 2) modify the proposed development to reduce such costs,
or 3) withdraw the application. If the fee payer agrees to pay the system
improvement costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be
reduced to writing between the city and the fee payer prior to review and
consideration of any application for any development approval or building
permit related to the proposed development.
         f.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the
proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve development
that results in an extraordinary impact.
   D.   Certification After the development impact fees due for a proposed
development have been calculated pursuant to the fee table or the individual
assessment, the fee payer may request the P & Z Administrator or a designee for
a certification of the amount of development impact fees due for that
development. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the P & Z
Administrator or a designee shall issue a written certification of the amount
of development impact fees due for the proposed development. Such certification
shall establish the development impact fee so long as there is no material
change to the particular project as identified in the individual assessment
application, or the impact fee schedule set forth in the fee table. The
certification shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee
including an explanation of factors considered under Idaho Code section 67.8207
and shall also specify the system improvement(s) for which the development
impact fee is intended to be used.
   E.   Payment Of Fees:
      1.   All development impact fees due shall be paid to the city at the
following times.
         a.   If a building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time such permit is issued;
         b.   If no building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time that construction commences; or
         c.   At such other time as the applicant and the city have agreed to
in writing, pursuant to applicable Idaho law.
      2.   All monies paid by a fee payer pursuant to the fee table shall be
identified as development impact fees and shall be promptly deposited in the
appropriate account(s) described in section
17.18.070 of this chapter.
      3.   A fee payer may pay a development impact fee under protest in order
to avoid delay in the issuance of a building permit or development approval. A
fee payer making a payment under protest shall not be estopped from exercising
the right of appeal provided in section
17.18.100 of this chapter, nor shall such fee payer be estopped from receiving
a refund of any amount deemed to have been illegally collected. (Ord. 671,

671, 2022)
17.18.090: CREDITS AGAINST DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Credits To Be Issued When a developer, or their predecessor in title or
interest, has constructed system improvements of the same category as a city
capital improvements element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards
the completion of system improvements of the same category as a city capital
improvements element, and the city has accepted such construction,
contribution, or dedication, the city shall issue a credit against the
development impact fees otherwise due for the same city capital improvements
element in connection with the proposed development, as set forth in this
section. Credit shall be issued regardless of whether the contribution or
dedication to system improvements was required by the city as a condition of
development approval or was offered by the developer and accepted by the city
in writing, and regardless of whether the contribution or dedication was
contributed by the developer or by a local improvement district controlled by
the developer.
   B.   Limitations Credits against development impact fees shall not be given
for:
      1.   Project improvements; or
      2.   Any construction, contribution, or dedication not agreed to in
writing by the city prior to commencement of the construction, contribution, or
dedication.
Credits issued for one city capital improvements element may not be used to
reduce development impact fees due for a different capital improvements
element. No credits shall be issued for system improvements contributed or
dedicated prior to the effective date hereof.
   C.   Valuation Of Credit At Present Value:
      1.   Land Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the fee
payer's option, be valued at the present value of:
         a.   One hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the county assessor; or
         b.   That fair market value established by a private appraiser
acceptable to the city in an appraisal paid for by the fee payer.
In the event that city and the fee payer cannot agree upon an appraiser, either
may petition the district court for appointment of an appraiser.
      2.   Improvements Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall be valued by the city at the present value of such
improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the fee payer to the city. The city
shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information submitted,
or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on
alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to the city as a more
accurate measure of the value of the offered system improvements to the city.
   D.   When Credits Become Effective
      1.   Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the city in a form acceptable to the city at no
cost to the city, and has been accepted by the city. When such conditions have
been met, the city shall note that fact in its records. Upon request of the fee
payer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
      2.   Approved credits for acquisition or construction of system
improvements shall generally become effective when:
         a.   All required construction has been completed and has been
accepted by the city;
         b.   A suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and
approved by the city; and
         c.   All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the city and the State of Idaho.
Approved credits for the construction of system improvements may become
effective at an earlier date if the fee payer posts security in the form of a
performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement and the
amount and terms of such security are accepted by the P & Z Administrator or a
designee. At a minimum, such security must be in the amount of the approved
credit or an amount determined to be adequate to allow the city to construct
the system improvements for which the credit was given, whichever is higher.
When such conditions have been met, the city shall note that fact in its
records. Upon request of the fee payer, the city shall issue a letter stating
the amount of credit available.
   E.   Application Procedures
      1.   In order to obtain a credit against development impact fees
otherwise due, a fee payer shall submit a written offer to dedicate to the P &
Z Administrator or a designee for specific parcels of qualifying land or a
written offer to contribute or construct specific system improvements to the
city capital improvement plan in accordance with all applicable state or city
design and construction standards, and shall specifically request a credit
against the type of development impact fees for which the land dedication or
system improvement is offered. No request for a credit against development
impact fees shall be accepted unless a written offer to dedicate, contribute,
or construct has previously been approved in writing by the city.
      2.   After receipt of the request for credit, the P & Z Administrator or
a designee shall review the request and determine whether the land or system
improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing city capital
improvement plan by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If the
P & Z Administrator or a designee determines that the offered credit satisfies
that criterion, then the credit shall be issued. The city shall complete its
review and determination of an application for credit within thirty (30) days
after receipt of an application for credit.
   F.   Transferability Of Credit: A credit may only be transferred by the fee
payer that has received the credit to a successor in interest pursuant to the
terms of this chapter. The credit may be used only to offset development impact
fees for the same city capital improvements element for which the credit was
issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly
identifying which credits issued under this chapter are being transferred, the
dollar amount of the credit being transferred, and the city capital
improvements element for which the credit was issued. The instrument of
transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee, and a copy of
the document shall be delivered to the P & Z Administrator or a designee for
documentation of the change in ownership before it shall become effective.
   G.   Accounting Of Credits: Each time a request to use approved credits is
presented to the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the development
impact fees for the type of fee for which the credit is provided, and shall
note in the city's records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request
of the fee payer or successor in interest to whom the credit was issued, the
city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit remaining.
   H.   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due: If the credit due to a fee payer
pursuant to subsections A through G of this section exceeds the development
impact fee that would otherwise be due from the fee payer pursuant to section
17.18.90 of this chapter (whether calculated through the fee table in section
17.18.90 of this chapter or through an independent assessment), the fee payer
may choose to receive such credit in the form of either 1) a credit against
future development impact fees due for the same capital improvements element,
or 2) a reimbursement from development impact fees paid by future development
that impacts the system improvements contributed or dedicated by the fee payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the fee payer, the city shall be
under no obligation to use any city funds, other than development impact fees
paid by other development for the same city capital improvements element, to
reimburse the fee payer for any credit in excess of development impact fees
due.
   I.   Written Agreement Required: If credit or reimbursement is due to the
fee payer pursuant to this section, the city shall enter into a written
agreement with the fee payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the system improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount,
time and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years. (Ord. 671, 2022)
17.18.100: APPEALS AND MEDIATION:
Disputes regarding decisions made in the application of this chapter shall be
resolved through appeal to the city council, or through mediation, as set forth
below
   A.   Right To Appeal
      1.   Any fee payer that is or may be obligated to pay a development
impact fee, or that claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, or
credit under this chapter, and who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the
P & Z Administrator or a designee in applying this chapter, shall first request
that the P & Z Administrator reconsider the decision. A fee payer requesting
reconsideration shall state in writing to the P & Z Administrator the reasons
why the fee payer believes the decision to be in error. The P & Z Administrator
shall issue a written decision confirming or modifying the decision within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of a written request for reconsideration.
      2.   Any fee payer that is dissatisfied with the decision of the P & Z
Administrator upon reconsideration pursuant to subsection A1 of this section,
may appeal such decision to the city council. The fee payer shall have the
burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the decision was in
error.
      3.   In order to pursue the appeal described in subsection A2 of this
section, the fee payer shall file a written notice of the appeal with the P & Z
Administrator or a designee within thirty (30) days after the date of the
reconsideration, or the date on which the fee payer submitted a payment of
development impact fees under protest, whichever is later. Such written
application shall include a statement describing why the fee payer believes
that the decision was in error, together with copies of any documents that the
fee payer believes support the claim.
      4.   The city council shall hear the appeal within sixty (60) days after
receipt of a written notice of appeal. The fee payer shall have a right to be
present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The P & Z
Administrator or designee who made the decision under appeal shall likewise
have the right to be present and to present evidence in support of the
decision. The criteria to be used by the city council in considering the appeal
shall be whether: a) the decision or interpretation made by the P & Z
Administrator after reconsideration, or b) the alternative decision or
interpretation offered by the fee payer more accurately reflects the
proportionate share of the costs of system improvements to city capital
improvement plan necessary to serve new development and whether this chapter
has been correctly applied. The city council shall issue a decision upholding,
reversing, or modifying the decision being appealed within thirty (30) days
after hearing the appeal.
   B.   Mediation:
      1.   Any fee payer that has a disagreement with the city regarding a
development impact fee that is or may be due for a proposed development
pursuant to this chapter, may enter into a voluntary agreement with the city to
subject the disagreement to mediation by a qualified independent party
acceptable to both the fee payer and the city.
      2.   Mediation may take place at any time following the filing of a
timely appeal pursuant to this section, or as an alternative to such appeal,
provided that the request for mediation is filed no later than the last date on
which a timely appeal could be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section.
      3.   Participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies provided for in subsection A of this section.
      4.   If mediation is requested, any related mediation costs shall be
shared equally by the fee payer and the city, and a written agreement regarding
the payment of such costs shall be executed prior to the commencement of
mediation.
      5.   In the event that mediation does not resolve the issues between the
parties, the fee payer retains all rights to seek relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 671, 2022)
17.18.200: ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION:
When any development impact fee is due pursuant to the terms of this chapter,
or pursuant to the terms of any written agreement between a fee payer and the
city authorized by this chapter, and such fee has not been paid in a timely
manner, the city may exercise any or all of the following powers, in any
combination, to enforce the collection of the fee:
   A.   The city may withhold building permits or other development approvals
related to the development for which the fee is due until all development
impact fees due have been paid.
   B.   The city may withhold utility services from the development for which
the fee is due until all development impact fees due have been paid.
   C.   The city may add to the amount of the fee interest at the legal rate
provided for in Idaho Code section 28.22.18.004 from the date on which the fee
was due.
   D.   The city may impose liens for failure to timely pay a development
impact fee following procedures contained in chapter 5, title 45, Idaho Code.
(Ord. 671, 2022)
17.18.300: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any additional
right to develop real property or diminish the power of the city in regulating
the orderly development of real property.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve any
development request that may reasonably be expected to reduce levels of service
below minimum acceptable levels established in the development impact fee
study.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict or diminish the power of the
city:
      1.   To impose reasonable conditions on the annexation of any property to
the city in accordance with Idaho Code, including conditions for recovery of
project or system improvement costs required as a result of such voluntary
annexation, or
      2.   To negotiate and execute development agreements that may impose
additional conditions on development, including the recovery of project or
system improvement costs, either in connection with a proposed annexation or in
connection with any other development within the city.
   D.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a
project for which a complete application for a building permit has been
received by the city prior to the effective date hereof shall not be subject to
the development impact fees imposed by this chapter. If the resulting building
permit is later revised or replaced after the effective date hereof, and the
new building permit reflects a development density, intensity, or number of
units more than ten percent (10%) higher than that reflected in the original
building permit, then development impact fees may be charged on the difference
in density, intensity, or number of units between the original and the revised
or replacement building permit.
   E.   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the city from requiring fee
payer or an applicant for a development approval or building permit to
construct reasonable project improvements required to serve the applicant's
project, provided that such request does not duplicate a system improvement in
a category for which costs were included in the development impact fee study.
   F.   Any monies, including any accrued interest not assigned to specific
system improvements within such capital improvements program and not expended
pursuant to section
17.18.070 of this chapter or refunded pursuant to section
17.18.070 of this chapter shall be retained in the same account until the next
fiscal year.
   G.   The city shall be entitled to collect and retain a surcharge on each
development impact fee collected in order to recoup that portion of the cost of
preparing the capital improvements plan that is attributable to determining the
development impact. Such surcharge does not exceed each development's
proportionate share of the cost of preparing the plan.
   H.   If the city discovers an error in the development impact fee study that
results in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share of system
improvement costs on any proposed development, the city shall 1) adjust the
development impact fee to collect no more than a proportionate share or 2)
discontinue the collection of any development impact fees until the error is
corrected by ordinance.
   I.   If development impact fees are calculated and paid based on a mistake
or misrepresentation, they shall be recalculated. Any amounts overpaid by a fee
payer shall be refunded by the city within thirty (30) days after the City's
acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the legal rate provided
for in Idaho Code section 28.22.18.004 from the date on which the fee was paid.
Any amounts underpaid by the fee payer shall be paid to the City within thirty
(30) days after the City's acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest
at the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28.22.18.004 from the date
on which the fee was paid. In the case of an underpayment to the City, the City
may withhold issuance of building permits or development approvals for the
project for which the development impact fee was paid until such underpayment
is corrected, and if amounts owed to the City are not paid within such thirty
(30) day period, the City may also repeal any building permits or development
approvals issued in reliance on the previous payment of such development impact
fee and refund such fee to the fee payer.
   J.   The City Council shall consider the Development Impact Fee Advisory
Committee's recommended revision(s) to this chapter at least once every twelve
(12) months. The committee's recommendations and the City Council's actions are
intended to ensure that the benefits to a fee-paying development are equitable,
in that the fee charged to the development shall not exceed a proportionate
share of the costs of system improvements, and the procedures for administering
development impact fees remain efficient.
   K.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit
private agreements between developers, the City, the Idaho Transportation
Department, and/or other governmental entities in regard to the construction or
installation of system improvements or providing for credits or reimbursements
for system improvement costs incurred by a developer or fee payer, including
interproject transfers of credits, or providing for reimbursement for project
improvements that are used or shared by more than one development project. If
it can be shown that a proposed development has a direct impact on a public
facility under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Transportation Department, then
the agreement shall include a provision for the allocation of development
impact fees collected from the developer or fee payer for the improvement of
the public facility by the Idaho Transportation Department.
   L.   Violation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor and shall be subject
to those remedies provided in section 1.18.07 of this Code. Knowingly
furnishing false information to any official of the City charged with the
administration of this chapter on any matter relating to the administration of

17.19.010: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The City of Kimberly and Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District as located
at 1559 Main St. North, Kimberly, Idaho, finds that:
   A.   Based on the city of Kimberly comprehensive plan adopted by the city
pursuant to chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general
governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, it is necessary that the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District's capital infrastructure plan for 1) Facilities, 2) Apparatus /
Vehicles, 3) Capital - Related Research, per Exhibit "A" and "B" attached
hereto, be expanded and improved to accommodate new development within the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District Boundaries as depicted in Exhibit "A" and
"B" attached hereto. Throughout this chapter, the system improvements for these
three (3) types of capital infrastructure improvements are sometimes
collectively referred to as the "Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
improvement plan.
   B.   Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District has formed their development
impact fee advisory committee required by Idaho Code section 67-8205, and that
committee has performed the duties required of it pursuant to such statute.
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District intends that the committee continue
to exist and to perform those duties identified in Idaho Code section 67-8205
that occur following the adoption of development impact fees.
   C.   New residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose
increasing and excessive demands upon Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
capital improvement plan.
   D.   The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential
development often do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary
improvements of these Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital
improvement plan to accommodate new development.
   E.   New development is expected to continue, and will place ever increasing
demands on the city to provide and expand Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District capital improvement plan to serve new development.
   F.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District has planned for the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan and the city of
Kimberly shall amend their Comprehensive Plan to include the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District boundaries per Exhibit "A" and "B" attached hereto.
   G.   Chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code (the Idaho development impact
fee act) authorizes the City of Kimberly to adopt Ordinances and Resolutions
for the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District, to adopt a development
impact fee system, to offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of
needed improvements to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital
improvement plan caused by new development in the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District.
   H.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would
promote the purposes set forth in the Idaho development impact fee act, in that
it would:
      1.   Ensure that adequate public improvement plan are available to serve
new growth and development;
      2.   Promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments may require that those who benefit from
new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public
improvement plan needed to serve new growth and development;
      3.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are
required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public
improvement plan needed to serve new growth and development; and
      4.   Prevent duplicate and ad hoc development requirements.
   I.   The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District to accommodate new development,
and would assist the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District to implement the
capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan district boundaries.
   J.   In order to implement an equitable development impact fee system for
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan, the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District, engaged their Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District development impact committee, Commission, Fire Chief,
Administration, Legal Counsel, Police Chief, Kimberly City Administrator,
Mayor, and City Council to prepare an impact fee study for these types of
improvements. The resulting document is titled "Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District of Kimberly, Id. Development Impact Fee Study, dated
"amended April 10, 2023" and is hereby incorporated by reference as Exhibit
"B".
   K.   The methodology used in preparing the development impact fee study,
when applied through this chapter, complies with all applicable provisions of
Idaho law, including those set forth in Idaho statutes sections 67-8204(2), 67-
8204(16), 67-8204(23), 67-8207 and 67-8209. The incorporation of the
development impact fee study by reference satisfies the requirement in Idaho
statutes section 67-8204(16) for a detailed description of the methodology by
which the development impact fees were calculated, and the requirement in Idaho
Code section 67-8204(24) for a description of acceptable levels of service for
system improvements.
   L.   The development impact fee study contains the capital improvements
element of the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District and incorporated into
the Kimberly comprehensive plan by reference of Ordinance No. 679, and such
element has been prepared in conformance with the requirements of chapters 65
and 82 of title 67 of the Idaho Code.
   M.   The development impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies
and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan, and
determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to
meet the demands for such improvement plan created by new development.
   N.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the development impact fee study was
based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
In addition, the development impact fee study uses a fee calculation
methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will
be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns
and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements,
including current tax assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers.
   O.   The development impact fees described in this chapter are based on the
development impact fee study, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement
plan to serve new development that will pay the development impact fees.
   P.   The improvement plan for Facilities, Apparatus / Vehicles and Capital -
Related Research, included in the calculation of fees in the development impact
fee study will benefit all new residential and nonresidential development
throughout the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District, and it is therefore
appropriate to treat all areas of the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
as a single service area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and spending
the development impact fees collected from residential and nonresidential
development.
   Q.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter
and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
   R.   This chapter creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
new development will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the
costs incurred by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District to acquire /
construct improvements for the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
capital improvement plan in ways that benefit the development for which each
development impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the
development impact fee is paid, and in conformance with Idaho Code section 67-
8210.
   S.   This chapter creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any capital improvement plan,
or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements, or to pay for routine
operation or maintenance of those improvement plan.
   T.   This chapter creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8204(19).
   U.   This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of chapter
82, title 67, Idaho Code, concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord.
679, 2023)
17.19.020: AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY:
   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Kimberly's general
police power, the authority granted to the City of Kimberly to adopt Ordinance
No. 679 to collect and disburse development impact fees to Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District pursuant to chapters 65 and 82, title 67, Idaho Code,
and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho.
   B.   This chapter shall apply to all areas of the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District. (Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.030: INTENT:
   A.   This chapter is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement,
by the creation and adoption of Ordinance No. 679, the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District, particularly the capital improvements element of that plan
and boundary map, incorporated in the Kimberly comprehensive plan as depicted
in Exhibit "A" and "B" attached hereto.
   B.   The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements to Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District capital improvement plan; to ensure that such proportionate
share does not exceed the cost of improvements to such improvement plan
required to accommodate new development; and to ensure that funds collected
from new development are actually used for improvements to Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District capital improvement plan that benefit such new
development.
   C.   It is the further intent of this chapter to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new capital improvement
plan to new development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by chapter 82, title 67 of the Idaho Code.
   D.   It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any money from any new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan created by
such new development.
   E.   The expenditure of development impact fees shall be prohibited except
in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-8210 and the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District's capital infrastructure plan for:
      1.   Facilities;
      2.   Apparatus/Vehicles;
      3.   Capital - Related Research, per Exhibit "A" and "B" attached hereto.
It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from any
development impact fee deposited in an impact fee account ever be commingled
with monies from a different impact fee account, or ever be used for a
development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was
paid, or ever be used to correct current deficiencies in the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District capital improvement plan or ever be used to replace,
rehabilitate, maintain, or operate any Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District facility. (Ord. 679, 2023)

17.19.050: DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES IMPOSED:
   A.   Fee Obligation:
      1.   After the effective date hereof, any person who commences any impact
generating land development, except those exempted pursuant to subsection (B)
of this section, shall be obligated to pay development impact fees upon
commencement of such activity. The amount of the development impact fees shall
be determined in accordance with this chapter.
      2.   If the fee payer is applying for an extension of a permit issued
previously, then the development impact fees required to be paid shall be the
net increase between the development impact fees applicable at the time of the
current permit application and any development impact fees previously paid
pursuant to this chapter to finance similar types of system improvements to
accommodate demands created by the same development.
      3.   If the fee payer is applying for a permit to allow a change of use
or for the expansion, redevelopment, or modification of an existing
development, the development impact fees required to be paid shall be based on
the net increase in the development impact fees for the new use as compared to
the previous use.
   B.   Exemptions: The following types of development shall be exempted from
payment of the development impact fees. Any claim for exemption shall be made
no later than the time when the applicant applies for the first building permit
for the proposed development that creates the obligation to pay the development
impact fees, and any claim for exemption not made at or before that time shall
have been waived. The P & Z Administrator or a designee shall determine the
validity of any claim for exemption pursuant to the criteria set forth below.
      1.   Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure that was
destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, providing the structure is rebuilt and
ready for occupancy within two (2) years of its destruction;
      2.   Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not increase the
number of service units;
      3.   Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with
another residential unit on the same lot, provided that the number of service

as tennis courts or clubhouses, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the
use creates a significant impact on the capacities Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District of system improvements;
      7.   The installation of a modular building, manufactured home, or
recreational vehicle if the fee payer can demonstrate by documentation such as
utility bills and tax records that either a) a modular building, manufactured
home, or recreational vehicle was legally in place on the lot or space prior to
the effective date hereof, or b) a development impact fee has been paid
previously for the installation of a modular building, manufactured home or
recreational vehicle on that same lot or space;
      8.   Projects for which a development impact fee for each type of public
facility covered by this chapter has previously been paid in an amount that
equals or exceeds the development impact fee that would be required by this
chapter;
      9.   Projects built by the Federal government or the State government;
and
      10.   Projects which meet all the following criteria may apply for an
individualized assessment pursuant to subsection C(4) of this section, except
that the applicant may simply rely on the documented project history rather
than retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment;
         a.   A development agreement was entered into by the project developer
and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District setting forth the
entitlements and obligations of the developer, which agreement was approved by
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Council prior to April 25th,
2023;
         b.   The final plat for the development, or site plan attached to the
development agreement, was approved by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District prior to April 25th, 2023; and
         c.   The development, through the terms of the development agreement,
or otherwise, has built, or is obligated to build public improvement plan,
which improvement plan are not "project improvements", in excess of the amount
that would be collected under this chapter.
   C.   Fee Table and Calculation Of Amount Of Development Impact Fees:
      1.   Fee Table
 
Facilities - Apparatus /Vehicles - Equipment - Capital Related Research -
Impact Study
 Residential    $1,439.00 per dwelling unit
 Nonresidential $0.58     per square foot
 
This fee schedule shall be in effect upon publication according to law and the
Kimberly P & Z Administrator receiving written notification from the Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District Administrator, to begin assessing development
impact fees.
On January 1, 2024, and on January 1 of each year thereafter in which an impact
fee is in effect, the amount of the impact fee shall be automatically adjusted
to account for year over year inflation increases in the actual capital
improvement costs, supporting the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District's
capital infrastructure plan, to serve new development utilizing the latest
available municipal cost index as published by "American Cities and County
Magazine". Nothing herein shall prevent the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District from electing to maintain an existing impact fee or from electing to
waive the inflation adjustment for any given fiscal year, or years. Any such
action to determine an inflation factor shall be by adoption of a resolution by
the City of Kimberly upon receiving a recommendation from the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District Commission.
      2.   Levels of Service: Current data used to determine (CIP) Current
Improvement Project Value for levels of service with Growth Portions for years
2023-2032 and years 2033-2042, per attached Exhibit "A" and "B" dated 02-07-
2023 are as follows:
         a.   Facilities - CIP Value = $4,860,000.00 for the entire district,
with a Growth Portion of 25% or $607,500 for yrs. 2023-2032, and a Growth
Portion of 25% or $607,500 for yrs. 2033-2042.
         b.   Apparatus/Vehicles = $1,463,000 for the entire district, with a
Growth Portion of 80% for two additional (2) Type 3 Trucks and one (1)
additional Ambulance or $1,170,400, for yrs. 2023-2032.
         c.   Capital-Related Research Impact Study = $20,000 for the entire
district, with a Growth Portion of 100% for yrs. 2023-2032.
      3.   Using The Fee Table: Development impact fees shall be calculated
using the fee table above (or as subsequently amended by the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District Commission and Kimberly City Council per automatic
adjustment criteria above) unless a) the fee payer requests an individualized
assessment pursuant to subsection (C) 4 of this section, or b) the Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District designates the proposed development as a
development of extraordinary impact in writing to the fee payer, in which case
the provisions of subsection (C) 5 of this section shall apply.
         a.   Any person who commences any new impact generating land
development, except those exempted pursuant to this chapter, or those preparing
an individual assessment pursuant to this chapter, shall pay all development
impact fees applicable to the proposed development, as determined by the fee
table. Persons choosing to pay applicable development impact fees pursuant to
the fee table shall be deemed to have made a full and complete payment of the
project's proportionate share of Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
capital improvement plan costs for system improvements, except as noted in
subsection
17.19.090 of this chapter.
         b.   If the proposed development is of a type not listed in the fee
table, then the Kimberly P & Z Administrator and Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District shall apply the development impact fees applicable to the
most nearly comparable type of land use listed in the fee table. The
determination as to which type of development is most nearly comparable to the
proposed development shall be made by referring to traffic generation rates for
land uses published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and by
identifying that land use listed in the fee table whose traffic generation
rates are most comparable to the proposed land use. If no traffic generation
rate for the proposed land use appears in a publication of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, or if it is not possible to determine which land use
listed in the fee table has the most comparable traffic generation rates, then
the most nearly comparable land use shall be determined by the Kimberly P & Z
Administrator and Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District based on comparison
of other characteristics of the proposed land use (including employment or
occupancy, the size of the facility, and the amount of parking to be provided)
with the characteristics of those land uses listed in the fee table.
         c.   If the proposed development includes a mix of those uses listed
in the fee table, then the development impact fees shall be determined by
adding up the development impact fees that would be payable for each use as if
it were a freestanding use pursuant to the fee table. For example, development
impact fees for a church without ancillary improvement plan will be determined
through the process in subsection (C)3. b of this section; but development
impact fees for a church with a daycare center shall be established by adding:
            (1)   Fees determined through the process in subsection (C)3.b. of
this section for the church itself; and
            (2)   Fees identified in the fee table for the daycare portion of
the facility.
         d.   If the fee payer requests that the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District calculate the amount of development impact fees due
pursuant to the fee table, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall
notify the fee payer of such amount within thirty (30) days after receipt of
that request.
      4.   Using An Individual Assessment:
         a.   In lieu of calculating the amount(s) of development impact fees
by reference to the fee table, a fee payer may request that the amount of the
required development impact fee be determined through an individual assessment
for the proposed development. The individual assessment process shall permit
consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by
the fee payer to adjust the amount of the fee. If a fee payer requests the use
of an individual assessment, the fee payer shall be responsible for retaining a
qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment that complies with
the requirements of this chapter, at the fee payer's expense. The fee payer
shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the
resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its proportionate
share of the cost of Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital
improvements, based on the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District's adopted
levels of service, than the development impact fees that would otherwise be due
pursuant to the fee table. The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may
hire a professional consultant to review any independent impact fee calculation
study on behalf of the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District and may charge
the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
         b.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same level of
service standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the
development impact fee study, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost)
methodology, and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions
used.
         c.   An application for an individual assessment may be submitted at
any time that the number of dwelling units in the proposed development and the
types and amounts of development in each nonresidential category identified in
the fee table is known. The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall
issue a decision within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed
application for individual assessment and supporting information from the
applicant, so as not to unreasonably delay subsequent applications for or
issuance of building permits.
         d.   Each individual assessment shall be submitted to the Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District, Kimberly P & Z Administrator or a designee, and
may be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District and the P & Z Administrator or a designee as the basis
for calculating development impact fees. The criteria for acceptance,
rejection, or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual
assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District capital improvement element(s) created by the proposed
development, or the costs of those in the improvement plan with the applicable
fee shown in the fee table.
         e.   The decision by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
Administrator, or designee and the P & Z Administrator or designee on an
application for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the
calculation of the impact fee, shall specify the system improvement(s) for
which the impact fee is intended to be used, and shall include an explanation
of those factors identified in Idaho Code section 67-8207.
         f.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator,
or designee and P & Z Administrator or a designee then the development impact
fees due under this chapter for such development shall be calculated according
to such individual assessment.
      5.   Extraordinary Impacts:
         a.   If the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator,
determines that a proposed development generates extraordinary impacts that
will result in extraordinary costs, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District Administrator, will notify the fee payer of such determination within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a request for a certification pursuant to
subsection 5(D) of this section or a request for a building permit or
development approval, whichever occurs first. Such notice shall include a
statement that the potential impacts of such development on system improvements
are not adequately addressed by the development impact fee study, and that a
supplemental study at the fee payer's expense will be required.
         b.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of extraordinary
impacts include, but are not limited to 1) an indication that traffic
generation from the proposed development or activity will exceed those typical
for a facility or activity of its type, 2) an indication that employment
generated by the development or activity will exceed those typical for a
facility or activity of its type, 3) an indication the assumptions used in the
development impact fee study underestimate the level of activity or impact on
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan from the
proposed development or activity, or 4) an indication that levels of calls for
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District services from developments or
activities owned or operated by the fee payer or its agents exceed the
assumptions used in the development impact fee study.
         c.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a
development with extraordinary impacts, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District shall meet with the fee payer to discuss whether the fee payer wants
to 1) pay for the supplemental study necessary to determine the system
improvement costs related to the proposed development, or 2) modify the
proposal to avoid generating extraordinary impacts, or 3) withdraw the
application for certification, building permit, or development approval.
         d.   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study
required to document the proposed development's proportionate share of system
improvement costs, then the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
Administrator and the fee payer shall jointly select an individual or
organization acceptable to both to perform such study, the fee payer shall
enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization to pay the
costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental study to be
completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless the fee
payer agrees to a longer time.
         e.   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to 1)
pay the proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the
supplemental study, or 2) modify the proposed development to reduce such costs,
or 3) withdraw the application. If the fee payer agrees to pay the system
improvement costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be
reduced to writing between the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District and
the fee payer prior to review and consideration of any application for any
development approval or building permit related to the proposed development.
         f.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the
proportionate share of system improvement costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this chapter shall obligate the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District to approve development that results in an extraordinary
impact.
   D.   Certification After the development impact fees due for a proposed
development have been calculated pursuant to the fee table or the individual
assessment, the fee payer may request the Kimberly P & Z Administrator, Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District, or a designee for a certification of the
amount of development impact fees due for that development. Within thirty (30)
days after receiving such request, the P & Z Administrator or a designee shall
issue a written certification of the amount of development impact fees due for
the proposed development. Such certification shall establish the development
impact fee so long as there is no material change to the particular project as
identified in the individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule
set forth in the fee table. The certification shall include an explanation of
the calculation of the impact fee including an explanation of factors
considered under Idaho Code section 67-8207 and shall also specify the system
improvement(s) for which the development impact fee is intended to be used.
   E.   Payment Of Fees:
      1.   All development impact fees due shall be made payable to Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District in accordance to Section
17.19.020, and paid to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District at the
following times.
         a.   If a building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time such permit is issued; or
         b.   If no building permit or building placement permit is required,
then at the time that construction commences; or
         c.   At such other time as the applicant and the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District have agreed to in writing, pursuant to applicable Idaho
law.
      2.   All monies paid to Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District by a
fee payer pursuant to the fee table shall be identified as development impact
fees and shall be promptly deposited in the appropriate Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District account(s) described in section
17.19.070 of this chapter.
      3.   A fee payer may pay a Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
development impact fee under protest in order to avoid delay in the issuance of
a building permit or development approval. A fee payer making a payment under
protest shall not be estopped from exercising the right of appeal provided in
section
17.19.100 of this chapter, nor shall such fee payer be estopped from receiving
a refund of any amount deemed to have been illegally collected. (Ord. 679,
2023)
17.19.060: SERVICE AREAS:
The following service areas are established for each development impact fee
element:
   A.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District impact fee service area

Creek Rural Fire Protection District may hold development impact fees for
longer than eight (8) years if it identifies in writing 1) a reasonable cause
why the fees should be held longer than eight (8) years; and 2) an anticipated
date by which the fees will be expended, but in no event greater than eleven
(11) years from the date they were collected. If the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District complies with the previous sentence, then any development
impact fees identified in such writing shall be refunded to the fee payer if
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District has failed to commence
construction of system improvements in accordance with this chapter, or to
appropriate funds for such construction on or before the date identified in
such writing.
   C.   No Refund Due: Later Changes to Development After a development impact
fee has been paid pursuant to this chapter and after a certificate of occupancy
has been issued, no refund of any part of such fee shall be made if the project
for which the fee was paid is later demolished, destroyed, or is altered,
reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to reduce the size of the project or the
number of units in the project.
   D.   Interest: Each refund shall include a refund of interest at one half
(½) the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date
on which the fee was originally paid.
   E.   Timing: The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall make a
determination of whether a refund is due within thirty (30) days after receipt
of a written request for a refund from the owner of record of the property for
which the fee was paid. When the right to a refund exists, the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District shall refund the applicable fees, to the owner of
record within ninety (90) days after the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District determines that a refund is due.
   F.   Standing: Any person entitled to a refund shall have standing to sue
for a refund under the provisions of this chapter if there has not been a
timely payment of a refund pursuant to subsections A through E of this section.
(Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.090: CREDITS AGAINST DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Credits: To Be Issued When a developer, or their predecessor in title
or interest, has constructed system improvements of the same category as a Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital improvements element, or
contributed or dedicated land or money towards the completion of system
improvements of the same category as a Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District capital improvements element, and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District has accepted such construction, contribution, or dedication, the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall issue a credit against the
development impact fees otherwise due for the same Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District capital improvements element in connection with the
proposed development, as set forth in this section. Credit shall be issued
regardless of whether the contribution or dedication to system improvements was
required by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District as a condition of
development approval or was offered by the developer and accepted by the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District in writing, and regardless of whether the
contribution or dedication was contributed by the developer or by a local
improvement district controlled by the developer.
   B.   Limitations Credits against development impact fees shall not be given
for 1) project improvements, or 2) any construction: contribution, or
dedication not agreed to in writing by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District prior to commencement of the construction, contribution, or
dedication. Credits issued for one Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
capital improvements element, may not be used to reduce development impact fees
due for a different capital improvements element. No credits shall be issued
for system improvements contributed or dedicated prior to the effective date
hereof.
   C.   Valuation Of Credit at Present Value
      1.   Land Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the fee
payer's option, be valued at the present value of a) one hundred percent (100%)
of the most recent assessed value for such land as shown in the records of the
county assessor, or b) that fair market value established by a private
appraiser acceptable to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District in an
appraisal paid for by the fee payer. In the event that Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District and the fee payer cannot agree upon an appraiser, either
may petition the district court for appointment of an appraiser.
      2.   Improvements Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall be valued by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District at the present value of such improvements based on complete
engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates submitted
by the fee payer to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District. The Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall determine the amount of credit due
based on the information submitted, or, if it determines that such information
is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction
costs acceptable to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District as a more
accurate measure of the value of the offered system improvements to the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District.
   D.   When Credits Become Effective:
      1.   Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District in
a form acceptable to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District at no cost
to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District, and has been accepted by the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District. When such conditions have been met,
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall note that fact in its
records. Upon request of the fee payer, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
      2.   Approved credits for acquisition or construction of system
improvements shall generally become effective when, a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District, b) a suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been
received and approved by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District, and c)
all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and acceptance
procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable requirements
of the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District and the state of Idaho.
Approved credits for the construction of system improvements may become
effective at an earlier date if the fee payer posts security in the form of a
performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement and the
amount and terms of such security are accepted by the P & Z Administrator or a
designee. At a minimum, such security must be in the amount of the approved
credit or an amount determined to be adequate to allow the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District to construct the system improvements for which the
credit was given, whichever is higher. When such conditions have been met, the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall note that fact in its records.
Upon request of the fee payer, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
   E.   Application Procedures:
      1.   In order to obtain a credit against development impact fees
otherwise due, a fee payer shall submit a written offer to the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District Administrator or a designee to dedicate specific
parcels of qualifying land or a written offer to contribute or construct
specific system improvements to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
capital improvement plan in accordance with all applicable state or Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District design and construction standards, and shall
specifically request a credit against the type of development impact fees for
which the land dedication or system improvement is offered. No request for a
credit against development impact fees shall be accepted unless a written offer
to dedicate, contribute, or construct has previously been approved in writing
by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator.
      2.   After receipt of the request for credit, the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District Administrator and Kimberly P & Z Administrator or a
designee shall review the request and determine whether the land or system
improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District capital improvement plan by an amount at least
equal to the value of the credit. If Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
Administrator, the P & Z Administrator, or a designee determines that the
offered credit satisfies that criterion, then Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District shall process the credit to be issued. The Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District Administrator shall complete its review and determination
of an application for credit within thirty (30) days after receipt of an
application for credit.
   F.   Transferability Of Credit: A credit may only be transferred by the fee
payer that has received the credit to a successor in interest pursuant to the
terms of this chapter. The credit may be used only to offset development impact
fees for the same Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District capital
improvements element for which the credit was issued. Credits shall be
transferred by any written instrument from the fee payer, clearly identifying
which credits issued under this chapter are being transferred, the dollar
amount of the credit being transferred, and the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District capital improvements element for which the credit was
issued. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District Administrator, both the transferor and transferee, and a
copy of the document shall be delivered to the Kimberly P & Z Administrator or
a designee for documentation of the change in ownership before it shall become
effective.
   G.   Accounting Of Credits: Each time a request to use approved credits is
presented to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator, the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall reduce the amount of the
development impact fees for the type of fee for which the credit is provided,
and shall note in the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District's records the
amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the fee payer or successor
in interest to whom the credit was issued, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit remaining.
   H.   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due: If the credit due to a fee payer
pursuant to subsections A through G of this section, exceeds the development
impact fee that would otherwise be due from the fee payer pursuant to section
17.19.90 of this chapter (whether calculated through the fee table in section
17.19.050 of this chapter or through an independent assessment), the fee payer
may choose to receive such credit in the form of either 1) a credit against
future development impact fees due for the same capital improvements element,
or 2) a reimbursement from development impact fees paid by future development
that impacts the system improvements contributed or dedicated by the fee payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the fee payer, the Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District shall be under no obligation to use any Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District funds, other than development impact fees
paid by other development for the same Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District capital improvements element, to reimburse the fee payer for any
credit in excess of development impact fees due.
   I.   Written Agreement Required: If credit or reimbursement is due to the
fee payer pursuant to this section, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District Administrator shall enter into a written agreement with the fee payer,
negotiated in good faith, prior to the contribution, dedication, or funding of
the system improvements giving rise to the credit. The agreement shall provide
for the amount of credit or the amount, time and form of reimbursement, and
shall have a term not exceeding ten (10) years. (Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.100: APPEALS AND MEDIATION:
Disputes regarding decisions made in the application of this chapter shall be
resolved through appeal to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
Administrator and Commission, or through mediation, as set forth below
   A.   Right To Appeal:
      1.   Any fee payer that is or may be obligated to pay a development
impact fee, or that claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, or
credit under this chapter, and who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator, Kimberly P & Z
Administrator, or a designee in applying this chapter, shall first request that
the Kimberly P & Z Administrator reconsider the decision. A fee payer
requesting reconsideration shall state in writing to the Kimberly P & Z
Administrator the reasons why the fee payer believes the decision to be in
error. The Kimberly P & Z Administrator shall issue a written decision
confirming or modifying the decision within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a
written request for reconsideration.
      2.   Any fee payer that is dissatisfied with the decision of the Kimberly
P & Z Administrator upon reconsideration pursuant to subsection A (1) of this
section, may appeal such decision to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District Administrator or Commission. The fee payer shall have the burden of
proving by clear and convincing evidence that the decision was in error.
      3.   In order to pursue the appeal described in subsection A (2) of this
section, the fee payer shall file a written notice of the appeal with the
Kimberly P & Z Administrator or a designee within thirty (30) days after the
date of the reconsideration, or the date on which the fee payer submitted a
payment of development impact fees under protest, whichever is later. Such
written application shall include a statement describing why the fee payer
believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any documents
that the fee payer believes support the claim.
      4.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Administrator and
Commission shall hear the appeal within sixty (60) days after receipt of a
written notice of appeal. The fee payer shall have a right to be present and to
present evidence in support of the appeal. The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District Administrator and Kimberly P & Z Administrator or designee who made
the decision under appeal shall likewise have the right to be present and to
present evidence in support of the decision. The criteria to be used by the
Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Commission in considering the appeal
shall be whether a) the decision or interpretation made by the Kimberly P & Z
Administrator after reconsideration, or b) the alternative decision or
interpretation offered by the fee payer more accurately reflects the
proportionate share of the costs of system improvements to the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District capital improvement plan necessary to serve new
development and whether this chapter has been correctly applied. The Rock Creek
Rural Fire Protection District Commission shall issue a decision upholding,
reversing, or modifying the decision being appealed within thirty (30) days
after hearing the appeal.
   B.   Mediation:
      1.   Any fee payer that has a disagreement with the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District regarding a development impact fee that is or may be due
for a proposed development pursuant to this chapter, may enter into a voluntary
agreement with the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District to subject the
disagreement to mediation by a qualified independent party acceptable to both
the fee payer and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District.
      2.   Mediation may take place at any time following the filing of a
timely appeal pursuant to this section, or as an alternative to such appeal,
provided that the request for mediation is filed no later than the last date on
which a timely appeal could be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section.
      3.   Participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from
pursuing other remedies provided for in subsection A of this section.
      4.   If mediation is requested, any related mediation costs shall be
shared equally by the fee payer and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District, and a written agreement regarding the payment of such costs shall be
executed prior to the commencement of mediation.
      5.   In the event that mediation does not resolve the issues between the
parties, the fee payer retains all rights to seek relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.200: ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION:
When any development impact fee is due pursuant to the terms of this chapter,
or pursuant to the terms of any written agreement between a fee payer Kimberly
P & Z Administrator and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District
authorized by this chapter, and such fee has not been paid in a timely manner,
the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may exercise any or all of the
following powers, in any combination, to enforce the collection of the fee
   A.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may request the City of

the development for which the fee is due until all development impact fees due
have been paid.
   B.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may request the City of
Kimberly withhold utility services from the development for which the fee is
due until all development impact fees due have been paid.
   C.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may add to the amount of
the fee interest at the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104
from the date on which the fee was due.
   D.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District may impose liens for
failure to timely pay a development impact fee following procedures contained
in chapter 5, title 45, Idaho Code. (Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.300: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any additional
right to develop real property or diminish the power of the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District in regulating the orderly development of real
property.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District to approve any development request that may reasonably be
expected to reduce levels of service below minimum acceptable levels
established in the development impact fee study.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict or diminish the power of the
Kimberly P & Z Administrator and Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District 1)
to impose reasonable conditions on the annexation of any property to the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District in accordance with Idaho Code, including
conditions for recovery of project or system improvement costs required as a
result of such voluntary annexation, or 2) to negotiate and execute development
agreements that may impose additional conditions on development, including the
recovery of project or system improvement costs, either in connection with a
proposed annexation or in connection with any other development within the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District .
   D.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a
project for which a complete application for a building permit has been
received by the Kimberly P & Z Administrator and the Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District, prior to the effective date hereof shall not be subject to
the development impact fees imposed by this chapter. If the resulting building
permit is later revised or replaced after the effective date hereof, and the
new building permit reflects a development density, intensity, or number of
units more than ten percent (10%) higher than that reflected in the original
building permit, then development impact fees may be charged on the difference
in density, intensity, or number of units between the original and the revised
or replacement building permit.
   E.   Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the Kimberly P & Z Administrator
and Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District from requiring fee payer or an
applicant for a development approval or building permit to construct reasonable
project improvements required to serve the applicant's project, provided that
such request does not duplicate a system improvement in a category for which
costs were included in the development impact fee study.
   F.   Any monies, including any accrued interest not assigned to specific
system improvements within such capital improvements program and not expended
pursuant to section
17.19.070 of this chapter or refunded pursuant to section
17.19.070 of this chapter shall be retained in the same account until the next
fiscal year.
   G.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall be entitled to
collect and retain a surcharge on each development impact fee collected in
order to recoup that portion of the cost of preparing the capital improvements
plan that is attributable to determining the development impact. Such surcharge
does not exceed each development's proportionate share of the cost of preparing
the plan.
   H.   If the Kimberly P & Z Administrator and Rock Creek Rural Fire
Protection District, discovers an error in the development impact fee study
that results in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share of
system improvement costs on any proposed development, the Kimberly P & Z
Administrator and Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District shall 1) adjust the
development impact fee to collect no more than a proportionate share or 2)
discontinue the collection of any development impact fees until the error is
corrected by ordinance.
   I.   If development impact fees are calculated and paid based on a mistake
or misrepresentation, they shall be recalculated. Any amounts overpaid by a fee
payer shall be refunded by the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District within
thirty (30) days after the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District's
acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the legal rate provided
for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from the date on which the fee was paid.
Any amounts underpaid by the fee payer shall be paid to the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District within thirty (30) days after the Rock Creek Rural
Fire Protection District 's acceptance of the recalculated amount, with
interest at the legal rate provided for in Idaho Code section 28-22-104 from
the date on which the fee was paid. In the case of an underpayment to the
Kimberly Planning and Zoning Administrator may withhold issuance of building
permits or development approvals for the project for which the development
impact fee was paid until such underpayment is corrected, and if amounts owed
to the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District are not paid within such
thirty (30) day period, the Kimberly Planning and Zoning Administrator may also
repeal any building permits or development approvals issued in reliance on the
previous payment of such development impact fee and refund such fee to the fee
payer.
   J.   The Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Commission, shall
consider their Development Impact Fee Advisory Committee's recommended revision
(s) to this chapter at least once every twelve (12) months. Their committee's
recommendations and the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection District Commission
actions are intended to ensure that the benefits to a fee-paying development
are equitable, in that the fee charged to the development shall not exceed a
proportionate share of the costs of system improvements, and the procedures for
administering development impact fees remain efficient.
   K.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit
private agreements between developers, the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District, City of Kimberly, Twin Falls Highway District, Twin Falls Canal Co.,
Kimberly School District, the Idaho Transportation Department, and/or other
governmental entities in regard to the construction or installation of system
improvements or providing for credits or reimbursements for system improvement
costs incurred by a developer or fee payer, including interproject transfers of
credits, or providing for reimbursement for project improvements that are used
or shared by more than one development project. If it can be shown that a
proposed development has a direct impact on a public facility under the
jurisdiction noted herein above but not limited to, then the agreement shall
include a provision for the allocation of development impact fees collected
from the developer or fee payer for the Rock Creek Rural Fire Protection
District improvements by the applicable jurisdiction. (Ord. 679, 2023)
17.19.400: PENALTY FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   Violation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor and shall subject the
violator to those remedies provided in Kimberly City Code, Chapter 1.16 Section
1.16.010.
   B.   Knowingly furnishing false information to any official of the Rock
Creek Rural Fire Protection District charged with the administration of this
chapter on any matter relating to the administration of this chapter,
including, without limitation, the furnishing of false information regarding
the expected size, use, or impacts from a proposed development, shall be a
violation of this chapter. (Ord. 679, 2023)
