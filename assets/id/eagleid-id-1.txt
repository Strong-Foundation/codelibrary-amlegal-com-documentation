11A-2-4 SETBACKS AND GENERAL LOT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS:
These standards are designed to ensure that development within Spring Valley
will produce a built environment of stable, desirable character which is
harmonious with existing and future development and is consistent with the
intent and purpose of the Spring Valley master plan. Centralized water and
wastewater facilities are required for all subdivision and lot split
applications in all land use districts exceeding one dwelling unit per two (2)
acres.
   A.   General Setback Standards:
      1.   Minimum residential and nonresidential district setbacks are
outlined in tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of this section. More restrictive setbacks
may be established through the Spring Valley design guidelines prepared by the
master developer.
      2.   Dwelling units located in the VC, HMU, MU, and NC districts shall
use the setback standards for either the applicable nonresidential district or
for the corresponding residential district based on density. (For example, a
single-family detached neighborhood with a density of up to 10 units per acre
in the VC district would use the standards of the SF3 residential district.)
      3.   Dwelling units that are stacked above nonresidential uses shall use
the setbacks of the nonresidential district.
      4.   Dwelling units shall adhere to the setbacks outlined in table 2.2 of
this section unless identified in this subsection or building envelopes are
used in which case the more restrictive setbacks shall apply.
      5.   Residential setbacks for front, side and rear loaded single- family
units shall be measured from the back of sidewalk, or back of curb if no
sidewalk exists, or edge of pavement if no curb exists, to the foundation of a
building or the face of a garage. All other setbacks shall be measured to the
property line or as otherwise noted.
      6.   Driveway length shall be nineteen feet (19') minimum beyond the back
of sidewalk, or back of curb if no sidewalk exists, or edge of pavement if no
curb exists to allow vehicles to park completely outside the vehicular or
pedestrian travel corridor, or three to five feet (3 - 5') to prevent a vehicle
from parking in the driveway. No more than three (3) consecutive dwelling units
in a row shall have front loaded driveways between three to five feet (3 - 5')
in length. There shall be no such restriction for rear loaded dwelling units.
      7.   Bay windows, nooks, architectural pop outs and appendages,
fireplaces, cabinets designed to screen utility meters and similar
architectural features may encroach no more than two feet (2') into any
setback, provided they remain at least three feet (3') from the side property
lines and ten feet (10') from the front property line, and do not increase the
living space within the home at the floor line. The maximum width of such
structures shall not exceed thirteen feet (13') in total for any facade.
      8.   Roof overhangs, cornices, and similar architectural features may
encroach no more than two feet (2') into any setback provided they remain at
least three feet (3') from the property line.
      9.   Balconies must maintain the setback required for the structure to
which they are attached and may not extend into the required setback area
except on lots which adjoin a golf course, park area, common open space, or
similar open space. In such case the balcony may extend into the setback area
toward the open space a distance equal to fifty percent (50%) of the required
setback provided they remain at least five feet (5') from the property line.
Balconies on multi-family units may also overhang a sidewalk up to five feet
(5') so long as they do not encroach into the public right of way.
      10.   Interior fire escapes are encouraged. Exterior fire escapes shall
encroach no more than six feet (6') into any setback provided they remain at
least three feet (3') from the property line. Exterior fire escapes are allowed
in the side or rear yards only.
      11.   Accessory dwellings, including guesthouses, casitas, and caretaker/
domestic units shall comply with the setback and height standards for the
district they are located in as set forth in tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of this
section or as otherwise described in
chapter 4 of this title.
      12.   Accessory structures shall not be permitted in the front or street
side yards except for garages and accessory dwellings which shall comply with
the setback standards of the applicable residential district. Accessory
structures less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area and less than
seven feet (7') in height are permitted in the interior side or rear yards, but
must remain at least five feet (5') from the property line and maintain a
minimum separation of six feet (6') from the principal dwelling. Accessory
structures one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area or larger shall comply
with the minimum setbacks shown in tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of this section and
shall be limited to a maximum height of twenty five feet (25').
      13.   Attached patio covers, awnings, carports, trellises and similar
structures and architectural elements within residential districts may encroach
no more than two feet (2') into the front setback and may encroach into the
side and rear setbacks up to fifteen feet (15') provided they remain at least
five feet (5') from the property line. These setbacks are measured from the
supporting posts; however, overhangs may extend up to three feet (3') from a
property line. Such structures must remain open without the use of siding,
screens or other enclosures. Enclosed structures must conform to the setback
standards for the principal dwelling.
      14.   Awnings, trellises and similar structures and architectural
elements in nonresidential districts may overhang a sidewalk up to six feet
(6') so long as they do not encroach into the public right of way or affect a
tree canopy.
      15.   Open porches for residential dwellings may project up to five feet
(5') into the required front yard setback provided they remain at least three
feet (3') from the back of a sidewalk or eight feet (8') from the back of a
curb if no sidewalk exists.
      16.   Swimming pools shall only be permitted in the side or rear yard
areas. Swimming pools shall maintain a minimum setback of three feet (3') from
the water's edge to property lines and easements. Any setback, if required,
from the dwelling or other buildings on the same lot shall be determined by the
city building department.
   B.   Building Heights:
      1.   Building heights shall be measured from the finished floor elevation
closest to the finished grade to the top of the roof. The height of the
building may follow the slope of the contour of the lot (grade adaptive
architecture). "Top of roof" means ridgeline or the highest point of any
architectural element concealing rooftop equipment, excluding chimneys and
vents. The height restrictions are not intended to limit the number of stories.
      2.   Height restrictions do not apply to chimneys, which are governed by
the building code.
      3.   Themed, nonhabitable structures or parts of structures, such as
church steeples and clock towers, may be allowed up to sixty feet (60') in
height in the CC, NC and residential districts and may be allowed up to seventy
five feet (75') in height in the VC, HMU and MU districts with a conditional
use permit, except where the height of such structures will constitute a hazard
to the safe landing and takeoff of aircraft at an established airport.
      4.   Refer to tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of this section for maximum
building heights.
   C.   Residential Density:
      1.   Residential density, as shown on table 2.2 of this section, shall be
determined on a gross area basis. Gross area includes the area within the
adjacent right of way to the centerline of the street prior to any right of way
dedication.
   D.   Refuse Storage/Disposal: Every parcel with a multi-family or commercial
use shall have a trash receptacle on the premises. The trash receptacle shall
be of sufficient size to accommodate the trash generated by the use and must be
a minimum of fifty feet (50') from any single-family residential property. The
receptacle shall be screened from public view on at least three (3) sides by a
solid wall or structure that is constructed to be a minimum of 1-foot (1')
above the height of the trash and/or recycle receptacle within the collection
area measured from finish surface and on the fourth side by a solid gate not
less than the height of the trash and/or recycle receptacle. Trash structures
must be compatible in materials with the principal building(s). Trash
receptacles for single-family homes must be stored within the enclosed garage
or screened from the right of way behind a fence.
   E.   Hillside Development And Grade Adaptive Housing: Guidelines for
hillside development and grade adaptive housing are contained in the grading
guidelines and hillside development standards for Spring Valley.
   F.   Side And Rear Yards For Nonresidential Uses Abutting Residential
Districts: Nonresidential buildings or uses shall not be located nor conducted
closer than forty feet (40') to any lot line of a residential district; except
that the minimum yard requirements may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) of the
requirement if acceptable screening approved by the city is provided. Such
screening shall be a masonry or solid fence between four (4) and eight feet
(8') in height, maintained in good condition and free of all advertising or
other signs along with landscaping in accordance with the buffer area and
screening requirements in the Spring Valley landscape guidelines. Landscaping
provided in lieu of such wall or fence shall not be allowed.

50 feet wide. In the SF2 district, the rear setback may be reduced to 15 feet
if the same condition exists.
   2.    In the SFZL and SFA districts, the front building setback, exclusive
of the garage, may be eight feet (8'). The front setback to a side entry garage
may also be eight feet (8'). The setback to a front entry garage shall be
either nineteen feet (19') or more or three to five feet (3' to 5'). Setbacks
between five feet (5') and nineteen feet (19') are not allowed.
   3.    In the SFZL district, the side setback shown is for the nonzero lot
line of the dwelling. In the SFA district, the side setback shown is for the

The purpose of the EASD book is to show, through the use of pictures and text,
specific period architectural styles, themes, and elements envisioned through
the requirements of this title. The EASD book, established through a resolution
of the city council, contains many of the exhibits referenced in this title and
is incorporated herein by reference. The architecture styles found in the EASD
book are permitted styles. Architectural styles not shown within the EASD book
will not be considered. A copy of the EASD book is available at Eagle City
Hall. All applications made pursuant to this title shall also be reviewed in
accordance with the Eagle architecture and site design book. (Ord. 710, 1-14-
2014)
11A-3-6 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS, OBJECTIVES AND CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   General Objectives And Considerations: The following apply to Spring
Valley. The following, including the provisions set forth in the Eagle
architecture and site design book, contains a listing of objectives applied to
each application, and a listing of matters which shall be considered by the
design review board. The objectives are separated into two (2) sections: site
design and building design. Specific aspects of design should be examined to
determine whether the proposed development will provide a desirable environment
for its occupants as well as for its neighbors, and whether, aesthetically, the
composition, materials, textures and colors meet the intent of this title. The
design review board shall consider the following criteria in reviewing the
application:
      1.   Site Design Objectives: The site plan design shall minimize impact
of traffic on adjacent streets, provide for the pedestrian, and provide
appropriate, safe parking lot design.
         a.   The functional relationship of the structures and the site in
relation to its surroundings;
         b.   The impact and effect of the site development plan on traffic
conditions on contiguous streets and adjoining properties or neighborhoods;
         c.   The site layout with respect to separation or integration of
vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic patterns;
         d.   The arrangement and adequacy of off street parking facilities
relative to access points, building location and total site development to
prevent traffic conflict or congestion;
         e.   The location, arrangement and dimensions of truck loading ramps,
docks, and bays and vehicle service facilities;
         f.   The access, parking lot, and interior roadway illumination plans
and hours of operation;
         g.   The required driver, pedestrian and bicycle sight distance
requirements of the project and their relationship to adjacent streets,
driveways and properties;

way alignments, acquisitions and street improvements;
         i.   The graphic delineation of traffic circulation patterns to avoid
confusion, congestion and conflicts;
         j.   The continued maintenance of traffic, parking and lighting
systems;
         k.   The protection of views and vistas in relation to urban design
and aesthetic considerations; and
         l.   The provision of safe pedestrian and bicycle connections between
neighborhoods and commercial areas.
      2.   Site Landscaping: The site landscaping shall minimize impact on
adjacent properties through the proper use of screening with sound and sight
buffers, and unsightly areas shall be concealed or screened and the design
review board shall consider:
         a.   The location, height, and materials of walls, fences, hedges and
screen plantings to ensure harmony with adjacent development;
         b.   The location and type of new plantings, with due regard to
preservation of specimen and landmark trees, and to maintenance of all
plantings;
         c.   The providing of screen plantings or other screening methods
reasonably required to conceal outdoor storage areas, trash receptacles,
service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and other unsightly
developments;
         d.   The installation of sound and sight buffers, the preservation of
public views, light and air, and the consideration of those landscape aspects
of design which may have substantial effects on neighborhood development, land
uses, and amenities;
         e.   The design and use of open spaces and parks; and
         f.   The permanent maintenance of all landscaped areas and fencing.
      3.   Site Grading And Drainage: The on site grading and drainage shall be
designed so as to maximize land use benefits and to minimize off site impact
and provide for slope and soil stabilization to prevent erosion and the design
review board shall consider:
         a.   The existing and proposed grading relative to soil removal, fill
work, retainage, soil stabilization, erosion control on the site and the
adjacent terrain and streets, and adoption of the development to the existing
site contours;
         b.   The planting of ground covers or shrubbery to prevent dust, to
stabilize soils and embankments and to control erosion;
         c.   Existing and proposed storm drainageways, canals, floodway and
floodplains relative to flow or alignment alterations, containment and
endangerment of health; and
         d.   The maintenance of floodway, floodplains, drainageways, channels,
culverts, head gates, canals, and soils.
      4.   Signage: Signing for any project shall provide for business
identification and minimize clutter and confusion on and off the site, and
shall be in compliance with this chapter. The design review board shall
consider:
         a.   The "overall sign concept" for multi-tenant business centers to
assure that it addresses the continuity between tenant sign design and building
design;
         b.   The reduction of hazards to motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians
as may be caused by or partially attributable to the distraction and
obstruction of improperly located and designed signs;
         c.   The provision for effective and necessary business identification
systems adapted to the building design;
         d.   The continued maintenance of signs throughout their life; and
         e.   The size, location, design, color, texture, lighting,
landscaping, and hours of operations of all permanent signs and outdoor
advertising structures or features to ensure that any such proposals do not
detract from the function of, or design of, buildings, structures, surrounding
properties, neighborhoods, or streets.
      5.   Utilities: Utility service systems shall not detract from building
or site design. Cable, electrical, and telephone service systems shall be
installed underground, and the design review board shall consider:

relationship with existing development in the immediate surrounding area and
with the allowed use proposed by the applicant;
         b.   Proportion Of Building: The height to width relationship of new
structures shall be compatible and consistent with the architectural character
of the area and proposed use;
         c.   Relationship Of Openings In The Buildings: Openings in the
building shall provide interest through the use of such features as balconies,
bays, porches, covered entries, overhead structures, awnings, changes in
building facade and roofline alignment, to provide shadow relief. Avoid
monotonous flat planes;
         d.   Relationship Of Exterior Materials: The design review board shall
determine the appropriateness of materials as they relate to building mass,
shadow relief, and existing area development. Use of color to provide blending
of materials with the surrounding area and building use, and the functional
appropriateness of the proposed building design as it relates to the proposed
use shall be considered; and

14-2014; amd. Ord. 889, 1-10-2022; Ord. 924, 8-27-2024)
11A-3-7 LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER AREA REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Overview And Intent: The existing (nondeveloped) landscape character of
Spring Valley, and much of the North Eagle Foothills, is predominantly
nonnative grasslands with some shrubs and agriculture and is quite different
from the rest of Eagle and the Boise River corridor which contain dense
plantings and large buffer areas along arterials and collector roadways,
irrigated pastures, and riparian woodlands. The intent of these standards is to
provide a landscape character that is appropriate to the foothills and balances
aesthetics and livability with water demands and availability. These standards
promote water conservation through the use of treated effluent for irrigation,
efficient irrigation systems, and the use of native and other plants that
require little or no irrigation to survive. In addition, these guidelines shall
be used in conjunction with the grading guidelines and hillside development
standards, habitat mitigation plan and wildfire management plan.
The landscape concept for Spring Valley can be best described as a "foothills
landscape". This concept is based on the landscape of the Northern Rocky
Mountain Foothills and high plains prairie. Foothills landscape will be
characterized by diverse layers of both deciduous and evergreen shrubs and
trees that will create interest through its broad palette of indigenous
material and other plants, including turf, utilized throughout the region. This
concept also takes advantage of soil and exposure conditions to develop
potential vineyard groves throughout the community with the rolling foothills
as the backdrop.
   B.   Landscape Plan Required: A landscape plan is required for all
developments requiring a design review, including, but not limited to, all
subdivisions. The landscape plan shall be drawn to scale (no smaller than 1
inch equals 30 feet) and shall indicate the following:
      1.   Boundaries, property lines, and dimensions.
      2.   Existing trees and vegetation identified by species and size.
      3.   The location and design of areas to be landscaped.
      4.   The location and labels for all proposed plants.
      5.   Plant lists or schedules with the botanical and common name,
quantity, and spacing and size of all proposed landscape material at the time
of planting.
      6.   Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as
earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture,
lights, and courts or paved areas.
      7.   Planting and installation details as necessary to ensure conformance
with all required standards.
   C.   Landscape As Percent Of Site:
      1.   Landscaping shall cover a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the
property on multi-family residential developments. Hardscape plaza areas, such
as decorative concrete/paver patios that are integrated into the design of the
landscaped area, may be included in the fifteen percent (15%) landscape
coverage requirement.
      2.   Landscaping shall cover a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the
property on all other developments. Hardscape plaza areas, such as decorative
concrete/paver patios that are integrated into the design of the landscaped
area, may be included in the ten percent (10%) landscape coverage requirement.
      3.   All landscape improvements required in this chapter shall count
toward fulfillment of the above minimum percentages.
      4.   If only a portion of a property is being developed, and if the city
does not require improvements on the entire property, improvements to landscape
shall continue a minimum of twenty five feet (25') (on site) beyond the
proposed development.
   D.   Tree Retention, Removal and Replacement:
      1.   Retention Of Existing Trees:
         a.   Existing trees shall be retained unless removal is approved in
writing by the city.
      2.   Removal And Replacement Of Existing Trees:
         a.   Where trees are approved by the city to be removed, replacement
with a species identified in section 11A-3-7(Y) of this article is required.
For each caliper inch of deciduous tree removed, an equivalent amount of
caliper inches shall be replanted. For each vertical foot of coniferous tree
removed, an equivalent amount of vertical feet shall be replanted.
Example: An eight inch (8") caliper deciduous tree is removed, an acceptable
replacement would be four (4) two inch (2") caliper deciduous trees. A twelve
foot (12') tall coniferous tree is removed, an acceptable replacement would be
two (2) six feet (6') tall coniferous trees.
         b.   When a homeowners association or its agent removes tree(s) from a
subdivision common area to appropriately thin an overgrown canopy, replacement
shall not be required provided the site remains in compliance with
subdivision's approved landscape plan as determined by the city.
         c.   Unless it is determined by the city that replacement is necessary
to preserve and/or restore riparian and wildlife habitat, removal of the
following trees shall not otherwise require replacement: black locust, poplar,

The property owner or property owner's representative shall remove, and if
required to meet the standards of these requirements, shall replace any
unhealthy or dead plant material immediately or as the planting season permits.
In all cases, maintenance and planting within public rights of way shall be
with approval from the public and/or private entities owning the property.
      2.   An initial and long term monitoring and maintenance plan shall be
developed prior to preliminary platting by the master developer and implemented
by the property owner for native revegetated areas and undisturbed areas within
the habitat areas of special concern (HASC), as identified in the habitat
mitigation plan, to gauge the success of revegetation efforts. A noxious weed
control plan was developed as part of the habitat mitigation plan and will be
implemented by the property owner to reduce and control invasive and noxious
weeds within the HASC.
   I.   Completion Time:
      1.   The administrator may authorize a delay in the completion of
planting if a surety for one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost of

11A-3-1 of this chapter, except as described below:
      1.   All required landscaped areas must be provided with an automatic
underground irrigation system except upland revegetation areas that are
intended to be naturalized (consisting of plant species that are indigenous to
or compatible with the area and do not require permanent irrigation). An
aboveground system or hand watering may be used on a temporary basis until such
areas are established and stabilized. Such areas are considered established and
stabilized when a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of the revegetated area can
exist without such supplemental watering.
      2.   The system shall be equipped with a reduced pressure backflow
prevention device.
      3.   All spray irrigation systems shall be designed and constructed to

to reduce direct and indirect overthrow and overflow onto nonpervious areas
(walks, drives, etc.).
      6.   Overhead or spray irrigation may be used to water turf, pastures,
slopes and berms, flowerbeds and hydroseeded areas.
      7.   Drip or subterranean irrigation shall be used to water trees (except
those in turf areas), shrubs and ground covers.
      8.   Use of nonpotable water (treated effluent or reuse water) for use in
the irrigation of lawn and plant material is required for public and common
areas when available. Such systems may be phased or transitioned from potable
water as treated effluent becomes available over time. Areas for transition
shall be identified on the irrigation plans. Such public and common areas
include:
         a.   Landscape along arterial and collector roadways.
         b.   Parks and sports fields.
         c.   Golf courses.
         d.   Community gardens.

separate from the potable water system and meets all applicable state and local
regulations. Stubs shall be provided to individual parcels to allow parcel
developers to tie into the system as needed to irrigate common areas within the
parcel. Such system may initially be installed as a dry line system to provide
future connection to the reuse system when reuse water becomes available.
      11.   All nonpotable water access points shall be clearly and permanently
labeled with markers indicating that the water is not safe for human
consumption.
      12.   Maintain all irrigation systems to ensure proper operation and
water conservation.

      1.   Definition: A transition zone or buffer area consists of horizontal
space (land) and vertical elements (plants, berms, fences, or walls). The
purpose of such buffer space is to physically separate and visually screen
adjacent land uses which are not fully compatible due to differing facilities,
activities, or different intensities of use, such as townhouses and a
convenience store, or a high volume roadway and residential dwellings.
      2.   Minimum Requirements:
         a.   When a nonresidential use abuts a residential use, a ten foot
wide by six foot high (10' x 6') landscaped buffer is required.
         b.   When a nonresidential parking lot abuts a residential activity, a
five foot wide by six foot high (5' x 6') landscaped buffer is required.
         c.   To conceal outdoor storage areas, trash receptacles, exposed
equipment associated with any commercial or industrial activity, and off street
loading when adjacent to or in view from a residential activity or public
street right of way, a five foot wide by six foot high (5' x 6') landscaped
buffer is required.
      3.   Materials:
         a.   All buffer areas shall be comprised of, but not limited to, a mix
of evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, and ground cover in which evergreen
plant materials comprise a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the total plant
material used.
         b.   Height requirements shall be accomplished with plant material,
with a fence or decorative wall.
         c.   The required buffer area shall result in an effective barrier
within three (3) years and be maintained such that sixty percent (60%) or more
of the vertical surface is closed and prevents the passage of vision through
it.
         d.   Chainlink fencing, with slats or otherwise, and cedar fencing is
prohibited for screening.
      4.   Major Roadways: Residential developments within Spring Valley,
including, but not limited to, subdivisions and multi-family developments,
shall be buffered from streets classified as collectors, arterials, and state
highways, as shown on exhibit 3-A of this section, or as determined by ACHD or
ITD, to protect residential communities from noisy, potentially dangerous, high
speed roads. The "buffer area" shall be defined as a common lot located between
the residential lots within the subdivision and the right of way line of the
adjacent roadway. This buffer is required as part of the common area open space
owned and maintained by a homeowners' association. Any landscaping proposed to
be within the public right of way shall not be included as a part of the buffer
area required below. The height for berming/fencing, except as noted below,
shall be measured from the elevation of the final grade of the adjacent roadway
(measured at the centerline) to the top of the proposed berming/fencing. The
required buffer area width, plantings, walls and fencing are described in
subsection L of this section.

Walls, fences, hedges, berms, and landscape may be used to screen parking areas
(chainlink and cedar fencing shall not be permitted). In the design of large
parking areas, arrange bays of parking spaces to be separated by landscape.
When parking lots occur on sloping terrain, step the parking lots to follow the
terrain rather than allowing the lot surface to extend above natural grade.
      2.   Parking Lot Landscape Strip: A landscape strip shall be provided
when a parking lot is located adjacent to a public right of way. The landscaped
strip shall serve to shield views of parked cars to passing motorists and

   T.   Landscaped Commercial Strips:
      1.   Landscaped strips shall be provided between all nonresidential
building development and roads classified as a local street to lend continuity
among different architectural styles, screen unsightly views, establish a
pleasing view for motorists, and create a safe and pleasant corridor for
pedestrians.
         a.   The landscaped strip shall be ten feet (10') wide minimum and
planted with one shade tree and ten (10) shrubs for every thirty five feet
(35') of street frontage. Two (2) ornamental or two (2) evergreen trees may be
substituted for one shade tree.
   U.   Wildfire Protection: The North Foothills are prone to wildfires.
Landscape design shall be reviewed and approved by the applicable fire
districts for consistency with the Spring Valley wildfire management plan
approved by the Eagle and Star fire district.
   V.   Incentives:
      1.   The administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by up to
five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed landscape
plan incorporates the retention of existing significant trees, particularly in
the interior of the site.
      2.   The administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by up to
five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed landscaping
exceeds the requirements of these guidelines by fifteen percent (15%) or more.
      3.   The administrator may reduce technical standards of parking lot
design where paving requirements conflict with the retention of significant
trees.
   W.   Alternative Methods Of Compliance:
      1.   Project Conditions: It is not the intent of these landscape
requirements to inhibit creative solutions to land use problems. Under certain
site conditions, a strict interpretation of requirements may be either
physically impossible or impractical. Alternative compliance is a procedure
that allows certain modifications to existing regulations within this chapter.
Requests for use of alternative landscaping schemes are justified only when one
or more of the following conditions apply:
         a.   The sites involve space limitations or unusually shaped parcels;
         b.   Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such
that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
         c.   Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer
yard is larger than can be provided; and
         d.   Safety considerations are involved.
      2.   Request For Alternative Method Of Compliance: The applicant must
provide the city with a written request if an alternative method of compliance
is proposed. The request shall state which requirement as set forth within this
chapter is to be modified, what project conditions stated within subsection W1
of this section justify using the proposed alternative, and how the proposed
alternative equals or exceeds said requirement.
      3.   Tree Fund: Persons applying for an alternative method of compliance
for relief from regulations that require all existing trees to remain on site
may elect to make a financial contribution to the Eagle city tree fund in lieu
of retaining all trees on site. The condition(s) which warrants the need for
the tree fund alternate method of compliance shall be specified in the
application submitted under subsection W2 of this section. If the application
is approved, the amount to be contributed by the applicant will be based upon
the total caliper inches of deciduous tree(s) removed from the site and the
total vertical feet of coniferous trees removed from the site. Cost per caliper
inch for deciduous trees and cost per vertical foot for coniferous trees shall
be determined by resolution of the city council. The applicant shall have the
right to review and consider the value determination, and following said
review, to reapply for other alternative methods of compliance, without
prejudice, in accordance with subsection W2 of this section.
   X.   Plan Preparation: Preparing a landscape plan requires special skills.
Landscape design involves more than a simple arrangement of plants with
irrigation; plants are not haphazardly placed in a way that fills up leftover
space. Landscape plans should reflect a theme so that site elements are
artfully and technically organized in a way that conveys meaning, coherence,
and spatial organization. Landscape should enhance the physical environment as
well as the project's aesthetic character. Therefore, landscape plans to be
submitted for approval shall be prepared by or under the responsible control of
a licensed landscape architect with said plans to be duly stamped to clearly
identify the preparer.
   Y.   Approved Plant List: This list is a suggested planting list for Spring
Valley. Other plant species and varieties will be considered and may be used
subject to SVDRC and city approval. ACHD and/or ITD approval will also be
required, as appropriate, if the plant is a street tree or is located within
the public right of way. An "X" in the far right column next to a tree
descriptor indicates the tree is allowed as a street tree. The list contains,
at the end of this subsection, plants intended for use in the establishment of
wetland/riparian and upland natural slope areas in accordance with the
recommendations contained in the habitat mitigation plan.

for any sign not specifically defined herein, the administrator shall use the
definition or classification within this chapter which most closely defines or
classifies any such sign.

the colors previously approved by the city are not changed.
   B.   Definitions: If conflict arises between any definition in this section

illuminate a site shall be arranged to reflect light away from the adjoining
property.
      3.   Lighting design shall promote dark sky principles which seek to
minimize light pollution and degradation of the nighttime visual environment by
incorporating lighting practices that minimize the amount and area of
illumination. Such practices include:
         a.   Providing lighting fixtures with lamp wattages designed for the
minimum level required by the use.
         b.   Providing energy efficient light sources.
         c.   Minimizing light trespass and glare by aiming fixtures downward
and shining light only where it is needed and providing appropriate shielding
as necessary to ensure that little or no unwanted light falls directly onto
adjacent property.

11A-4-4 SPECIFIC LAND USE STANDARDS:
Certain land uses may pose special circumstances that may have detrimental
effects on surrounding land uses and require specific conditions. In addition
to the other requirements of these standards, the following standards apply to
the uses listed in this chapter. If the proposed use does not meet the
standards contained herein, and is otherwise not subject to a conditional use
permit, then a conditional use permit shall be required.
   A.   Aggregate Processing, Asphalt, And Concrete Batch Plants: Aggregate
processing, asphalt, and concrete batch plants are permitted with a conditional
use permit subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The operator shall obtain all required permits and comply with all
applicable local, state and federal regulations.
      2.   The plant(s) shall be erected as a temporary use for the sole
purpose of providing asphalt or concrete to support the development of Spring
Valley. Aggregate mining operations are prohibited. Retail or wholesale sales
outside of Spring Valley shall be prohibited. The plant(s) and all associated
structures shall be removed from Spring Valley following cessation of
operations.
      3.   The plant operator shall treat all haul routes and parking areas
with an effective dust inhibiting surface. All truck tires shall be washed as
they leave the plant sites and pass onto paved access roads to minimize dust
associated with the tracking of mud on the paved road. Each load of aggregate
shall be wetted by a spray/washing system. To further control dust emanating
from trucks, the operator will cover all trucks with tarps.
      4.   Plant operations must be conducted employing portable equipment
which contain and utilize state of the art pollution control features. A
seventy foot (70') high silo will be the maximum allowable height for these
operations. All other activities shall be maintained within thirty five feet
(35') or less in height. The operator shall shield such activities by the use
of berms or by recessing operations below grade or by using similar measures to
reduce noise, visual impact, and dust on existing and future commercial and
residential developments within Spring Valley. Concrete operations shall
incorporate an automatic shutoff valve for the cement and fly ash fill tubes.
The shutoff valve will prohibit bulkers from overfilling silos and adding
particulate matter to the atmosphere.
      5.   The operator shall take such steps as are necessary to mitigate the
visual, noise, dust, and any other impacts on nearby residential and/or
commercial development related to the aggregate processing plants, including
the primary processing plants, the ready mixed concrete and asphaltic concrete
plants. The operator shall comply with the following:
         a.   Prior to startup, all plant facilities shall be shielded, both
visually and audibly through berming, walls, and/or recessing such facilities
below ground level from the existing and future residential and commercial
development. The maximum noise level at the property line shall be seventy (70)
dB. See also buffer area and screening requirements in
chapter 3 of this title.
         b.   The operator shall pave or treat all access roads, haul roads and
parking areas with an effective dust inhibiting surfacing. The operator shall
submit a plan to the city showing planned treatment of all access roads, haul
roads, and parking areas.
         c.   The operator shall install and utilize an effective truck spray/
washing system at the plant site exit. All trucks will be washed as they leave
the plant site. The operator shall clean the access road(s) at a frequency that
effectively controls material buildup and associated dust or other hazards.
         d.   The operator shall at all times keep the plant sites and
excavation sites free from the accumulation of waste materials, rubbish, debris
and toxic or hazardous materials caused by his/her operations and operations of
any subcontractors.

businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the council finds that regulations regarding personal wireless
facilities, spires, poles, antennas, steeples, towers, and other such
structures are necessary in order to:
            (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication
services to the residents and businesses of the city;
            (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of spires, poles, antennas,
steeples, towers, and other such structures through careful design and sitting
standards;
            (3)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from spire,
pole, antenna, steeple, tower, and other such structures' failure, through
structural standards and setback requirements; and
            (4)   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and
buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to
reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community, like church
steeples, windmills, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, light standards,
flagpoles, or trees.
      2.   Towers And Personal Wireless Facilities In Zoning Districts:

            (1)   Personal wireless facilities may be permitted to be attached
to city-owned infrastructure/buildings, existing light standards and power line
support devices (or replacement equivalent of same height) provided, however,
the antenna(s) are either flush mounted or mounted in a manner that provides
minimum visual impact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all provisions of this
subsection S shall be applicable to wireless antennas located on city-owned
infrastructure/buildings, existing light standards and power line support
devices.
            (2)   Personal wireless facilities shall be camouflaged or
concealed, not readily identifiable as such, designed to be aesthetically
compatible with existing and proposed uses on the site in the public/semipublic

proposed tower or antenna cannot be accommodated on an approved tower or
building within the required search radius due to one or more of the following
reasons:
            (1)   Unwillingness of another tower or facility owner to entertain
shared use.
            (2)   The proposed collocation of an existing tower or facility
would be in violation of any local, state or federal law.
            (3)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
            (4)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
            (5)   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional
engineer.
            (6)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate
the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, or
other professional qualified to provide necessary documentation.

11A-5-6: Loading Space Requirements
11A-5-1 PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   This chapter provides standards for parking and loading facilities to
ensure adequate parking areas for various uses, minimize traffic hazards and
congestion, promote vehicular and pedestrian safety and efficient land use, and
mitigate impacts on surrounding properties.
Parking is a key element of any development. An oversupply can result in excess
environmental and physical impacts while an undersupply can result in vehicles
intruding onto adjoining properties and neighborhoods. The goal is to find the
balance between providing adequate parking to support approved uses while
minimizing the negative effects of excessive land area or resources devoted to
parking. A well planned and executed parking program is essential to
establishing and maintaining a human scale environment that emphasizes parking
efficiency over parking supply.
Shared parking is encouraged and is a critical factor in the design and success
of a mixed use project such as Spring Valley. A shared parking program versus
traditional parking standards reduces parking requirements, enhances community
character and vitality, increases streetscape appeal, reduces impervious
surface area and decreases stormwater and pollution runoff, reduces the "urban
heat island effect", reduces conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, and
provides better pedestrian flow and connectivity.
   B.   In the interpretation of this chapter, the following shall govern:
      1.   Parking For Uses Not Listed: Parking spaces for other permitted or
conditional uses not listed herein shall be determined by the administrator.
Among the factors for determining the number of spaces to be required for a use
not listed herein, the administrator shall compare the proposed use with a use
which has similar traffic generating characteristics as outlined in the most
recent version of the Institute Of Transportation Engineers "Trip Generation
Manual".
      2.   Fractional Numbers: Fractional numbers shall be increased to the
next whole number.
      3.   More Than One Use Conducted On A Site: When more than one use is
conducted on a site, the total number of parking spaces shall be the sum of the
requirements for each use unless shared parking is approved.
      4.   Parking Requirements Based On Square Footage: When computing parking
requirements based on the amount of square footage in buildings, all
calculations shall be on a gross floor area (gfa) basis, unless specifically
stated otherwise.
      5.   Parking Based On Seating: When the parking requirements are based on
seating and the seating consists of benches or pews, each twenty four (24)
linear inches of bench or pew shall be considered one seat.
      6.   Parking Based On Employees: For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on the number of employees, calculations shall be for the
largest number of persons working on any single shift.
      7.   Residential Parking: Driveways may be used to satisfy minimum on
site parking requirements, beyond the covered parking requirements, for
residential dwellings, provided that sufficient length is available to satisfy
the minimum design standards. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-5-2 APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   No building or structure shall be erected, substantially altered, or
its use changed unless permanently maintained off street parking and loading
spaces have been provided in accordance with the provisions of this title.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter, except where there is a change of use,
shall not apply to any existing building or structure. Where a new use involves
no additions or enlargements, there shall be provided as many such spaces as
may be required by this title.
   C.   Whenever a building, structure, or use, constructed or changed in use
after the effective date hereof, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number
of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise to
create a need for an increase in the number of existing parking spaces per this
title, additional parking spaces shall be provided so that the existing
building, structure, or use, and proposed enlargement or change in use, shall
then and thereafter comply with the full parking requirements set forth herein.
   D.   The parking requirements in section
11A-5-5 of this chapter represent general parking standards for individual uses
under which all proposed development will be evaluated. Requirements for uses
not specifically listed shall be determined by the administrator based on uses
with similar traffic generation characteristics as outlined in the most recent
Institute Of Traffic Engineers (ITE) "Trip Generation Manual". Parking includes
garage and carport spaces.
   E.   Parking lots shall be screened from adjacent uses, streets and pathways
by walls, plantings, earth berms or a combination thereof pursuant to the
screening requirements in
chapter 3 of this title. Where on street parking is provided adjacent to the
use it serves, it shall count toward the parking requirement for the use.
   F.   Consideration should be given to providing spaces to accommodate
alternative forms of transportation such as, for example, motorcycles, motor
scooters and golf carts. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-5-3 DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Surfacing And Striping: Surfacing and striping except as approved by
the administrator, or as allowed below, all parking and loading facilities
shall be surfaced (paved) with asphalt or concrete, striped and marked to
clearly define access lanes, standard, compact and handicapped parking spaces,
and internal circulation movements. The following uses may have unpaved parking
areas:
      1.   Aggregate processing plants.
      2.   Equestrian centers/riding academies.
      3.   Sports fields (overflow parking).
      4.   Agriculture.
      5.   Roadside stands.
      6.   Plant nurseries/sod farms (wholesale).
      7.   Maintenance facilities.
      8.   Carnivals and circuses.
      9.   Wineries and vineyards (depending on location to perpetuate an
agrarian character of the site).
      10.   Temporary construction offices/yards.
      11.   Temporary sales offices/trailers.
   B.   Drainage: All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper
drainage of surface water to prevent the drainage of such water onto adjacent
properties or walkways. Drainage plans shall be reviewed and approved by the
city engineer and, for any site abutting a public street, such plans shall be
reviewed and approved by the Ada County highway district, or highway district
having jurisdiction.
   C.   Access: Off street parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering
room so that all vehicles may enter an abutting street in a forward direction.
The backing of a motor vehicle onto a public street from a parking area shall
be restricted or prohibited, except for residential properties along local
roadways. Access driveways for parking areas or loading spaces shall be located
in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such area shall be clearly
visible by a pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or driveway from a
public or private street.
   D.   Maintenance: The owner of parking facilities shall be responsible to
continually maintain the parking facilities in compliance with approved site
plans and shall be free of litter and debris.
   E.   Compact Spaces: Shall be designed consistent with section
11A-5-4-2 of this chapter.
   F.   Location: Off street parking areas should be located on the sides or
rear of buildings instead of the front. When parking areas are located in the
front of buildings, they should be adequately screened pursuant to
chapter 3 of this title. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-5-4 ADDITIONAL PARKING REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS:
11A-5-4-1: LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES:

11A-5-4-3: JOINT AND OFF SITE PARKING:
The parking requirements may be met by the use of joint and/or off site parking
facilities. Alternatives to the parking requirements contained herein will be
considered to:
   Avoid the visual intrusion and heat build up that results from large paved
areas.
   Ensure the efficient use of land.
   Create an incentive to provide pedestrian friendly development.
   The administrator may authorize the use of joint parking, off site parking
or a combination of the methods as described below:
   A.   Joint Parking:
      1.   The uses separately generate parking demands primarily during hours
when the other uses are not in operation and the parking spaces serve the uses
without conflict;
      2.   The peak hours of parking demand from the uses shall generally not
coincide so that the peak demand will be less than the parking required;
      3.   The applicant provides documentation showing the parking demand will
be reduced if a public or private transit system serves the use;
      4.   A shared parking analysis has been submitted describing the nature
of the uses and the times when the uses operate so as to demonstrate the lack
of potential conflict;
      5.   A shared parking facility, if located on a site other than the site
where the uses are located, shall be located no further than that permitted in
subsection B, "Off Site Parking", of this section;
      6.   The owners of the parcels or uses cooperatively establish and
operate the facilities;
      7.   The owners of the parcels execute an agreement, satisfactory to the
city attorney, which outlines the terms and conditions of the shared parking
arrangement. The agreement shall include the following:
         a.   A guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration in the
uses that will create a greater demand for parking;
         b.   A guarantee among the landowners for access to a use of the
shared parking facility;
         c.   A provision that the city may require parking facilities in
addition to those originally approved upon findings by the city council that
adequate parking to serve the uses has not been provided;
         d.   A provision stating that the city council may, for due cause and
upon notice and hearing, unilaterally modify, amend, or terminate the agreement
at any time; and
         e.   Any other information required to be documented on such agreement
by the city in an effort to assure compliance with this chapter. The agreement
must contain the legal description of both parcels and must be of sufficient
duration to ensure the continued use of the shared parking facilities. The city
may record the agreement in the office of the county recorder, or require the
applicant to do so.
   B.   Off Site Parking: The parking requirements may be met by locating the
required parking spaces on a separate parcel from the lot on which the
principal use is located. Off site parking may be approved only if:
      1.   The parcels containing the use and the off site parking are under
common ownership, or a cross parking easement agreement is provided;
      2.   The parcel to be used for parking is located as follows from the
building or use it is intended to serve (as measured along the sidewalk or
walkway available for public use from the primary entrance of the principal use
to the furthest parking space within the parcel):
         a.   Not more than three hundred feet (300') for residential uses;
         b.   Not more than seven hundred feet (700') in the community
commercial (CC), highway mixed use (HMU), and mixed use (MU) districts and for
all public/quasi-public uses;
         c.   Not more than one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') in the
village center (VC) and neighborhood commercial (NC) districts;
         d.   Not more than one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') for
employee parking on a daily basis where the vehicle is used occasionally,
regardless of the nature of employment;
      3.   The parcel to be used for parking is not separated or divided from
the building or use it is intended to serve by a freeway, expressway, highway,
or primary arterial;
      4.   The applicant satisfies the administrator that the use of the off
site parcel for parking will not be detrimental to public safety; and
      5.   The owner of the parcels executes an agreement or similar document,
satisfactory to the city attorney, which outlines the terms and conditions of
the off site parking use. The document must contain the legal description of
both the off site parcel and the parcel where the principal use is located and
must be of sufficient duration to ensure the continued use of the off site
parcel for parking. In order to provide record notice of the existence of the
off site parking arrangement, the applicant shall record the document in the
office of the county recorder and provide a copy of the document to the city.
   C.   Hotels And Resort Parking: The administrator may authorize a reduction
in the total number of required parking spaces for hotel/resort developments
pursuant to the joint and off street parking standards of this chapter. Such
reduction shall apply only to such uses as restaurants, retail stores,
amusements/recreational facilities and similar uses which are clearly ancillary
to the hotel. Required parking for supplementary uses shall be determined by a
shared parking analysis as described in subsection A, "Joint Parking", of this
section. In determining the parking requirement, the administrator shall
consider the following:
      1.   The characteristic of each use and the projected peak parking
demand, including hours of operation;
      2.   The potential reduction in vehicle movements afforded by
multipurpose use of spaces by employees or customers;
      3.   The potential reduction in vehicle trips afforded by multiple use of
the facilities by guests and customers; and
      4.   The extent to which the applicant can document the lack of potential
conflict among parking needs and facilities. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-5-4-4: PARKING DISABLED VEHICLES:
The parking of a disabled vehicle within a residential or commercial district
for a period of more than two (2) weeks shall be prohibited unless such vehicle
is stored in an enclosed garage or other accessory building. (Ord. 710, 1-14-
2014)
11A-5-4-5: BICYCLE PARKING:
One bicycle parking space within an approved rack shall be required for each
thirty (30) required automobile parking spaces or fraction thereof for office
and commercial developments. Multi-family residential developments shall
provide one bicycle rack space per each ten (10) units. Bicycle parking racks
shall be in a well lit area, and shall be designed in accordance with the
parking facility criteria of the "Bicycle-Pedestrian Design Manual For Ada
County" as prepared for the Ada County highway district with the exception that
bicycle racks do not have to be covered unless required by the design review
board, or planning and zoning commission or city council. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-5-5 SCHEDULE OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
In accordance with subsection
11A-5-1B of this chapter, parking spaces for other permitted or conditional
uses not listed herein shall be determined by the administrator. Among the
factors for determining the number of spaces to be required for a use not
listed herein, the administrator shall compare the proposed use with a use
which has similar traffic generating characteristics as outlined in the most
recent version of the Institute Of Transportation Engineers "Trip Generation
Manual".
For the purpose of this title, the following space requirements shall apply:

   A.   Action By Planning And Zoning Commission:
      1.   Within forty five (45) days after an application has been made and
following the notice requirements as set forth in section
11A-8-13 of this title, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a public
hearing to consider the application and make a recommendation to the city
council. The planning and zoning commission shall either recommend approval,
approval with conditions, or continue for further review, the PUMP application.
The planning and zoning recommendation shall be made within forty (40) days of
the date of the regular meeting at which the PUMP application is first
considered by the planning and zoning commission. If the PUMP is in substantial
conformance with the PADA and applicable provisions of this title, the planning
and zoning commission shall not unreasonably withhold a recommendation of
approval. If the planning and zoning commission finds that the PUMP submitted
does not reflect proportional progress of planning area requirements (such as
density, open space, community and neighborhood centers, etc.) in comparison to
the percentage of planning area already developed, the planning and zoning
commission may still proceed with processing the PUMP if the commission finds
that adequate conditions can be imposed on future PUMP applications to ensure
reasonable progress toward completion of the planning area requirements.
      2.   Upon making a recommendation the commission shall specify in
writing:
         a.   The ordinances and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The facts submitted with the application and presented establish
that:
            (1)   The PUMP substantially conforms with: the PADA and subsequent
amendments; this title; applicable master plans approved by the city; and/or
other applicable information reasonably relied on by the city necessary to
uphold the intent of the PADA and this title;
            (2)   Streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate
to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities, if any, will not
generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network;
            (3)   The proposed commercial/nonresidential development is
justified at the locations proposed and is consistent with the PADA;
            (4)   The information provided from the agencies having
jurisdiction over public facilities needed for the site indicate that adequate
public facilities exist, or are expected to be provided, to serve any and all
uses allowed within the PUMP area. The planning unit will be served, or is
conditioned to be served, by adequate public services.
         c.   A summary of the current status of overall planning area density,
open space, community centers, neighborhood centers, reassignment of densities,
and other adjustable factors as set forth in the PADA.
      3.   The recommendation, and the reasons for such recommendation, shall
be stated in writing by the administrator and forwarded to the applicant. The
administrator shall also forward the recommendation and the reasons for such
recommendation, together with a copy of the PUMP application, to the city
council for the city council's review and action.
   B.   Action By City Council:
      1.   Within fifteen (15) days after issuing a written decision, the
planning and zoning commission shall transmit its recommendation to the city
council. The city council shall follow notice and hearing requirements set
forth in section
11A-8-13 of this title. Within forty five (45) days after receipt of the
planning and zoning commission's recommendation, the city council may approve,
conditionally approve or deny a PUMP and shall specify in writing:
         a.   The PADA and subsequent amendments and this title; applicable
master plans approved by the city, and/or other applicable information
reasonably relied on by the city necessary to uphold the intent of the PADA and
this title;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         c.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
PUMP approval.
      2.   Approval shall not be construed to endorse a precise location of
uses or configuration of parcels. All conditions of the PUMP approval
established by the city council in the adopted findings of fact and conclusions
of law shall be reviewed and completed prior to or in conjunction with the
final plat approval.
      3.   Within ten (10) days after a decision has been rendered, the
administrator shall provide the applicant written notice of the action on the
request. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)

11A-8-4 CONDITIONAL USES:
11A-8-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION OF CONDITIONAL USE:
   A.   Purpose: It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of
uses are appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more
conventional uses possess characteristics of such unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, method of operation, circulation and public
facilities that each specific use must be considered individually.
   B.   Interpretation Of Conditional Use: Any use which is permitted as a
conditional use in a land use district under the terms of this title shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use in such land use district, but shall, without
further action, be considered a conforming one. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-8-4-2: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Application For Conditional Use Permit: An application for conditional
use permit shall be filed with the zoning administrator by at least one owner

the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and
other properties in the vicinity; and the relationship of the proposed use to
the Spring Valley master plan and/or the PADA.
   B.   Supplemental Information: Prior to granting a conditional use permit,
the city council may request studies from the planning staff or public agencies
concerning social, economic, fiscal and/or environmental effects on the
proposed conditional use.
   C.   Procedure For Approval Of Conditional Use Permit:
      1.   Public Hearing, Notice: Prior to granting a conditional use permit,
the planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing in which
interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. The public hearing
before the planning and zoning commission shall be scheduled to a date within
thirty (30) days of receipt of an application. Within forty five (45) days
after receipt of the application, the planning and zoning commission shall make
its recommendation to approve, conditionally approve or deny the application.
Notice shall be provided as required by section
11A-8-13 of this chapter.
      2.   Action By The Planning And Zoning Commission And City Council:
Within fifteen (15) days after the public hearing, the planning and zoning
commission shall transmit its recommendation of approval or denial to the city
council. Within forty five (45) days after receipt of the planning and zoning
commission's recommendation, the city council shall approve or deny the
application. The city council shall follow notice and hearing requirements set
forth in section
11A-8-13 of this chapter. The city council may approve, conditionally approve
or deny a conditional use permit under the conditions as herein specified and
considering such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of this title.
If the application is approved or approved with modifications, the city council
shall direct the zoning administrator to issue a conditional use permit listing
the specific conditions specified by the city council for approval.
Upon making its recommendation to the city council, and upon granting or
denying an application, the planning and zoning commission or city council, as
applicable, shall specify:
         a.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and

services; and/or
      7.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required

   E.   Transfer Of Permit: A conditional use permit is not transferable from
one parcel of land to another. Conditional use permits are an entitlement to
the specific property on which the approval was granted and upon any transfer
of title for the property the conditional use permit transfers to the new owner
(s) without further application or approval, provided, however, the new owner
(s) shall be bound by the same conditions of approval applicable to the
conditional use permit that was transferred.
   F.   Effect Of Issuance On Other Conditional Uses: A conditional use permit
shall not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other
conditional use permits.
   G.   Time Limitations, Extensions:
      1.   Once a conditional use is approved and exercised, said use may
continue without further temporal constraints, provided that the use complies
with its intended purpose, or city approved modifications thereafter, and does
not violate any codes, subject to the following:
         a.   An approved conditional use permit shall be valid for a term
approved and conditioned by the city council, which term may be perpetual.
         b.   An extension of the time limit for an approved conditional use
may be granted by the city council, at its sole discretion, without further
notice and hearing, if the following findings are made:

use permit violations on the subject property. If such violations exist, they
may be conditioned by the city council to be cured as a condition of the
extension of time;
            (2)   The conditional use, as previously approved, remains in the
best interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the city;
            (3)   There have been no significant changes to this title between
the date of conditional use approval and the date of the time extension request
that would require substantial modifications to the project;
            (4)   There are no hazardous conditions which have developed or
have been discovered on the project site; and

remain adequate. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-8-4-3: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES:
The planning and zoning commission/city council shall review the particular
facts and circumstances of each proposed conditional use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at
the proposed location:
   A.   Will, in fact, constitute a conditional use as established in
chapter 2 of this title for the land use district involved;
   B.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the Spring Valley master plan and/or this
title (including any applicable specific use standards described in
chapter 4 of this title) and/or the PADA;
   C.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area;
   D.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   E.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   F.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   G.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors;
   H.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
   I.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic
or historic feature of major importance. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-8-4-4: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:

11A-8-5-1: AUTHORITY TO GRANT VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority To Grant Variances: The city council may authorize, in
specific cases, such variance from the terms of this title as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary
hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in
the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   B.   Application And Standards For Variance: A variance from the terms of

peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same land use
district;
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same land use district under the terms of this title;
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same land use district.
A variance shall not be granted unless the city council makes specific findings
of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to the city council
which support conclusions that the above mentioned standards and conditions
have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-8-5-2: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the city council grant a variance to allow a use
not permissible under the terms of this title in the land use district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this title in said land use district. In granting any variance, the city
council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this title. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this title. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)

and zoning commission's recommendation, the city council shall approve or deny
the application. The city council shall follow the notice requirements provided
by section
11A-8-13 of this chapter. The city council may approve, conditionally approve
or deny a variance request under the conditions as herein specified and
considering such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of this title.
If the application is approved or approved with modifications, the city council
shall direct the zoning administrator to issue a variance listing the specific
conditions specified by the city council for approval.

         f.   Public lands;
         g.   Transportation or other community facilities, and vacant parcels,
held either publicly or privately which could provide future neighborhood
connection(s) to the above noted sites; and
         h.   In similar cases where deemed appropriate.
In addition, pathways may be required to connect sites other than those noted
above when there is evidence that a pedestrian/cyclist would otherwise be
forced to travel alongside a designated arterial roadway, or other roadway that
may be hazardous for nonmotorized forms of travel, in order to reach the
desired destination, or
   C.   Existing Neighborhoods: The placement of a path will be based upon
consideration of current residents of a neighborhood as well as future
residents. Based upon the following, the city may choose to acquire a pathway
in existing neighborhoods when:
      1.   The pathway would provide access to a major pathway element such as
the Boise River greenbelt.
      2.   The pathway would provide access to a nearby school or park.
      3.   A substantial lack of motorized access exists in the given area.
      4.   No alternative pathway is provided.
      5.   The pathway connects to adjacent subdivision pathways.
   D.   Pathway Design: While the city may exercise considerable discretion in
determining the design of pathways, the following minimum standards shall be
followed:
      1.   Paved Pathways: Neighborhood pathways within subdivisions which are
designed for primary use by the residents of the subdivision shall be a minimum
four feet (4') wide and shall be located within a minimum sixteen foot (16')
wide pedestrian access easement. Community pathways within Spring Valley that
are designed for primary use by residents, workers and visitors in Spring
Valley shall be a minimum of five feet (5') wide and shall be located within a
minimum of sixteen foot (16') wide pedestrian access easement. Regional
pathways such as within the Big Gulch Regional Park and pathways located
adjacent to major roadways shall be a minimum eight feet to ten feet (8' - 10')
wide and shall be located within a minimum twenty foot (20') wide pedestrian
access easement.
      2.   Unpaved Or Soft Pathways: Neighborhood pathway widths within
subdivisions may range from four feet (4') to six feet (6') and be located
within a minimum sixteen foot (16') wide access easement. Community pathways
within the community at large may range from five feet to six feet (5' - 6')
and be located within a minimum sixteen foot (16') wide access easement.
Regional trails are those trails along highly trafficked corridors or with
access to or from major trailheads and shall be a minimum six feet (6') to
eight feet (8') wide and shall be located within a minimum twenty foot (20')
wide pedestrian access easement.
      3.   Barriers: Barriers may be placed at the terminal ends of paths to
restrict use by motor vehicles while allowing use by bicycles, wheelchairs and
other modes of travel.
      4.   Setback: A minimum five foot (5') wide landscaped area/building and
fence setback, as measured from both edges of the path, shall be required, and
will be owned by either the abutting property owner(s) or a homeowners'
association unless accepted by a public entity. The five foot (5') wide
landscaped area on either side of the pathway may be decreased to a minimum of
two feet (2') wide (as measured from the edge of asphalt to the easement line)
when used in conjunction with a meandering pathway, however, the total width of
the landscape area shall not be less than ten feet (10') (i.e., 2 feet on 1
side of the path and 8 feet on the other). For safety purposes, planting
material in this area is limited to three feet (3') in height. The landscape,
fence and building regulations for this area shall be indicated by a note on
the plat.
      5.   Guides: The official design standards for pathways set forth in the
following manuals are to be used as guides: the "Bicycle Pedestrian Design
Manual" for Ada County, the "Design Guide For Accessible Outdoor Recreation",
and the "Guide For The Development Of Bicycle Facilities", or other nationally
recognized design standards.
      6.   Root Barrier: A root barrier shall be placed along the side of the
paved pathways when trees are planted within five feet (5') for class I and III
trees and four feet (4') for class II trees of a paved pathway to prohibit tree
roots from damaging the pathway surface. The root barrier shall consist of
black injection molded panels with a minimum of 0.085 inch wall thickness in
modules a minimum of twenty four inches long by twenty four inches deep (24" x
24"). Each panel shall have no less than four (4) vertical deflecting ribs of a
minimum 0.085 inch thickness protruding one-half inch (1/2") at ninety degrees
(90°) from the interior of the panel, spaced six inches (6") apart. A minimum
of nine (9) antilift tabs, three (3) each between the vertical ribs, shall be
integrated into each panel, measuring a minimum of 0.085 inch thickness and
protruding three- eighths inch (3/8") from the panel wall. An integrated
joining system shall be employed for instant assembly by sliding one panel into
the other. An alternative type barrier system of equal root penetrative
resistance may be considered on a case by case basis, subject to the approval
of the zoning administrator.
      7.   Crime Prevention Design Standards: In order to design for crime
prevention, the following design standards will be followed:
         a.   The use of "see through", open fencing, such as wrought iron, is
preferred, as it provides better visibility from adjacent homes or buildings.
View walls consisting of part wall (1/2 the height or less of the barrier) and
part fence are also acceptable. Solid fencing is discouraged.
         b.   Adequate lighting along regional trails may be provided per
chapter 3 of this title, as determined by Eagle city council and may be owned
and maintained by the city of Eagle once the path is turned over to the city
for maintenance.
         c.   The use of sharp corners and curves in the design of the paved
paths is discouraged.
      8.   Parking: Consideration shall be given to off street parking where
paths connect to popular destination points and nearby streets may become
congested with vehicles parked by pathway users. Where pathway links connect to
major public open space that require vehicular parking, the council may request
the developer to designate land to be purchased and maintained by the
appropriate public authority for public parking. Buffering of surrounding
residential uses shall be considered in the area for purchase.
   E.   Responsibility: The following provisions are intended to provide
guidance to those entities that are responsible for construction, maintenance
and/or liability for a pathway. Installation costs, which may include
construction of the pathways, are the responsibility of the developer. Regional
pathway construction costs are eligible for park impact fee credit.
      1.   Homeowners' Association:
         a.   Pathway systems, such as neighborhood and community pathways,
within a proposed subdivision providing access to private common space and/or
other amenities that are used solely by the residents of a subdivision shall be
the responsibility of the homeowners' association.
         b.   Where the residents of a subdivision will be the primary
beneficiaries of a pathway, and travel from adjoining neighborhoods will be
minimal, a homeowners' association may be required to take responsibility for
that path.
      2.   City Of Eagle: When location, length and design of a path have been
agreed upon by the city of Eagle and the developer, the city may accept
maintenance and liability for the pathway as designated in the Spring Valley
master parks, trails and open space plan, so long as the pathway is in good
condition and repair.
   F.   Sidewalk Design:
      1.   Sidewalks: An attached or detached sidewalk, a minimum five feet
(5') wide, shall be required on both sides of the street, except as provided
herein. Sidewalks may be eliminated on one or both sides of the street in
hillside areas to minimize topographic impacts and grading. Sidewalks on only
one side of the street may also be allowed in the following conditions:
         a.   The average width of lots, as measured at the street frontage
line or at the building setback line, is over one hundred fifty feet (150').
         b.   Within ER and RR neighborhoods.
         c.   On single loaded streets (that is, streets with lot access on
only 1 side of the street).
         d.   Sidewalks may be eliminated on both sides of a local street under
the following conditions and in compliance with Ada County highway district
standards. The applicant shall show a means of alternative pedestrian movement
in the area:
            (1)   When the existing slope of the hillside exceeds eighteen
percent (18%).
            (2)   When lots exceed an average of five (5) acres in size within
a plat. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)

water meter and shall be accessible to city staff.
            (4)   The property owner shall have the RPB inspected by an
appropriately licensed inspector and in accordance with state requirements
annually and shall provide the results of a passing inspection to the city.
Failure to complete the required inspection will result in a shutoff of water
service until completed.
            (5)   The city may assess a monthly service fee as part of the
water bill to cover costs associated with the testing and monitoring of the RPB
prevention assembly and administration of the city's cross connection control
policy.
         d.   Irrigation water may consist of a combination of surface water,
treated effluent, and groundwater as identified within the Spring Valley
irrigation and reuse master plan.
      2.   All development which is required to be served by a separate
pressurized irrigation system must be constructed, operated, and maintained in
accordance with this chapter and in accordance with the approved Spring Valley
irrigation and reuse master plan that may be amended from time to time. The
Spring Valley irrigation system shall be served by a permit to appropriate
water issued by the state of Idaho department of water resources (permit no.

plat. Construction plans are subject to approval by the responsible public
agencies and all construction plans shall be prepared in accordance with the
public agencies' standards or specifications. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-13D-2-2: GUARANTEE OF IMPROVEMENTS:
In lieu of the actual installation of the "required improvements" prior to the
city clerk signing the final plat, the city council may permit the subdivider
to provide a surety/financial guarantee of performance in one or a combination
of the following arrangements for those requirements which are over and beyond
the requirements of any other agency responsible for the administration,
operation and maintenance of the applicable public improvement:
   A.   Cash Deposit, Certified Check, Certificate Of Deposit, Surety Bond, Or
Other Method Accepted By The City Of Eagle: A cash deposit, certified check,
certificate of deposit, surety bond, or an irrevocable bank letter of credit,
in the amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the estimated
construction costs of the "required improvements" contained within the final
plat or public right of way shall be provided by the owner/developer and held
by the city until said construction is complete. Construction cost estimates
for the "required improvements" contained within a final plat or public right
of way shall be reviewed and approved by the city zoning administrator prior to
city acceptance of said surety. The surety initiation and extension fees shall
be established by resolution of the city council.
      In the case of cash deposits or certified checks, the subdivider may
provide for progressive payment out of the cash deposit or reduction of the
certified check, to the extent of the cost of the completed portion of the
"required improvement", in accordance with a previously entered into agreement.
In the case of a certificate of deposit or an irrevocable bank letter of
credit, the surety shall be reduced accordingly as construction of the
"requirement improvements" subject to such surety is completed. Within thirty
(30) days from the city's approval of any such "required improvement", the city
shall release such surety, in whole or part, as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.
   B.   Completion Time: All "required improvements" shall be completed within
one year from the date of acceptance of the surety/financial guarantee of
performance by the city for a plat. The zoning administrator may authorize a
delay in the completion of "required improvements" during the months of
November, December, January, February, and March due to weather conditions, if
at a minimum, the surety is extended for an amount of time equal to the delay
imposed by the zoning administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no final
occupancy permit will be issued for any residence or business, whichever is
applicable, until the sidewalk, sod, automatic irrigation, and street trees
required in section
11A-13D-1-6 of this article have been installed along the frontage of the lot
that said residence/business is located upon, unless an acceptable form of
financial assurance has been tendered and approved by the city. (Ord. 710, 1-
14-2014; amd. Ord. 924, 8-27-2024)
11A-13D-2-3: INSPECTIONS:
Before approving a final plat and construction plans and specifications for
"required improvements", the city may require an agreement between the
subdivider and the city council to provide for checking or inspecting the
construction and its conformity to the submitted plans. (Ord. 710, 1-14-2014)
11A-13D-2-4: FAILURE TO COMPLETE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT CONSTRUCTION:
In the event the subdivider shall, in any case, fail to complete such work
within the period of time as required by the conditions of the guarantee for
the completion of "required improvements", it shall be the responsibility of
the city council to proceed to have such work completed. In order to accomplish
this, the city council shall appropriate the cash deposit, certified check, or
irrevocable bank letter of credit, or may take such steps as may be necessary
to require performance by the surety company, and as may be included in a
written agreement between the city council and the subdivider. (Ord. 710, 1-14-

11B-2-2: MASTER LAND USE MAP AND LAND USE DISTRICTS:
The Master Land Use Map generally depicts the areas within the Avimor Planned
Development Zoning District where specific Land Use Districts are appropriate.
The Open Space Land Use District is appropriate anywhere within the Avimor
Planned Development Zoning District. Table 2.2 provides a comprehensive list of
each Sub-Use District allowed in each Land Use District. Table 2.1 provides
which land uses are allowed, conditionally allowed, and prohibited within each
Sub-Use District. In accordance with
11B-11B-3, a Subdivision Land Use Map shall be submitted and reviewed for
approval with each preliminary plat, which Subdivision Land Use will
specifically identify Sub-Use District(s), and the Density allocation included
in the preliminary plat area. The Land Use Districts within the Avimor Planned
Development Zoning District are:
   A.   Village Center District: The Village Center District is the heart of
the community and the main activity center where community, residential and
cultural activities occur. As described in Table 2.2, the allowed Sub-Use
Districts in the Village Center District include: Single Family Zero Lot Line
(SFZL), Single Family Special Lot (SFSL), Single-Family Attached (SFA), High

facilities, Vineyards and wineries, and residential uses. The HMU Sub-Use
District is designed to provide highway-oriented businesses as well as similar
and more intensive uses than the MU Sub-Use District. Commercial Sub-Use
Districts are intended to provide commercial facilities designed for use by
community or area residents that will provide most of the daily and weekly
support services that residents require on a regular basis.
   C.   Foothills Residential District: The Foothills Residential District
provides for residential neighborhood uses and supportive Accessory Uses such
as Farmers' Markets, Schools, Vineyards, Community Centers and other

emphasizes housing diversity. As described in Table 2.2, the allowed Sub-Use
Districts in the Village Residential District include: Single-Family Detached
(SF1, SF2, SF3) and Low-Density Multi-Family (MF1).
   E.   Village One District: The Village One District encompasses the existing
Avimor development area as designated on the Master Land Use Map. The Village
One District is subject to the standards set forth in Chapter 3A of this Title,
which ensures the existing Lots, uses, and structures within the Village One
District are conforming uses. As described in Table 2.2, the allowed Sub-Use
Districts in the Village One District include: Reserve (RE), Cottage (CO),
Phase One Mixed-Use (P1MU), and Community Services (CS). Sub-Use Districts
within the Village One District are designated on the Village One Land Use Map.
   F.   Open Space District: Open Space Sub-Use Districts consist of Community
Open Space (COS) and Regional Open Space (ROS) districts. Community Open Space
and Regional Open Space are allowed within any Land Use District.
      1.   Community Open Space: Community Open Space is land set aside for
recreation, Agriculture, habitat, vegetation, scenic, or similar uses and is
intended to primarily serve Avimor residents. Community Open Space may include
public, semi-public, and private recreational facilities, amphitheaters, Golf
Courses, Pathways and Trails, landscape zones in and adjacent to major roadways
including areas outside of a dedicated Right-of-Way, greenbelts, cultural,
community, educational, and quasi-public facilities, Equestrian Centers, and
trailheads, as well as parks, playfields and Natural Open Spaces. Agricultural
uses, such as Vineyards, wineries and plant nurseries, are considered Community
Open Space. Facilities and tracts of land owned by the Owners' Association are
also considered Community Open Space.
      2.   Regional Open Space: Regional Open Space is intended to serve both
Avimor residents and the general public and may be adjacent to, or provide
connection to, large scale regional open space. Regional Open Space may include

regional parks, and trail corridors. Regional Open Space may be owned and
maintained by the City, the Owners' Association, private parties, a land trust,
or other conservation group or entity. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)

11B-2-4: SETBACKS AND GENERAL LOT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS:
These standards are designed to ensure that development within Avimor Planned
Development Zoning District will produce a built environment of stable,
desirable character that is harmonious with existing and future development and
is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Master Land Use Map.
Centralized Water and Wastewater facilities are required for all subdivision
and Lot split applications in all Land Use Districts exceeding one (1) Dwelling
Unit per two (2) acres (where facilities are available).
   A.   General Setback Standards:
      1.   Minimum Sub-Use District Setbacks are outlined in Table 2.2.
Dwelling Units located in the HMU, MU, and NC Sub-Use Districts shall use the
Setback standards for the applicable district.
      2.   Dwelling Units that are stacked above non-residential uses shall use
the Setbacks of the non-residential Sub-Use District in which located.
      3.   Dwelling Units in the RR, ER, and SF1 Sub-Use Districts shall adhere
to the Setbacks outlined in Table 2.2.
      4.   Driveway length shall be a minimum nineteen (19) feet, or three (3)
to five (5) feet. Driveway length shall be measured from the back of sidewalk,
or back of curb if no sidewalk exists, or edge of pavement if no curb exists to
the garage. Front loaded driveways between nineteen (19) and twenty-two (22)
feet length that intersect with a sidewalk shall have a flared apron as shown
in Exhibit 2.1. No more than three consecutive Dwelling Units in a row shall
have front loaded driveways between three (3) to five (5) feet in length. There
shall be no such restriction for rear loaded Dwelling Units.

      5.   Bay windows, nooks, architectural pop-outs and appendages,
fireplaces, cabinets designed to screen utility meters and similar
architectural features shall encroach no more than two (2) feet into any
Setback, provided they remain at least three (3) feet from the side property
lines and ten (10) feet from the front property line, and do not increase the
living space within the home at the floor line. The maximum width of such
structures shall not exceed thirteen (13) feet in total for any facade.
      6.   Roof overhangs, cornices, and similar architectural features shall
encroach no more than two (2) feet into any Setback provided they remain at
least three (3) feet from the property line. Balconies must maintain the
Setback required for the structure to which they are attached and may not
extend into the required Setback area except on Lots where such balconies abut
a Golf Course, park area, common Open Space, or similar Open Space. In such
case balconies may extend into the Setback area toward the Open Space a
distance equal to fifty percent (50%) of the required Setback provided they
remain at least five (5) feet from the property line. Balconies on multi-family
Dwelling Units may also overhang a sidewalk or Common Area up to five (5) feet
so long as they are elevated in the vertical air space over and above such
sidewalk or Common Area by a minimum of ten (10) feet.
      7.   Interior Fire Escapes are encouraged. Exterior Fire Escapes shall
encroach no more than 6 feet into any Setback provided they remain at least
three (3) feet from the property line. Exterior Fire Escapes are allowed in the
side or rear yards only.
      8.   Accessory Dwelling Units, shall comply with the Setback and height
standards for the district they are located in as set forth in Tables 2.2 or as
otherwise described in Chapter 4 of this Title.
      9.   Accessory structures shall not be permitted in the addressed front

Setback standards of the applicable residential district.
      10.   Attached patio covers, awnings, carports, trellises, and similar
structures and architectural elements within residential districts shall
encroach no more than two (2) feet into the front Setback and shall encroach no
more than fifteen (15) feet into the side and rear Setbacks provided they
remain at least five (5) feet from the property line. These Setbacks are
measured from the supporting posts; however, overhangs may extend up to three
(3) feet from a property line. Such structures must remain open without the use
of siding, screens or other enclosures. Enclosed structures must conform to the
Setback standards for the principal dwelling.
      11.   Awnings, trellises, and similar structures and architectural
elements in non-residential districts may overhang a sidewalk up to six (6)
feet so long as they are elevated in the vertical air space over and above such
sidewalk by a minimum of eight (8) feet and do not negatively impact a tree
canopy.
      12.   Swimming pools shall only be permitted in the side or rear yard
areas. Swimming pools shall maintain a minimum Setback of three (3) feet from
the water's edge to property lines and easements. Any Setback, if required,
from the dwelling or other Buildings on the same Lot shall be determined by the
City Building Department.
   B.   Building Heights:
      1.   Building heights shall be measured from the finished floor elevation
closest to the finished grade to the top of the roof. The height of the
Building may follow the slope of the contour of the Lot (grade adaptive
architecture). Top of roof means ridgeline or the highest point of any
architectural element concealing roof top equipment, excluding chimneys and
vents. Height restrictions are not intended to limit the number of stories.
Height restrictions do not apply to chimneys, which are governed by the
building code.
      2.   Themed, non-habitable structures or parts of structures, such as
Church steeples and clock towers, shall be allowed up to fifty (50) feet in
height in the VCOM, NC, and all residential Sub-Use Districts and shall be
allowed up to sixty (60) feet in height in the CC, HMU, and MU Sub-Use
Districts except where the height of such structures will constitute a hazard
to the safe landing and takeoff of aircraft at an established airport.
      3.   Refer to Tables 2.2 for maximum building heights.
   C.   Residential Density:
      1.   Residential Density, as shown on Table 2.2, shall be determined on a
gross area basis. Gross area includes the entire area being developed together
with all Right-of-Way prior to any Right-of-Way dedication.
   D.   Refuse Storage/Disposal:
      1.   Every Parcel with a multi-family or commercial use shall have a
trash receptacle on the premises. The trash receptacle shall be of sufficient
size to accommodate the trash generated by the use and must be a minimum of
fifty (50) feet from any single-family residential property. The receptacle
shall be screened from public view on at least three sides by a solid wall or
structure that is constructed to be a minimum of one foot (1') above the height
of the trash and/or recycling receptacle within the collection area measured
from the finished surface and on the fourth side by a solid gate not less than
the height of the trash and/or recycling receptacle. Trash enclosures and
containers shall comply with the design standards set forth in Chapter 3 of
this Title. Trash receptacles for single-family homes must be stored within the
enclosed garage or screened from the Right-of-Way behind a fence.
Notwithstanding anything herein, the following shall be exempt from the
Setbacks of this subsection: all uses within the VC district, Live/Work uses,
and any Dwelling Units that are stacked above non-residential uses. However,
the trash receptacle must be located in the rear of the property and not
encroach into any site triangle.
   E.   Hillside Development and Grade-Adaptive Housing:
      1.   Guidelines for hillside development and grade-adaptive housing are
contained in the Avimor Grading Guidelines and Hillside Development Standards.
   F.   Side And Rear Yards For Nonresidential Uses Abutting Residential
Districts:
      1.   Nonresidential Buildings or uses shall not be located or constructed
closer than twenty feet (20') to any Lot line of a residential Sub-Use
District, unless specifically called out in Chapter 4 of this Title; except
that the minimum yard requirements may be reduced to no less than ten feet
(10') of the requirement if acceptable to the City Design Review Board.

provisions set forth in this Chapter contain a listing of objectives applied to
each application, and a listing of matters that shall be considered by the
Design Review Board. The objectives are separated into two (2) sections: site
design and building design. Specific aspects of design should be examined to
determine whether the proposed development will provide a desirable environment
for its occupants as well as for its neighbors, and whether, aesthetically, the
composition, materials, textures and colors meet the intent of this Chapter.
The Design Review Board shall consider the following criteria in reviewing the
application:
      1.   Site Design Objectives: The site plan design shall minimize impact
of traffic on adjacent streets, provide for the pedestrian, and provide parking
in conformity with the applicable design;
         a.   The functional relationship of the structures and the site in
relation to its surroundings;
         b.   The impact and effect of the site development plan on traffic
conditions on contiguous streets and adjoining properties or neighborhoods;
         c.   The site layout with respect to separation or integration of
vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic patterns;
         d.   The arrangement and adequacy of off-street parking facilities
relative to access points, Building location and total site development to
prevent traffic conflict or congestion;
         e.   The location, arrangement and dimensions of truck loading ramps,
docks, and bays and vehicle service facilities;
         f.   The access, Parking Lot, and interior roadway illumination plans
and hours of operation;
         g.   The required driver, pedestrian and bicycle sight distance
requirements of the project and their relationship to adjacent streets,
driveways and properties;
         h.   The coordination of the site development with planned right of
way alignments, acquisitions and street improvements;
         i.   The graphic delineation of traffic circulation patterns to avoid
confusion, congestion and conflicts;
         j.   The continued maintenance of traffic, parking and lighting
systems;
         k.   The protection of views and vistas in relation to urban design
and aesthetic considerations; and
         l.   The provision of safe pedestrian and bicycle connections between
neighborhoods and commercial areas.
      2.   Site Landscaping: The site landscaping shall minimize impact on
adjacent properties through the proper use of screening with sound and sight
buffers, and unsightly areas shall be concealed or screened and the Design
Review Board shall consider:
         a.   The location, height, and materials of walls, fences, hedges and
screen plantings to ensure harmony with adjacent development;
         b.   The location and type of new plantings, with due regard to
preservation of specimen and landmark trees, and to maintenance of all
plantings;
         c.   The providing of screen plantings or other screening methods
reasonably required to conceal Outdoor Storage areas, trash receptacles,
service areas, truck loading areas, Utility Buildings and other unsightly
developments;

(Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-3-7: LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER AREA REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Overview and Intent: The built landscape within Avimor will embrace the
surrounding natural landscape as the foundation for design. Preservation and
integration of native vegetation and materials is critical to preserving a
sense of place. It also provides an opportunity to enhance habitat and to
create a seamless transition to the more urban environments which bind the
development together. This transition will occur in accordance with the
following practices:
      1.   Preserve native vegetation and plants in all undisturbed areas;
      2.   Plant selection shall be from the preferred plant list, see Section
11B-3-7(W) of this Chapter, appropriate to varied site locations and land uses;
      3.   When adjacent to undisturbed natural features, blend structures with
the existing terrain through landscape design and selection of plant material;
      4.   Use plant materials to reduce Building scale and mass to help
integrate the structure into its surroundings;
      5.   Protect areas disturbed by construction from erosion by revegetation
as soon as possible after completion of such activity as seasonal conditions
allow;
      6.   Climate conditions and Building orientation shall guide the type and
location of trees and shrubbery;
      7.   Water conservation and sustainability shall guide plant location and
groupings, and mulching shall be encouraged to preserve moisture in planting
beds;
      8.   Mixed Use/Commercial planting may include deciduous trees of a
minimum of a two (2") inch caliper in size and character to provide shading for
pedestrians, roadways, and Buildings during the summer, and conversely, to
enable solar gain during winter months;
      9.   Windbreaks and buffering of noise and light will be considered in
the design and placement of trees and shrubbery;
      10.   Except for fire-defensible areas, undeveloped land and undisturbed
Lot Areas shall not be irrigated or landscaped, other than for enhancement or
restoration of drought resistant plants and grasses; and
      11.   Where appropriate, new landscaping should be less or nonpalatable
to wildlife as outlined in Section 11B 3-7 W, Plant Section Guide.
   B.   Landscape as Percent of Site:
      1.   Landscaping shall cover a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the
property on multi-family residential developments. Hardscape plaza areas, such
as decorative concrete/paver patios that are integrated into the design of the
landscaped area, may be included in the fifteen percent (15%) landscape
coverage requirement.
      2.   Landscaping shall cover a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the
property on all other developments. Hardscape plaza areas, such as decorative
concrete/paver patios that are integrated into the design of the landscaped
area, may be included in the ten percent (10%) landscape coverage requirement.
      3.   All landscape improvements required in this Section shall count
toward fulfillment of the above minimum percentages.

(35') of street frontage. Two (2) ornamental or two (2) evergreen trees may be
substituted for one shade tree.
   R.   Wildfire Protection: The North Foothills are prone to wildfires.
Landscape design shall be reviewed and approved by the applicable fire
districts for consistency with the Avimor wildfire management plan approved by
the Eagle fire district.
   S.   Incentives:
      1.   The Administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by up to
five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed landscape
plan incorporates the retention of existing significant trees, particularly in
the interior of the site.
      2.   The Administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by up to
five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed landscaping
exceeds the requirements of these guidelines by fifteen percent (15%) or more.
      3.   The Administrator may reduce technical standards of Parking Lot
design where paving requirements conflict with the retention of significant
trees.
   T.   Alternative Methods Of Compliance:
      1.   Project Conditions: It is not the intent of these landscape
requirements to inhibit creative solutions to land use problems. Under certain
site conditions, a strict interpretation of requirements may be either
physically impossible or impractical. Alternative compliance is a procedure
that allows certain modifications to existing regulations within this Chapter.
Requests for use of alternative landscaping schemes are justified only when one
or more of the following conditions apply:
         a.   The sites involve space limitations or unusually shaped Parcels;
         b.   Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such
that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
         c.   Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer
yard is larger than can be provided; and
         d.   Safety considerations are involved.
      2.   Request For Alternative Method Of Compliance: The applicant must
provide the City with a written request if an alternative method of compliance
is proposed. The request shall state which requirement as set forth within this
Chapter is to be modified.
      3.   Tree Fund: Persons applying for an alternative method of compliance
for relief from regulations that require all existing trees to remain on site
may elect to make a financial contribution to the Eagle City tree fund in lieu
of retaining all trees on site. If the application is approved, the amount to
be contributed by the applicant will be based upon the total caliper inches of
deciduous tree(s) removed from the site and the total vertical feet of
coniferous trees removed from the site. Cost per caliper inch for deciduous
trees and cost per vertical foot for coniferous trees shall be determined by
resolution of the City Council. The applicant shall have the right to review
and consider the value determination, and following said review, to reapply for
other alternative methods of compliance.
   U.   Plan Preparation: Preparing a landscape plan requires special skills.
Landscape design involves more than a simple arrangement of plants with
irrigation; plants are not haphazardly placed in a way that fills up leftover
space. Landscape plans should reflect a theme so that site elements are
artfully and technically organized in a way that conveys meaning, coherence,
and spatial organization. Landscape should enhance the physical environment as
well as the project's aesthetic character. Therefore, landscape plans to be
submitted for approval shall be prepared by or under the responsible control of
a licensed landscape architect with said plans to be duly stamped to clearly
identify the preparer.
   V.   Grading and Drainage:
      1.   Drainage control: Site grading should control drainage. Grading
should also be designed to screen parking areas, service areas, or other
visually unattractive areas.
      2.   Storm Water Basins: Landscaped areas may be used for Storm Water
Basins to retain and/or detain stormwater. Basins must be designed to retain
and/or detain all water resulting from a 1% Annual Chance Flood, one-hour storm
event and limit discharge to pre development discharge rates. The overall
stormwater basins must also be designed so as not to cause damage to
landscaping or other improvements. The maximum depth of a Storm Water Basin
exposed to direct public view is four feet (4') in depth without a safety
bench. For deeper ponds a ten foot (10') wide safety bench will be required to
be added with top of bench at six inches (6") below design normal surface
elevation. Slopes above the bench shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1).
If a wet pond is designed as the Storm Water Basin than slopes below the bench
shall not exceed two to one (2:1). Where space is limited, retaining walls may
be used. Such walls must complement the Building architecture. Storm Water
Basin design must comply with the Local Highway Department design standards.
      3.   Runoff: Owners/occupants may not allow runoff from their Parcel to
drain onto adjacent Parcels, except through common drainage easements areas.
      4.   Grading and Building access: Site grading may not block access to
the site, internal vehicular circulation, and existing structures.
   W.   Plant Selection Guide:
      1.   This list is the preferred planting list for Avimor. Other plant
species and varieties may be considered with an alternative form of compliance
if approved by the Avimor Design Review Committee and the City Design Review,
as appropriate, if the plant is a street tree or is located within the public
Right-of-Way. Additions to the below plant selection guide can be approved by
the Administrator.

                                    otherwise known as "stake" Signs or "wire
                                    stake" Signs are not stable and typically
                                    are susceptible to being blown over by
                                    wind and oftentimes do not remain
                                    vertical. Common types of nonrigid yard/
                                    lawn Signs are corrugated plastic, fold
                                    over cardboard, and poster type which are
                                    attached to a light metal stand with less
                                    than one-fourth inch thickness, or
                                    lattice type wood stakes, which are
                                    inserted into the ground.The metal stands
YARD SIGN (NONRIGID):               are usually an "H" or "I" type. The "H"
                                    type stand is shaped like an "H" and two
                                    (2) of the prongs insert into the Sign,
                                    or the Sign is attached to the two, and
                                    the other two prongs are inserted into
                                    the ground. The single or double crossbar
                                    between the two prongs adds minimal
                                    strength and makes the entire stand one
                                    single unit. The "I" type stand is
                                    essentially an "H" stand without a
                                    crossbar linking the prongs.

   C.   General Regulations For All Signs:
      1.   The following shall apply to Signs in all zoning districts:
         a.   Message Substitution Allowed: A noncommercial message of any type
may be substituted, in whole or in part, for the message displayed on any Sign
for which the Sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration
of message content. This provision applies to all Signs allowed under this
Title. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional
approval, permitting, registration or notice to the City. The purpose of this
provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial message or any
other noncommercial message. This provision prevails over any more specific
provision to the contrary.
         b.   Permits Required: No Sign, unless specifically stated in this
Chapter, shall be erected, placed, attached, altered, displayed, or secured to
the ground, any Building, or any structure, until a permit for such Sign,
including and applicable electrical permits, and any other permit required by
federal, state or local law has been issued by the City of Eagle. An
application for a Sign permit may be obtained from the City's Planning
Department and/or Building Department. A permit will be issued if a proposed
sign conforms to this Title. Incorrect information shall be grounds for
revocation of a permit. Sign permits issued are site specific and Building
specific, and are not transferrable to another site or another Building.
         c.   Permit Expiration: If the work authorized by a permit under this
Title has not been commenced within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void.
         d.   Fees: A Sign permit fee, as established by resolution of the
Council, shall be paid upon issuance of a Sign permit.
         e.   Undefined or Unclassified Signs: To determine applicable
regulations for any Sign not specifically defined herein, the Administrator
shall use the definition or classification within the Title which most closely
defines or classifies any such Sign.
         f.   Architectural Compatibility: The number, area, and height of
Signs as outlined in this Title is intended to be maximum standards which do
not necessarily ensure architectural compatibility. Therefore, in addition to
the enumerated maximum standards, the City shall give consideration to a Sign's
relationship to the overall appearance of the subject property as well as the
surrounding area, through a design review process.
         g.   Materials and Appearance: It is the intent of this Chapter to
encourage interesting, creative, readable, effective, uncluttered, and well-
maintained signage. Sign materials and appearance shall be complementary to the
Building architecture and colors. Throughout the project an efficient palette
of materials is to be employed in the signage elements and the structures into
which the signage is integrated per the design guidelines as stated in this
Chapter. Depending on location and feasibility, materials may be used in their
natural state or be replicated in quality faux finishes.
         h.   Stricter Standards Prevail: Nothing in this Title is intended, no
shall be construed, to permit the erection, construction, enlargement,
alteration, or maintenance of any Sign at any place or in any manner unlawful
under any other federal, state, or local law. When any part of this Chapter
conflicts with another provision of federal, state, or local law, the provision
that establishes the stricter standard shall control.
   D.   Placement Restrictions:
      1.   No permanent Signs shall project into or over the public right-of-
way (existing or proposed), into any utility or access easement, or within any
vision triangle, unless otherwise specifically stated in this Title.
      2.   The lowest portion of any Sign which extends over an area intended
for pedestrian use shall not be less than eight feet above finished grade.
      3.   Any Sign placed on a sidewalk or other public right of way, where
permitted by this Title, shall comply with this Chapter and applicable
provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
      4.   Signs and their location shall not obstruct or interfere with
traffic, sighting distance, signals and public Signs.
      5.   Unless otherwise allowed in this Chapter, no person shall post or
cause to be posted, attached or maintained any Sign upon any tree, light pole,
or any utility pole or structure; any fence, railing or wall, unless otherwise
specified in this Title; or any sidewalk within the right-of-way or a sidewalk
easement, curb, gutter, or street, except for house numbers or fire lane
designation.
      6.   No Sign shall be erected as to block, partially block, or interfere
in any way with a required means or exit from any Building nor with any window.
No Sign shall block, interfere, or otherwise, hinder pedestrian or vehicular
traffic on a public sidewalk, a public thoroughfare, a fire lane easement, or a
driveway required to access parking.
      7.   Support and Attachment: All Signs shall be constructed and installed
in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, the registered design
professional, or the Sign contractor, whichever is applicable and the most
stringent. Signs that project from the face of a Building and that require
structural support shall be designed that the structural support is integral to
the overall architecture of the Sign and Building.
      8.   Change of Face, Copy and/or Logo on Signs: For Signs conforming to
this Chapter, excepting legal Signs, a permit shall not be required for a
change of face, copy and/or logo on any such Sign, provided that the Sign
structure is not changed in any way and provided that the colors previously
approved by the City are not changed. However, Signs relocated to another site
location or Building will require new Sign approvals and permits.
      9.   License Required: No person shall install, erect, repair or maintain
any Sign that requires a permit for electrical or structure unless such person
is a licensed contractor as required by the State of Idaho. Such person shall
provide a contractor registration number to the building department prior to
the issuance of a Sign permit.
      10.   Traffic Control Signs: Traffic control Signs conforming to the
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices that are installed or approved by the
highway department.
      11.   Nonconforming Signs: All Signs shall conform to this Title upon any

or upon any change in the face or copy of the Sign for the business to which
such Sign pertains if the use associated with the business is changed, except
as provided for within subsection, "Historic Signage", of this Section.
   E.   Exempt Signs: The provisions and requirements of this Title shall not
apply to the following Signs and attention attracting devices, except that all

(Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-3A-3: ROAD STANDARDS:
   A.   The design of the on-site vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation
system for the Village One District is focused on the following objectives:
      1.   Meeting the intent of the Ada County Highway District (ACHD) design
standards and guidelines;
      2.   Meeting the response and access needs of emergency service
providers;
      3.   Providing an efficient and safe network of vehicular, bicycle, and
pedestrian facilities that support the multi-modal vision of the development;
      4.   Supporting the planned land uses of the development; and
      5.   Blending into, respecting, and preserving the natural rural
environment.
   B.   The Village One District street standards are based on ACHD standards.
However, given the diverse character of the Village One District there may be
modifications or exceptions based on location and site-specific conditions that
will be proposed to ACHD early in the preliminary platting process and will
address these unique requirements of each development phase. The authorized
roadway standards for the Village One District include:
      1.   Reserve And Cottage Residential Streets: These standards are
appropriate in the RR and CR Sub-Use Districts.
         a.   ACHD sections for:
            (1)   Two-lane Collector;
            (2)   Two-lane, residential collector; and
            (3)   Two-lane, minor local.
         b.   Modifications/Exceptions:
            (1)   Option to replace curb and gutter with ribbon curb in large
Lot Areas with moderate grades;
            (2)   Separated (one-way) travel lanes in steeply-sloped areas with
twenty foot (20 foot) wide lanes to meet emergency service provider
requirements;
            (3)   Single, separated pedestrian facility in large Lot Areas; may
be located in ACHD right-of-way or within an easement adjacent to street;
            (4)   The twenty-nine foot (29') reduced street section, may be
modified to allow parking on both sides with Fire District approval; and
            (5)   One side-only parking areas will be denoted by "chokers" and
pavement striping, not signage, except for one "No Parking" Sign located at the
beginning of the restricted block.
      2.   Phase 1 Mixed Use Streets: These standards are appropriate in the
P1MU Sub-Use District:
         a.   ACHD sections for:
            (1)   Three-lane collector;
            (2)   Two-lane, standard local;
            (3)   Two-lane, minor local; and
            (4)   Two- Lane, local minor.
         b.   Modifications and Exceptions:
            (1)   Addition of planted median, where appropriate, instead of
turn lane;
            (2)   One-way sections around greens and parks designed to meet
Emergency standards with On Street Parking on at least one side (see Village
One-Way Option graphic, following page);
            (3)   The twenty-nine foot (29') reduced street section, may be
modified to allow parking on both sides with Fire District approval; and
            (4)   One side-only parking areas will be denoted by "chokers" and
pavement striping, not signage, except for one "No Parking" Sign located at the
beginning of the restricted block.
      3.   Special Street Sections:
         a.   Within the Village One District, specialized facilities-roadways,
lanes, alleys, and Emergency or maintenance accesses, are allowed to address
site specific conditions or community design. Allowed special street sections
include the following:
            (1)   Constrained: An optional roadway section is available for
Village One District streets in steeply sloped areas that cannot reasonably
accommodate the standard width required for the typical section. This section
includes a forty (40) foot right-of-way with two (2), ten (10) foot travel
lanes and two (2) foot ribbons (or vertical) curbs on each side.
Drainage is accommodated by a grass swale on the uphill side of the street.
Protection for pedestrians is by a standard raised curb or a special wood
guardrail depending on the separation between the vehicle travel-way and the
single pedestrian path located within the right-of-way, on the downhill side of
the street.

IMAGES/0-0-0-811.png]
 
            (2)    Village One Lane: Village One lanes are for limited use to
provide access to individual residential driveways or connections for alleys in
areas that do not require On Street Parking or pedestrian facilities. The
typical section is a twenty-two (22) foot paved travel way and no sidewalks.
The minimum right-of-way will be thirty (30') feet.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/5f033b8735d159d9f2eafbcbbe63f6f3c126fac9/
IMAGES/0-0-0-809.png]
 
            (3)    Mixed Use Alley: Mixed Use Alley will eliminate driveways
and conflicts on some streets. Fewer driveways on streets will result in more
On Street Parking, fewer conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, and
eliminate the need to have garages lining residential streets. Alleys will be
used for utilities and trash collection. The typical Alley section includes a
twelve (12) foot paved lane with eight (8) inch concrete ribbon curbs plus a
three to four (3-4) foot landscaped buffer on each side. In locations where
alleys intersect, flatter curves or widening may be required to accommodate
turning vehicles.

IMAGES/0-0-0-807.png]
 
            (4)   One-Way Option: One-way streets will provide vehicular
circulation around greens or park areas. The street section within a forty (40)
foot right-of-way consists of a twenty to twenty-seven (20-27) foot travel way,
an optional bike lane (where applicable) On Street Parking on one side (to the
right of traffic flow), a five (5) foot planter strip, and detached sidewalk.
The planter strip is optional and the sidewalk may meander or be adjacent to
the curb. On Street Parking may be provided along the interior park area (to
the left of traffic flow) if located in pods of two (2) or four (4) parallel
Parking Spaces and the twenty (20) foot travel way is maintained.

            (5)   Restricted Emergency/Maintenance Access (Private): Where
fully-improved roadway connections between residential clusters are impra ctic
al or wh ere ma intena nce access to a community facility is required, a twenty
(20) foot-wide paved access will be constructed to provide maintenance or
secondary Emergency connections. Vehicular use will be restricted to
maintenance or emergency vehicles by Fire District-approved bollards or gates,
but the access will be open for use by pedestrians and bicyclists. The twenty
(20) foot paved travel way will be located within a twenty-four (24) foot
easement.

11B-5-1: PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   This Chapter provides standards for parking and loading facilities to
ensure adequate parking areas for various uses, minimize traffic hazards and
congestion, promote vehicular and pedestrian safety and efficient land use, and
mitigate impacts on surrounding properties.
Parking is a key element of any development. An oversupply can result in excess
environmental and physical impacts while an undersupply can result in vehicles
intruding onto adjoining properties and neighborhoods. The goal is to find the
balance between providing adequate parking to support approved uses while
minimizing the negative effects of excessive land area or resources devoted to
parking. A well-planned and executed parking program is essential to
establishing and maintaining a human scale environment that emphasizes parking
efficiency over parking supply.
Shared parking is encouraged and is a critical factor in the design and success
of a mixed-use project such as Avimor. A shared parking program versus
traditional parking standards reduces parking requirements, enhances community
character and vitality, increases Streetscape appeal, reduces impervious
surface area and decreases storm water and pollution runoff, reduces the "urban
heat island effect," reduces conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, and
provides better pedestrian flow and connectivity.
   B.   In the interpretation of this Chapter, the following shall govern:
      1.   Parking Spaces for other permitted or conditional uses not listed
herein shall be determined by the Administrator. Among the factors for
determining the number of spaces to be required for a use not listed herein,
the Administrator shall compare the proposed use with a use which has similar
traffic generating characteristics as outlined in the most recent version of
the institute of transportation engineers trip generation manual;
      2.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number;
      3.   When more than one use is conducted on a site, the total number of
Parking Spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for each use unless shared
parking is approved;
      4.   When computing parking requirements based on the amount of square
footage in Buildings, all calculations shall be on a Gross Floor Area basis,
unless specifically stated otherwise;
      5.   Parking Based on Seating: When the parking requirements are based on
seating and the seating consists of benches or pews, each twenty-four (24)
linear inches of bench or pew shall be considered one seat;
      6.   Parking Based on Employees: For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on the number of employees, calculations shall be for the
largest number of persons working on any single shift; and
      7.   Residential Parking: Driveways may be used to satisfy minimum on-
site parking requirements, beyond the covered parking requirements, for
residential dwellings, provided that sufficient length is available to satisfy
the minimum design standards with no obstructions to the adjoining sidewalk.
   C.   Waivers:
      1.   Request: Any person may request a waiver of any provision of this
Chapter.
      2.   Submittal: A request for waiver must be submitted to the
Administrator in writing and must provide specific reasons for which the waiver
is sought. Additionally, it must include an approval letter of waiver request
by the Avimor Design Review Committee.
      3.   Response: The City shall provide a written response within thirty
(30) business days of receipt of a request for waiver.
      4.   Appeal Of Decision: Within ten (10) days of the decision of the
Administrator an appeal may be filed to Council. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-5-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   No Building or structure shall be erected, substantially altered, or
its use changed unless permanently maintained Off Street Parking and Loading
Spaces have been provided in accordance with the provisions of this Title.
   B.   The provisions of this Chapter, except where there is a change of use,
shall not apply to any existing Building or structure. Where a new use involves
no additions or enlargements, there shall be provided as many such spaces as
may be required by this Title.
   C.   Whenever a Building, structure, or use, constructed or changed in use
after the effective date hereof, is changed or enlarged in Floor Area, number
of employees, number of Dwelling Units, seating capacity, or otherwise to
create a need for an increase in the number of existing Parking Spaces per this
Title, additional Parking Spaces shall be provided so that the existing
Building, structure, or use, and proposed enlargement or change in use, shall
then and thereafter comply with the full parking requirements set forth herein.
   D.   The parking requirements in Section 5-4-6 of this Chapter represent
general parking standards for individual uses under which all proposed
development will be evaluated. Requirements for uses not specifically listed
shall be determined by the Administrator based on uses with similar traffic
generation characteristics as outlined in the most recent Institute of Traffic
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. Parking includes garage and carport
spaces.
   E.   Parking Lots shall be screened from adjacent uses, streets and Pathways
by walls, plantings, earth berms or a combination thereof pursuant to the
screening requirements of this Title. Where On Street Parking is provided
adjacent to the use it serves, it shall count towards the parking requirement
for the use.
   F.   Consideration should be given to providing spaces to accommodate
alternative forms of transportation such as, for example, motorcycles, motor
scooters and golf carts. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-5-3: DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Surfacing and Striping, except as approved by the Administrator, or as
allowed below, all parking and loading facilities shall be surfaced, striped
and marked to clearly define access lanes, standard, compact and handicapped
Parking Spaces, and internal circulation movements. The following uses may
require a conditional use permit or Zoning Permit but shall not be required to
have paved parking areas:

agrarian character of the site);
      11.   Temporary Construction Office / Yard;
      12.   Temporary Sales Office/Trailer (if it will not be in use for more
than 12 months);
      13.   Model Homes; and
      14.   Special Events.
   B.   Drainage: All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper
drainage of surface water to prevent the drainage of such water onto adjacent
properties or walkways. Drainage plans shall be reviewed and approved by the
City engineer and, for any site abutting a public street, such plans shall be
reviewed and approved by the Local Highway Department having jurisdiction.
   C.   Access: Off-street parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering
room so that all vehicles may enter an abutting street in a forward direction.
Access driveways for parking areas or Loading Spaces shall be located in such a
way that any vehicle entering or leaving such area shall be clearly visible by
a pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or driveway from a public or
private street.
   D.   Maintenance: The Owner of parking facilities shall be responsible to
continually maintain the parking facilities in compliance with approved site
plans and shall be free of litter and debris.
   E.   Compact Spaces: Shall be designed consistent with Table 5.2 of this
Chapter.
   F.   Location: Off-street parking areas should be located on the sides or
rear of Buildings instead of the front. When parking areas are located in the
front of Buildings, they should be adequately screened pursuant to with Chapter
3 of this Title. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)

   B.   The Administrator may authorize the use of joint parking, offsite
parking or a combination of the methods as described below:
      1.   Joint Parking:
         a.   The uses separately generate parking demands primarily during
hours when the other uses are not in operation and the Parking Spaces serve the
uses without conflict;
         b.   The peak hours of parking demand from the uses shall generally
not coincide so that the peak demand will be less than the parking required;
         c.   The applicant provides documentation showing the parking demand
will be reduced if a public or private transit system serves the use;
         d.   A shared parking analysis has been submitted describing the
nature of the uses and the times when the uses operate so as to demonstrate the
lack of potential conflict;
         e.   A shared parking facility, if located on a site other than the
site where the uses are located, shall be located no further than that
permitted this Chapter;
         f.   The owners of the Parcels or uses cooperatively establish and
operate the facilities;
         g.   The owners of the Parcels execute a cross access agreement for
parking, which outlines the terms and conditions of the shared parking
arrangement. The agreement shall include the following as approved by the City
of Eagle:
            (1)   A guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration in
the uses that will create a greater demand for parking; and
            (2)   A guarantee among the landowners for access to a use of the
shared parking facility.
         h.   Any other information required to be documented on such agreement
by the City in an effort to assure compliance with this Chapter. The agreement
must contain the legal description of both Parcels and must be of sufficient
duration to ensure the continued use of the shared parking facilities. The
agreement shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, and run with
the land.
   C.   Off-Site Parking. The parking requirements may be met by locating the
required Parking Spaces on a separate Parcel from the Lot on which the
Principal Use is located. Off-site parking shall be approved if:
      1.   The Parcels containing the use and the off-site parking are under
common ownership, or a cross-parking easement agreement is provided.
      2.   The Parcel to be used for parking is located as follows from the
Building or use it is intended to serve (as measured along the sidewalk or
walkway available for public use from the primary entrance of the Principal Use
to the furthest Parking Space within the Parcel:
         a.   Not more than five hundred (500') feet for residential uses;
         b.   Not more than one thousand five hundred (1,500') feet in the
Community Commercial (CC), Highway Mixed Use (HMU), and Mixed Use (MU), Village
Commercial (VCOM) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) sub districts and for all
public/quasi-public uses; and
         c.   Not more than one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet for employee
parking on a daily basis where the vehicle is used occasionally, regardless of
the nature of employment.

the Building or use it is intended to serve by an expressway, highway, or
primary arterial.
      4.   The applicant satisfies the Administrator that the use of the off-
site Parcel for parking will not be detrimental to public safety.
      5.   The owner of the Parcels executes an agreement or similar document,
satisfactory to the City attorney, which outlines the terms and conditions of
the off-site parking use. The document must contain the legal description of
both the off-site Parcel and the Parcel where the Principal Use is located and
must be of sufficient duration to ensure the continued use of the off-site
Parcel for parking. In order to provide record notice of the existence of the
off-site parking arrangement, the applicant shall record the document in the
office of the County Recorder and provide a copy of the document to the City.
   D.   Hotel and Motel, Resort Parking: The Administrator may authorize a
reduction in the total number of required Parking Spaces for Hotel, Motel and
Resort developments pursuant to the Joint and Off-Street Parking standards of
this Chapter. Such reduction shall apply only to such uses as Restaurants,
retail stores, amusements/recreational facilities and similar uses which are
clearly ancillary to the Hotel, Motel or Resort. In determining the parking
requirement, the Administrator shall consider the following:
      1.   The characteristic of each use and the projected peak parking
demand, including hours of operation;
      2.   The potential reduction in vehicle movements afforded by multi-
purpose use of spaces by employees or customers;
      3.   The potential reduction in vehicle trips afforded by multiple use of
the facilities by guests and customers; and

      2.   To aid applicants in the preparation and expedition of required
applications;
      3.   To issue zoning permits, certificate of occupancy permits,
notifications and such similar administrative duties;
      4.   To investigate all violations of this Title and notify in writing
the person responsible for such violation(s), ordering the action necessary to
correct such violation;

all conditional provisions that may have been imposed.
      2.   Temporary Certificate Of Occupancy: A temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued by the Administrator for a period not exceeding six (6)
months during alterations or partial occupancy of a Building pending its
completion.

to obtain a zoning permit or certificate of occupancy shall be a violation of
this Title.
      2.   Use And Construction Contrary To Plans: Zoning permits or
certificates of occupancy issued on the basis of plans and applications
approved by the Administrator authorize only the use and arrangement set forth
in such approved plans and applications or amendments thereto, and no other
use, arrangement or construction. Use, arrangement or construction contrary to

11B-7-3: CONDITIONAL USES:
11B-7-3-1: PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION OF CONDITIONAL USE:
   A.   Purpose: It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of
uses are appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more
conventional uses possess characteristics of such unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, method of operation, circulation and public
facilities that each specific use must be considered individually.
   B.   Interpretation Of Conditional Use: Any use which is permitted as a
conditional use in a district under the terms of this Title shall not be deemed
a nonconforming use in such district, but shall, without further action, be
considered a conforming one.
   C.   Exceptions or waivers of standards within this Title, other than use,
inclusive of "Variances" may be permitted through issuance of a conditional use
permit. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-3-2: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   The Commission/Council shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed conditional use in terms of the following
standards and shall find adequate evidence showing such use at the proposed
location:
      1.   Will, in fact, constitute a conditional use as established in
Chapter 2 of this Title for the Land Use District involved;
      2.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives or with any specific objective of this Title;
      3.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      4.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      5.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer and Schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services;
      6.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      7.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
      8.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
      9.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-3-3: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
   A.   In granting any conditional use, the Council may prescribe appropriate
conditions, bonds and safeguards in conformity with this Title. Violations of
such conditions, bonds or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Title.
(Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-3-4: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Application For Conditional Use Permit: An application for conditional
use permit shall be filed with the Administrator by at least one (1) owner or
lessee of property for which such conditional use is proposed. At a minimum,
the application shall contain the following information:
      1.   Name, address, phone number and email address of the applicant;
      2.   Legal description of property;
      3.   Description of existing use;
      4.   Zoning district and Land Use District;
      5.   Description of proposed conditional use;
      6.   A plan for the proposed site for the conditional use showing, as
applicable, the location of all Buildings, parking and loading area, traffic
access and traffic circulation, Open Spaces, landscaping, refuse and service
areas, utilities, Signs, yards and such other information as the Commission may
require to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and
requirements of this Title; and
      7.   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property;
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and
other properties in the vicinity; and the relationship of the proposed use to
the Master Land Use Map.
   B.   Supplemental Information: Prior to granting a conditional use permit,
the Council may request studies from the planning staff or public agencies
concerning social, economic, fiscal and/or environmental effects on the
proposed conditional use.
   C.   Procedure For Approval Of Conditional Use Permit:
      1.   Public Hearing, Notice: The Commission shall hold a public hearing
in which interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. The public
hearing before the Commission shall be scheduled to a date within sixty (60)
days of receipt of an application. Within seventy-five (75) days after receipt
of the application, the Commission shall make its recommendation to approve,
conditionally approve or deny the application. Notice shall be provided as
required by Section
11B-7-11 of this Title.
      2.   Action By The Commission and Council: The Commission shall transmit
its recommendation of approval or denial to the Council. Within sixty (60) days
after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, the Council shall approve or
deny the application. The Council shall follow notice and hearing requirements
set forth in Section
11B-7-11 of this Title. If the application is approved or approved with
modifications, the Council shall direct the Administrator to issue a
conditional use permit listing the specific conditions specified by the Council
for approval.
   Upon granting or denying an application, the Council shall specify:
         a.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         c.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
conditional use permit.
      3.   Notice To Applicant: Within ten (10) days after a written decision
has been rendered, the Administrator shall provide the applicant with written
notice of the action on the request.
   D.   Conditions Of Permit: Upon the granting of a conditional use permit,
conditions shall be attached to said permit including, but not limited to,
those:
      1.   Minimizing adverse impact on other development;
      2.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development;
      3.   Controlling the duration of development;
      4.   Assuring that development is maintained properly;
      5.   Designating the exact location and nature of development;
      6.   Requiring the provision for on site or off-site public facilities or
services; and
      7.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required
in this Title.
   E.   Transfer Of Permit: A conditional use permit is not transferable from
one Parcel of land to another. Conditional use permits are an entitlement to
the specific property on which the approval was granted and upon any transfer
of title for the property the conditional use permit transfers to the new owner
(s) without further application or approval, provided, however, the new owner
(s) shall be bound by the same conditions of approval applicable to the
conditional use permit that was transferred.
   F.   Effect Of Issuance On Other Conditional Uses: A conditional use permit
shall not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other
conditional use permits.
   G.   Time Limitations, Extensions:
      1.   Once a conditional use is approved and exercised, said use may
continue without further temporal constraints, provided that the use complies
with its intended purpose, or City approved modifications thereafter, and does
not violate any codes, subject to the following:
         a.   An approved Conditional Use Permit shall be valid for a term
approved and conditioned by the Council, which term may be perpetual;
         b.   An extension of the time limit for an approved conditional use
may be granted by the Council, at its sole discretion, without further notice
and hearing, if the following findings are made:
            (1)   There are no outstanding applicable conditional use permit
violations on the subject property. If such violations exist, they may be
conditioned by the Council to be cured as a condition of the extension of time;
            (2)   The conditional use, as previously approved, remains in the
best interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the City;
            (3)   There have been no significant changes to this Title between
the date of conditional use approval and the date of the time extension request
that would require substantial modifications to the project;
            (4)   There are no hazardous conditions which have developed or
have been discovered on the project site; and
            (5)   The public facilities and services required for the project
remain adequate. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-4: VARIANCES:
11B-7-4-1: AUTHORITY TO GRANT VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority To Grant Variances: The Council may authorize, in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of this Title as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this Title would result in unnecessary hardship. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or Buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
Buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this Title would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   B.   Application And Standards For Variance: A variance from the terms of
this Title shall not be granted by the Council unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the Administrator and the Council
containing:
      1.   Name, address, phone number and email address of the applicant;
      2.   Legal description of property;
      3.   Description of nature of variance requested; and
      4.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         a.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or Building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or Buildings in the same Land Use
District;
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same Land Use District under the terms of this Title;
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Title to other lands,
structures or Buildings in the same Land Use District; and
         e.   A variance shall not be granted unless the Council makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to the
Council which support conclusions that the above-mentioned standards and
conditions have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-4-2: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
   A.   Under no circumstances shall the Council grant a variance to allow a
use not permissible under the terms of this Title in the Land Use District
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this Title in said Land Use District. In granting any variance, the Council may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Title.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Title.
(Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-7-4-3: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A VARIANCE:
   A.   Public Hearing, Notice: Prior to granting a variance, the Commission
shall hold a public hearing in which interested persons shall have an
opportunity to be heard. The public hearing before the Commission shall be
scheduled to a date within sixty (60) days of receipt of an application. Within
seventy-five (75) days after receipt of the application the Commission shall
make its recommendation to approve, conditionally approve or deny the
application. Notice shall be provided as required by Section
11B-7-11 of this Title.
   B.   Action By the Commission and Council: The Commission shall transmit its
recommendation of approval, conditional approval or denial to the Council.
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, the
Council shall approve or deny the application. The Council shall follow the
notice requirements provided by Section
11B-7-11 of this Title. The Council may approve, conditionally approve or deny
a variance request under the conditions as herein specified and considering

11B-11F-3: VARIANCES:
   A.   Purpose: The Commission may recommend to the Council a Variance from
the provisions of Chapter 11 of this Title on a finding that undue hardship
results from the strict compliance with specific provisions or requirements
hereof or that application of such provisions or requirements is impracticable.
   B.   Standards For Variances: No Variance shall be favorably acted upon by
the Council unless there is a finding, upon recommendation by the Commission,
as a result of a public hearing, that all of the following exist:
      1.   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of Chapter 11 of this
Title would clearly be impracticable or unreasonable. In such cases, the
Subdivider shall first State his reasons in writing as to the specific
provision or requirement involved.
      2.   Strict compliance with the requirements of Chapter 11 of this Title
would result in extraordinary hardship to the Subdivider because of unusual
topography, other physical conditions or other such conditions which are not
self-inflicted, or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the
achievement of the objectives of Chapter 11 of this Title.
      3.   The granting of the specified Variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the
property is situated.
      4.   Such Variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code.
      5.   Such Variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of Chapter 11 of this Title.
   C.   Variances For Signs:
      1.   Applicability: Sign Variances may be granted to the height and
display surface standards, to increase the number of allowed Signs, to allow
relocation of a Sign, and to allow structural alterations, or other design
items.
   D.   The Council may authorize, in specific cases, such Variance from the
terms of this Title as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing
to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Title
would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring
lands, structures or Buildings in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use of lands, structures or Buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for issuance of a Variance. Variances shall not be granted
on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict application of
the provisions of this Title would result in unnecessary hardship.
   E.   Application And Standards For Variance: A Variance from the terms of
this Chapter shall not be granted by the Council unless and until a written
application for a Variance is submitted to the Administrator and the Council
containing:
      1.   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);
      2.   Legal description of property;
      3.   Description of nature of Variance requested; and
      4.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested Variance
conforms to the following standards:
         a.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or Building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or Buildings in the same district;
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Title;
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant or a previous Owner; and
         d.   That granting the Variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Title to other lands,
structures or Buildings. (Ord. 895, 4-25-2023)
11B-11F-4: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Enforcement:
      1.   No Subdivision Plat required by Chapter 11 of this Title or the
Idaho Code shall be admitted to the public land records of the County or
recorded by the County Recorder until such Subdivision Plat has received final
approval of the Council.
      2.   No public board, agency, Commission, official or other authority
shall proceed with the construction of or authorize the construction of any of
the public Improvements required by Chapter 11 of this Title until the Final
Plat has received the approval by the Council.
      3.   No permits for construction of any structure shall be issued on any
Parcel or Lot until it has been determined such Parcel or Lot meets the
requirements of Chapter 11 of this Title. Except for Community Centers, Common
Lots, Pools, or any other construction having to do with Non-Dwelling Units, as
defined in Chapter 1 of this Title.
      4.   The City attorney shall, in addition to taking whatever criminal
action deemed necessary, take steps to civilly enjoin any violation of Chapter
11 of this Title.

Title or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. The landowner, tenant, Subdivider, builder, public official or any
other person who commits, participates in, assists in or maintains such
violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Council or any other public official or private
citizen from taking such lawful action as is necessary to restrain or prevent
any violation of Chapter 11 of this Title or of the Idaho Code. (Ord. 895, 4-
25-2023)
11B-11F-5: APPEALS:
   A.   Final Decision Appeal: Any final decision by the Administrator may be
appealed to the Council. Within fourteen (14) days following the
Administrator's written decision the appealing party shall file a written
notice of appeal with the City clerk before five o'clock (5:00) P.M. or close
of business, whichever occurs later, specifically identifying which
requirements are appealed to the Council including all reasons, factual and
legal, why the decision of the Administrator should be overturned or modified.

This section seeks to promote mutual respect, civility and orderly conduct
among City of Eagle elected officials, employees, and members of the public. It
is not intended to deprive any person of his or her right to freedom of
expression or free speech, but only to maintain, to the extent possible and
reasonable, a safe, productive, and harassment-free workplace for City staff
and a safe and non-threatening environment for visitors, customers and other
members of the public.
The City discourages hostile, intimidating, or otherwise disruptive actions and
encourages professional, respectful, and courteous communication, seeking to

inherent components of an inclusive public process and tools for forging sound
decisions. (Ord. 932, 7-9-2024)
1-12-2: ETHICS:
All City of Eagle elected officials and employees are subject to the

         f.   Repetitive calls, visits or correspondence to City offices or
staff with an associated pattern of disruptive behavior, including verbal or
physical aggression and/or threats, regarding an issue for which City officials
or staff have already provided pertinent information or instructions.
      4.   Enforcement. The rules of civility set forth above shall be enforced
in the following manner:
         a.   Warning: Any City of Eagle official or employee who is directly
affected by or witnesses behavior that disrupts or threatens to disrupt City of
Eagle government operations may direct the person engaging in such behavior to
immediately remove themselves from the premises or otherwise cease such
behavior.
         b.   Resisting Removal or Failing to Cease Behavior: Any person who
resists removal or an order to leave the premises or to cease such behavior
shall be charged with a violation of Idaho Code § 18-7008(8).
   B.   Rules of decorum at public meetings.
      1.   Decorum.
         a.   City of Eagle public meetings, including meetings of the City
Council, Planning and Zoning Commission, and any other City commission,
committee or board (hereinafter "Board" to describe any of the preceding or
like bodies), shall be conducted in an orderly manner to ensure that the public
has an opportunity to be heard and that the deliberative process of the Board
is retained at all times. A City Council meeting or other like Board meeting is
a governmental process with a governmental purpose. The Council/Board has an
agenda to be addressed and dealt with and is not to be prevented from
accomplishing its business in a reasonably efficient manner; order will be
maintained, and the rules of decorum will be enforced.
         b.   General public oral communications, such as a public forum (Town
Hall, Workshops, et al.) or other general public comment periods, may be
offered to the public at City Council and other Board meetings. Aside from
official public hearings, these public comment opportunities during the Board's
business meeting are not required by law or regulation and are at the
discretion of the presiding officer.
         c.   The presiding officer of the Board shall be responsible for
maintaining the order and decorum of meetings and shall, at the commencement of
the meeting, recite aloud the rules and procedure for public participation
during the meeting, or a summary thereof. The presiding officer of the meeting
shall be responsible for enforcing the rules of decorum during the meeting.
      2.   Rules of Decorum. During a public meeting, the following rules of
decorum shall be observed:
         a.   Board Members. The members of the Board shall preserve order and
decorum, and a member shall not by conversation or other means delay or
interrupt the Board's proceedings or disturb any other member while speaking.
Board members shall not communicate electronically with one another or any
member of the public using a mobile phone, computer or other such device about
any City business during the meeting.
         b.   City Staff Members. Employees of the City shall observe the same
rules of order and decorum as those which apply to the members of the Board.
         c.   Persons Addressing the Board. General public oral communications
are not a substitute for any item that can be handled during the normal
business hours of the municipal government. The primary purpose of such oral
communication during a meeting is to allow citizens the opportunity to address
the Board as a whole regarding matters that cannot be handled during the
regular business hours of the City government. Each person who addresses the
Board shall exercise self-control, shall do so in an orderly manner, shall
focus on the issues and avoid personalizing debate, and shall not make
personal, impertinent, slanderous or profane remarks to any member of the
Board, staff or general public. General public oral communication opportunities
are not to be used for the purpose of conveying political rhetoric, i.e. for
political campaigning or the venue to convey support or opposition of a
political candidate or another. Any person who conducts themselves in such a
manner or otherwise impedes the orderly conduct of any meeting shall, at the
discretion of the presiding officer or a majority of the Board, be barred from
further audience before the Board during that meeting.
         d.   Members of the Public. No member of the public shall engage in
disorderly or boisterous conduct, including the utterance of loud, threatening
or abusive language, whistling, speaking out of turn, applause or clapping
(when not led by the presiding officer), the display of signs (cardboard, paper
or otherwise), stamping of feet or other similar acts which disturb, disrupt or
otherwise impede the orderly conduct of any meeting. Any person who conducts
themselves in such a manner or otherwise impedes the orderly conduct of any
meeting shall, at the discretion of the presiding officer or a majority of the
Board, be barred from further audience before the Board during that meeting.
         e.   Addressing the Board. A person wishing to address the Board
during the meeting shall submit a request on a public comment form or otherwise
follow the process provided. No person shall address the Board without first
being recognized by the presiding officer . The following procedures shall be
observed by persons addressing the Board:
            (1)   Each person speaking shall have up to three (3) minutes to
address the Board, which time shall be kept and noted by the presiding officer
and/or clerk. The presiding officer may, at his or her discretion, limit or
extend the time for public comment at the meeting, as time permits. Any
extension or limit shall be applied equally and fairly to all members of the
public. During official public hearings only, and only upon prior approval of
the presiding officer, a member of the public in attendance may gift their time
to another member of the public in attendance. This may be allowed one time
only for both the person gifting their time and for the person who receives it.
This procedure is applicable only during official public hearings and shall not
be utilized for any other public comment period.
            (2)   When called by the presiding officer the individual who
wishes to speak shall introduce themselves, stating their name and address. If
speaking during the general oral communications or public forum portion of the
meeting, the person speaking shall also state the subject on which they wish to
comment.
            (3)   During general public comment portions of the meeting, any
subject which is deemed irrelevant or repetitious by the presiding officer, or
majority of the Board shall be immediately concluded.
            (4)   All remarks shall be addressed to the Board as a whole and
not to any single member thereof, unless in response to a question from such
member. The person speaking shall address only the Board and shall not address
members of City staff or other members of the audience.
            (5)   No question may be asked of a member of the City Council or
of City staff. Public hearings and other opportunities afforded for public
comment are for comments only.
            (6)   Once the meeting is underway, members of the public are not
to approach the dais, the clerk or any other staff member situated at the front
of the room near the dais, as this disrupts the meeting and the work that is
being undertaken by these staff members.
      3.   Enforcement. The rules of decorum set forth above shall be enforced
in the following manner:
         a.   Warning. The presiding officer shall request that a person who is
breaching the rules of decorum cease such conduct. If, after receiving a
warning from the presiding officer, a person persists in such conduct, the
presiding officer shall order that person to leave the meeting.
         b.   Removal. The presiding officer may request law enforcement who
are in attendance, or direct City Staff to initiate contact with law
enforcement to carry out all orders and instructions of the presiding officer
for the purpose of maintaining order and decorum during the meeting, including
removal of any such person from the proceedings.
         c.   Resisting Removal. Any person who resists removal by the
presiding officer shall be charged with a violation of Idaho Code § 18-7008(8).
      4.   Adjournment. If a meeting is disturbed or disrupted in such a manner
as to make it infeasible or improbable to restore order, the meeting may be
adjourned or continued by the presiding officer or a majority of the Board, and
any remaining business may be considered at the next meeting.
   C.   Trespass and Penalty.
      1.   Notice of Trespass. Any person who violates the provisions of the
Rules of Civility in the lobbies, offices or meeting rooms of Eagle City Hall
or other City owned or operated facilities or property where official City
business is being conducted by City officials, or violates the Rules of Decorum

right to appeal said trespass order by submitting a statement to the City
Clerk's office by email, U.S. Mail or other means acceptable to the City within
ten (10) calendar days of the date of the trespass order, which statement shall

City Council will consider and make a decision based on information presented
by City staff and the statement submitted by the appellant. If no statement is
received by the City Clerk's office within 10 calendar days of the date of the
trespass order, no appeal will be considered.
         b.   Any person trespassed from a City public meeting has the right to
appeal said trespass order by submitting a statement to the City Clerk's office
by email, U.S. Mail or other means acceptable to the City within ten (10)
calendar days of the date of the trespass order, which statement shall be

presented by City staff and/or members of the applicable City commission,
committee or board and the statement submitted by the appellant. If no
statement is received by the City Clerk's office within 10 calendar days of the
date of the trespass order, no appeal will be considered.
         c.   The right to appeal under subsections a and b, above, is not

order to leave the premises or to cease disruptive behavior may be guilty of a
misdemeanor under Idaho Code § 18-7008(8), punishable as provided by Idaho law.
This penalty provision is not intended to supplant any provision of Idaho law
which may render additional or more serious punishment for threats against
public officials or public servants as proscribed by Title 18, Idaho Code.

4-5-17: DESIGNATION AND MANAGEMENT OF DANGEROUS OR AT-RISK DOGS:
   A.   Purpose.
      1.   Dangerous and At-Risk dogs found within the boundaries of the City
of Eagle present a risk to the health, safety, and welfare of persons and other
animals. The purpose of this Section is to provide policies and procedures for
the safe management of Dangerous and At-Risk dogs to promote the public health,
safety, and welfare, while also promoting the humane and ethical treatment of
animals.
   B.   Procedure for Designating a Dog as Dangerous or At-Risk.
      1.   If an Animal Control Officer has probable cause to believe a dog is
Dangerous or At-Risk, as those terms are defined in this Chapter, the Officer
shall have authority to designate the dog as Dangerous or At-Risk and shall
serve a written Notice of Designation on the owner of the dog. An Animal
Control Officer shall have authority to designate an animal regardless of
whether or not an owner has been charged with a crime related to an unprovoked
animal attack. The Notice of Designation shall:
         a.   Be personally served on the owner by an Animal Control Officer or
other authorized person.
         b.   Identify whether the dog is being designated as Dangerous or At-
Risk;
         c.   Identify the date on which the officer determined the dog to be
Dangerous or At-Risk;
         d.   Provide a description of the factual circumstances and events
that support the officer's decision to designate the dog as Dangerous or At-
Risk;
         e.   Provide a clear description of the dog such that it can be
identified, a photograph of the dog is encouraged;
         f.   Provide notice that the owner may petition the Animal Control
Agency to review the Officer's decision to designate the animal as Dangerous or
At-Risk;
         g.   Provide notice that the Officer's designation decision shall
become final after ten (10) business days if the owner fails to petition the
Animal Control Agency to review the Notice of Designation;
         h.   Provide notice that owners of a dog designated as At-Risk or
Dangerous may either keep the dog in their possession and be subject to the
restrictions the Animal Control Agency puts in place for the keeping of such
dogs, or may voluntarily relinquish custody of the dog to the Animal Control
Agency; and
         i.   Provide notice that the final disposition of a dog voluntarily
relinquished to, or seized by, the Animal Control Agency pursuant to this
Section may be adoption or euthanasia, and this decision shall be in the sole
discretion of the Animal Control Agency.
      2.   No dog may be designated as Dangerous or At-Risk when, at the time
an injury or damage was sustained, the precipitating cause constituted
justified provocation.
      3.   An Animal Control Officer has the authority to seize and impound a
dog that has been determined, by an Animal Control Officer, to be:
         a.   Dangerous; or
         b.   Present an ongoing risk.
      4.   When an Animal Control Officer designates a dog as At-Risk the
Animal Control Officer shall have authority, but is not required, to seize and
impound the dog. Where the officer chooses to leave the dog in the owner's
custody and care, based upon the owner's express willingness to comply with
requirements and restrictions for keeping such dogs, the Officer shall provide
notice to the owner of the requirements and restrictions for keeping At-Risk
dogs as provided in this Section.
      5.   If an owner chooses to petition the Animal Control Agency to review
the Officer's designation decision, the owner shall be responsible for any fees
associated with boarding and caring for the animal during the time the petition
and any additional proceedings are pending, as well as any fees associated with
processing and considering the petition.
   C.   Any owner that receives a Notice of Designation shall be permitted to
appeal that designation as an affected person as provided in this Chapter.
   D.   Keeping Dangerous Dogs: The owner of a dog designated as Dangerous, or
a new adoptive owner of a dog designated as Dangerous prior to being adopted,
shall be subject to the following restrictions for the keeping of such dog
within the boundaries of City of Eagle:
      1.   The dog shall be licensed pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter.
      2.   The owner shall be required to have a microchip implanted in the dog
that allows for identification of the animal and the owner shall be required to
report the microchip number to the Animal Control Agency.
      3.   The owner shall be required to procure and maintain liability
insurance of not less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) in the
case of a dog that is designated as Dangerous based on an attack or injury
inflicted on any person, or twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in the case of a
dog that is designated as Dangerous based solely on attacks or injuries
inflicted on animals but not people, that covers any damage or injury that may
be caused by such Dangerous dog; the City shall be named as an additional
insured on this policy for the purpose that the City Clerk, or other licensing
authority, will be notified by the insurance company if the policy is
cancelled, terminated, or otherwise expires.
      4.   The dog shall be contained within an enclosure on the owner's
property; this enclosure may be a fence, kennel, or other adequate means of
containing the animal to the owner's property. The Animal Control Agency shall
be permitted to inspect such enclosure, and if the enclosure is found to be
defective or inadequate by the Agency the owner shall not be permitted to keep
the dog until the enclosure improved as requested by the Animal Control Agency.
Failure to improve the enclosure shall result in the inability of the owner to
keep the Dangerous Dog.
      5.   The owner shall be required to post signs on their property that
announce to other persons that there is a Dangerous Dog on the property. Such
signs must be placed at any potential entrance point to the yard or home (such
as at gates, doors, and on the enclosure where the dog is kept), and must
include words indicating the presence of a "dangerous" dog. A sign merely
stating "Beware of Dog," without also identifying the dog to be "dangerous,"
"vicious" or some substantially similar word indicating the dog's propensity
for aggression shall be insufficient.
      6.   In the event the owner takes the dog off their property, the dog
shall be on a leash no greater than three (3) feet in length, and the dog shall
also be required to wear a muzzle. The leash must be of adequate strength to
restrain the dog, and the person holding the leash must be physically capable
of restraining and controlling the dog; the dog must not be allowed to be off
leash within city limits including any areas designated as off leash areas, the
dog shall not be kept at dog care facilities where dogs are kept in group off
leash housing. The owner or custodian of the dog shall ensure that the dog is
not allowed to have physical contact with any other dog or person other than
the keeper, custodian or immediate family of the owner when off the property of
the owner.
      7.   The owner shall be required to spay or neuter the dog.
      8.   The owner shall be obligated to schedule and obtain annual
inspections of the dog by the Animal Control Agency.
   E.   Keeping At-Risk Dogs: The owner of a dog designated as At-Risk, or a
new adoptive owner of a dog designated as At-Risk prior to being adopted, shall
be subject to the following restrictions for the keeping of such dog within the
boundaries of the City of Eagle:
      1.   The dog shall be licensed pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter;
      2.   The owner shall be required to have a microchip implanted in the dog
that allows for identification of the animal and the owner shall be required to
report the microchip number to the Animal Control Agency;
      3.   The dog shall be contained within an enclosure on the owner's
property; this enclosure may be a fence, kennel, or other adequate means of
containing the animal to the owner's property. The Animal Control Agency shall
be permitted to inspect such enclosure, and if the enclosure is found to be
defective or inadequate by the Agency the owner shall not be permitted to keep
the dog until the enclosure improved as requested by the Animal Control Agency.
Therefore, the dog may be impounded until the enclosure is repaired or
improved. Failure to improve the enclosure shall result in the inability of the
owner to keep the At-Risk dog;
      4.   In the event the owner takes the dog off their property, the dog
shall be on a leash no greater than six (6) feet in length. Further the leash
must be of adequate strength to restrain the dog, and the person holding the
leash must be physically capable of restraining and controlling the dog; the
dog must not be allowed to be off leash within City limits including any areas
designated as off leash areas, the dog shall not be kept at dog care facilities
where dogs are kept in group off leash housing. The owner or custodian of the
dog shall ensure that the dog is not allowed to have physical contact with any
other dog or person other than the keeper, custodian or immediate family of the
owner when off the property of the owner.
   F.   In addition to any criminal penalties, failure to comply with any of
the restrictions in Section (D) or (E) above may result in the dog being
immediately seized and impounded. An owner is permitted to redeem the animal
from impound so long as the owner comes into compliance with the provisions of
Section (D) or (E), whichever is applicable, within ten (10) days of the dog
being seized. If the owner fails to come into compliance with the provisions of
the applicable Section (D) or (E), the Animal Control Agency may place the dog
up for adoption or euthanize the dog, provided the Agency complies with the
adoption or euthanasia guidelines provided for elsewhere in this Chapter.
   G.   Transfer of At-Risk or Dangerous Dogs: If an owner of an At-Risk or
Dangerous dog transfers ownership of the dog to another person, they shall be
obligated to notify the new owner of the designation. Further, they shall be
obligated to notify the Animal Control Agency of the transfer of ownership of
the animal, and provide to the Animal Control Agency the name, physical
address, and telephone number of the new owner of the dog. The new owner shall
be obligated to comply with the requirements set forth in this Section for
keeping At-Risk or Dangerous dogs.
   H.   Disposition of Dogs Designated as Dangerous or At-risk.
      1.   In the event a dog designated as Dangerous again, while unprovoked,
attacks a person, such dog shall be subject to immediate impounding by the
Animal Control Agency and shall be humanely euthanized as expeditiously as
reasonably possible. Such second attack need not cause serious injury for this
provision to apply.
      2.   As proscribed elsewhere in this Chapter, Dangerous or At-Risk dogs
may be impounded under various circumstances. Where such dogs are voluntarily
relinquished by the owner, or where the owner cannot or will not redeem the dog
from impound, the Animal Control Agency shall be permitted to place the dog for
adoption if, in the Agency's judgment, the dog can be safely adopted to a new
home. Where the Agency concludes the dog cannot be safely adopted, the Agency

highway, street, alley or road for twenty four (24) hours or longer.
ABANDONED VEHICLE: Any vehicle observed by a City law enforcement officer or
reported by a member of the public to have been left within the limits of any
highway, street, alley, road or right-of-way thereof, or upon the property of
another without the consent of the property owner for a period of twenty four
(24) hours or longer, except that a vehicle shall not be considered abandoned
if its owner-operator is unable to remove it from the place where it is located

owner(s).
(Comment: This is a distinct and separate classification from abandoned
vehicle. Abandoned vehicles are vehicles belonging to one person and left on
the property of another person or political subdivision. Junk vehicles fail to
conform to vehicle equipment standards and are not in the process of repair and
restoration. One way a violation of section
4-7-5-1 of this chapter occurs is where a junk vehicle is left by its owner on
property of the vehicle owner.)

into custody and is stored pursuant to this chapter, the City shall give
written notice by certified mail to the registered and legal owners of the
vehicle, if known. The notice shall state:
      1.   That the vehicle has been taken into custody and stored; and
      2.   The location of storage of the vehicle.
   C.   The City shall appraise the vehicle and shall include in the notice:
identification of the officer; location of the vehicle; a description of the

located, who has reasonable grounds to believe that the vehicle has been
abandoned, may remove the vehicle from a highway, street, alley, roadway or
right-of-way thereof, or from public or private property to a garage or place
of safety.
   B.   Upon discovery of an abandoned vehicle which is not within the class of
vehicles defined under "emergency circumstances" in section
4-7-6-3 of this chapter, a city law enforcement officer shall attach on the

time and date after the vehicle will be removed; and the telephone number and
address at the city where further information can be obtained. A reasonable
attempt shall be made to notify, by telephone, the owner of any vehicle which
has current license plates and registration as shown on the records of the
Idaho transportation department, prior to the expiration of the forty eight
(48) hours' notice period, of the location of the vehicle and the time and date
of intent to remove the vehicle. The inability of a city law enforcement
officer to notify the owner shall not preclude the removal of the vehicle at
the expiration of the forty eight (48) hour period.
   C.   Any vehicle which does not have current or any license plates attached
may be immediately removed to a safe place of storage. (Ord. 247, 7-19-1994)
4-7-6-5: POSTSTORAGE HEARING:
   A.   Whenever a city law enforcement officer directs the towing or storage
of a vehicle, except vehicles impounded for investigation pursuant to section
4-7-6-3 of this chapter (the emergency removal provision), the city shall
provide the vehicle's registered and legal owner(s) of record, or their agents,
with the opportunity for a poststorage hearing to determine the validity of the
storage.

registered and legal owner(s) within forty eight (48) hours, excluding the
weekends and holidays, and shall include the following information:
      1.   The name, address and telephone number of the city providing the
notice;
      2.   The location of the place of storage and description of the vehicle
which shall include, if available, the name or make, identification number, the
license plate number, and the mileage;
      3.   The authority and purpose for the removal of the vehicle; and
      4.   In order to receive a poststorage hearing, the owner(s), or their
agents, must request the hearing in writing within ten (10) days of the date of
the notice. Any such hearing shall be conducted within forty eight (48) hours
of the request, excluding weekends and holidays. The city may authorize its own

facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons for the sole
purpose of providing cable service or video service, including but not limited
to any public utility or other grantee franchised or permitted to do business
in the city. No privilege, right of eminent domain or exemption shall be
granted or conferred upon a grantee by any franchise, except those specifically
prescribed therein, and any use of any street shall be consistent with any
prior lawful occupancy of the street or any subsequent improvement or
installation therein.
   B.   In accepting a franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights are
subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the city to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the
public, and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the
city pursuant to such power.
   C.   A franchise issued by the city shall be subject to the right of the

franchise area within a reasonable period of time as determined by the city. In
that case, any property owned by the grantee and not removed from the streets
within six (6) months from the date of the city's order shall be considered to
have been abandoned by the grantee and will become the property of the city to
do with as it may choose. If a grantee fails to remove its facilities as
provided in this section, the city may have the removal done at the grantee's
expense, and any cost incurred by the city in removing the grantee's facilities
from the city's streets or property will be a claim against the grantee.

not preclude the city from granting other or further franchises or permits, or
preclude the city from using any streets or other public properties or affect
its jurisdiction over them or any part of them, or limit the full power of the

permits, zoning, fees to be paid, or right-of-way or street management, or to
take the place of any general license or permit required for the privilege of
transacting or carrying on a business within the city as required by the
ordinances and laws of the city, or for attaching devices to poles or other
structures, whether owned by the city or a private entity, or for excavating or
performing other work in or along the streets or rights-of-way.

poles owned and used by the grantee in connection with its fire or police
signal systems or other city use, such attachments to be installed and
maintained in accordance with the requirements of the national electrical
safety code and only after written notice to the grantee; provided however,
that the grantee shall assume no liability or expense in connection therewith,
and provided further, that the city's use thereof shall be in such a manner as
not to interfere with the television operations of the grantee. In case of any
emergency or disaster, the grantee shall, upon request of the city council,
make available it facilities to the city for emergency use.
   I.   A franchise grated under this chapter shall be a privilege to be held
in personal trust by the grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred,
leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or
involuntary sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the city expressed by a resolution.

rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business

6-4-5: CONDITIONS ON STREET OCCUPANCY AND USE:
   A.   Use: All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment
erected by the grantee within the city shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and
places, and not to interfere with existing public utility installations. In all
areas of the city where the cables, wires or other like facilities of public
utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires or
other like facilities underground.
      1.   To the extent the grantee constructs and maintains its cables and
other equipment on or about private property, and an easement for such use has
already been granted to a telephone company or other public utility, said
easement shall, if at all possible, be interpreted so as to grant the grantee
the same rights and privileges as have been granted to telephone companies and
other public utilities. In such easements, the words "telephone company" shall
be interpreted to include the grantee.
      2.   The grantee shall furnish to and file with the city, maps, plats and
permanent records of the location and character of all facilities constructed,
including underground facilities.
   B.   Restoration: In case of any disturbance of rights of way, pavement,
sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall, at its own expense,
and in the manner provided by the city, replace and restore all rights of way,
paving, sidewalk, driveway or other surface of any street or alley disturbed.
The grantee shall, for a period of one year, guarantee such restoration and in
the event there is a problem, shall, upon given notice, repair same within
fifteen (15) days after notice. If the grantee fails to complete such repairs
as requested, then the city may do so at the expense of the grantee.
   C.   Relocations: If at any time during the period of this franchise the
city shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade or location of any
street, alley or other public way, the grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by
the city, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground
conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense, and in each instance
comply with the requirements of the city.
   D.   Placement Of Fixtures: The grantee shall not place poles, conduits, or
other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any
gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrant or other utility, and all such
poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to
comply with the requirements of the city.
   E.   Temporary Removal Of Wires And/Or Fixtures For Building Moving: The
grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the
city, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings,
the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the person requesting the
same, and the grantee shall be given not less than forty eight (48) hours'
advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes.
   F.   Tree Trimming: The grantee shall have authority to trim any trees upon
and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public places of the city
so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the
wires and cable of the grantee, except that at the option of the city, such
trimming may be done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at the
expense and liability of the grantee. (Ord. 676, 9-25-2012)
6-4-6: ERECTION, REMOVAL AND COMMON USE OF POLES:
   A.   No poles or other wire holding structures shall be erected by the
grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height,
type and other pertinent aspects. However, location of any pole or wire holding
structure of the grantee shall not be a vested interest and such poles or
structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense
whenever the city determines that public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
   B.   Where poles or other wire holding structures of any public utility
company are available for use by the grantee, the city may require the grantee
to use such poles and structures if the permission and consent of such public
utility company may be obtained by the grantee and if the terms of the use
available to the grantee are just and reasonable.
   C.   Where a public utility serving the city desires to make use of the
poles or other wire holding structures of the grantee, but agreement therefor
with the grantee cannot be reached, the city may require the grantee to permit
such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the council shall
determine to be just and reasonable, if the use will enhance the public
convenience and if it would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operation.
   D.   Where city owned utility poles are available for use of the grantee,
the grantee shall pay the city the same pole rental per annum as paid by the
grantee for the use of poles owned by public utilities. (Ord. 676, 9-25-2012)
6-4-7: SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND EXTENSION:
   A.   The grantee is hereby authorized to extend the system within the
franchise area to the extent that such extension is or may become technically
and economically feasible.
   B.   Wherever the grantee shall have received written requests for service
from at least ten (10) subscribers within one thousand six hundred twenty five
(1,625) cable meters (5,280 cable feet) of its aerial trunk cable, or from at
least fifteen (15) subscribers within one thousand six hundred twenty five
(1,625) cable meters (5,280 cable feet) of its underground trunk cable, it
shall extend its system to such subscribers solely for the usual connection and
service fees for all subscribers.
The one thousand six hundred twenty five meters (1,625 m) shall be measured in
extension length of grantee's cable required for service located within the
public way or easement and shall not include length of necessary drop to the
subscriber's home or premises.
   C.   No person in the grantee's service area shall be arbitrarily refused
service; but in recognition of the capital costs involved in unusual
circumstances, including, without limitation, instances when the distance from
distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers is more than forty
five meters (45 m) (150 cable feet) or when a subscriber density exists less
than the density specified hereinabove, service may be made available on the
basis of costs of materials, labor and easements, in order to prevent
inequitable burdens on cable subscribers in more densely populated areas.
   D.   For all residential structures hereinafter erected which are to be
served by underground utilities, the developer of the subdivision or
development may acquire CATV service or video service for the development under
the following conditions; but otherwise the grantee shall not be obligated to
construct a CATV system or video service system in such new development:
Developer shall perform all trenching and backfilling necessary for the
provision of cable television service, or video service, including furnishing
of any imported backfill material required, and will furnish and install for
the grantee any necessary distribution conduit and substructures, including
pedestals, required in accordance with the grantee's plans and specifications.
Developer may enter into a written agreement with the grantee whereby such

its books and records, which may include the provider's tax billing records,
that are kept in the regular course of business.
      2.   Revenue of an affiliate shall be included in the calculation of

quarterly basis, forty-five (45) days after the close of each calendar quarter.

this chapter, the city shall give written notice of the particular items
wherein said grantee has failed to perform and said grantee is hereby given a
period of sixty (60) days to correct the defaults of which the notice
complains. If no correction is made during said period, the city may, at its
discretion, assess a penalty of twenty five dollars ($25.00) per day until such
default is corrected. Provided, however, the grantee may petition the city for
an extension of time to comply for good cause shown. The determination of what
constitutes good cause shall be determined by the city and the decision of the
city shall be accepted as final. The following shall be deemed good cause for
an extension: strikes, floods, fire, acts of God, force majeure, labor
disputes, unavailability of building materials beyond the control of the
grantee or any other cause beyond the control of the grantee. (Ord. 676, 9-25-

detector check meters, and any required special water meters installed for the
service to the standby connection.

the size of the service connection and subsequent bills rendered on the basis
of the regular water rates.

may be combined for billing purposes.
   C.   Disputed Bills: When a customer disputes the correctness of a bill, he
shall deposit with the city the amount of the disputed bill at the time the
complaint is lodged, to preclude discontinuance of service pending final
settlement of the bill or bills. Subsequent bills shall be paid or placed on
deposit in a similar manner. Failure of the customer to make such a deposit
may, at the city's option, warrant late charges, discontinuance of service or
legal action, as provided under subsection F of this section.
   D.   Failure To Read Meters: In the event that it shall be impossible or
impractical to read a meter on the regular reading date or that the water
department, for whatever reason, fails to read a meter, the water consumption
shall be prorated on the basis of thirty (30) days per month and the total
water consumption for billing purposes for that period shall be estimated.
   E.   Payment Of Bills: Each bill rendered shall contain the final date on
which payment is due. If the bill is not paid by that date, the account shall
be considered delinquent, unless other arrangements have been made with the
city, in writing, that specify another due date.
   F.   Delinquent Accounts:
      1.   Delinquent Notice: A reminder of account delinquency may be sent, at
the discretion of the city clerk, to each delinquent account on or about
fifteen (15) days after the account becomes delinquent.

established by the council by resolution upon the passage of this chapter and
may be reviewed and updated by resolution of the council as the council so
desires.
      3.   Turn Off Notice: On or about sixty (60) days after an account
becomes delinquent, a turn off notice may be sent to the customer. Said notice

notice"). The water department, no sooner than twenty four (24) hours after
delivery of the final notice, excluding weekends and holidays, between the
hours of eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. and three o'clock (3:00) P.M., shall
discontinue water service to the user. Delivery of notice to the premises
served by the water department shall be considered as delivery of notice to the
customer.

delinquent account upon receipt of a satisfactory installment plan for the
payment of the overdue amount, the installment period not to exceed the period
of time the account was delinquent. (Ord. 202, 5-26-1992)
6-5-12: METER ERROR:
   A.   Meter Accuracy: All meters will be tested prior to installation. No
meter will be placed in service or allowed to remain in service which is known
to have an error in registration in excess of two percent (2%) under conditions
of normal operation.
   B.   Meter Test:
      1.   Standard Test: Meter tests will be conducted in accordance with
standards of practice established by the American water works association or
some other test method recommended by the meter manufacturer.
      2.   On Customer Request: A customer may, by giving not less than seven
(7) days' notice, request the superintendent to test the meter servicing the
customer's premises. The city will require the customer to pay to the city a
testing fee. This fee shall be based upon the cost of testing the meter as
determined by the city council. The fee deposit will be returned to the
customer if the test reveals the meter to over measure the water flow by more
than two percent (2%) under standard test conditions, otherwise, the fee shall
be retained by the city. Customers may, at their option, witness any meter
tests which they request, although the time and date of the test shall be
determined solely by the water department.
      3.   On Water Department Request: If, upon comparison of past water
usage, it appears that a meter is not registering properly, the water
department may, at its option, test and adjust the charges accordingly if the
meter either over measures or under measures the water flow. No charge for
meter testing will be made to the customer for the meter test under these
conditions.
   C.   Adjustments Of Bill For Meter Error:
      1.   Liability: Neither the city nor the customer will be liable to the
other for any over or under payment of water usage due to a meter which shows
readings either above or below the accuracy standard defined in subsection A of
this section. This subsection C1 will not apply as to nonregistering meters.
      2.   Nonregistering Meters: The water department will bill the customer
for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The bill will be
computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer's prior
use during the same season of the year, or upon a reasonable comparison with
the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same
season and under similar circumstances and conditions. (Ord. 202, 5-26-1992)
6-5-13: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
   A.   On Customer Request: Each customer about to vacate any premises
supplied with water service by the water department shall give the water
department written notice of its intentions at least two (2) business days
prior thereto, specifying the date service is to be discontinued; otherwise, he
will be responsible for all water supplied to such premises until the water
department shall receive notice of such removal.
At the time specified by the customer that he expects to vacate the premises
where service is supplied or that he desires to be discontinued, the meter will
be read and a bill rendered which is payable immediately. In no case will the
bill be less than the monthly minimum specified in the schedule applying to the
class or classes of service furnished.

350, 6-22-1999)
   D.   Water Waste: Where water is wastefully or negligently used on a
customer's premises, seriously affecting the general service, the water
department may discontinue service if such conditions are not corrected after
notice by the water department.
   E.   Service Detrimental To Others: The city may refuse to furnish water and
may discontinue service to any premises where excessive demands by one customer
will result in inadequate service to others.
   F.   Fraud Or Abuse: The city and/or the water department will refuse or
discontinue service to any premises where it is deemed necessary to protect the
city from fraud or abuse. Discontinuance of service from one or both of these
causes will be made immediately upon receipt of knowledge by the water
department that the condition or conditions exist.
   G.   Unauthorized Turn On: Where water service has been discontinued for any
reason and the water is turned on by the customer or other unauthorized person,
the water may then be shut off at the main or the meter removed. The charges
for shutting off the water at the main or removing the meter shall be
established by the council by resolution after passage of this chapter and may
be reviewed and updated by resolution of the council as the council so desires.
These charges shall be billed to the offending customer and water shall not be
furnished to the premises or customer until such charges are paid and the city
has reasonable assurance that the violation will not reoccur.
   H.   Noncompliance With Regulations: The city may, upon five (5) days'
notice, discontinue service to a customer's premises for failure to comply with

Restoration of service after discontinuance of service for unsafe facilities,
water waste, fraud, abuse, unauthorized turn on or for noncompliance with this
chapter or any of the policies, rules and regulations of the city will only be
made after the irregularity has been corrected and the city has been assured
that the irregularity will not reoccur. In addition, a rule violation
restoration charge shall be required in addition to any other charges due or
past due that the city may have incurred to correct the irregularity. (Ord.
202, 5-26-1992)

irrigation, aesthetic, amenity, or recreation needs of the proposed development
and/or property proposed to be annexed. Said water rights must be valid,
existing water rights recognized by the Idaho department of water resources
(the "department"). If any transfer, amendment or other proceedings are
required under Idaho Code or department rule or regulation for the city's use
of such water, the owner and/or developer shall be solely responsible for the
city's costs of completing the same and the city's costs of obtaining all
necessary approvals from the department as a condition of annexation and/or
development, including costs associated with mitigation;
      2.   Secure suitable ground water rights adequate to satisfy all ground
water needs of the proposed development and/or property proposed to be annexed
and transfer or assign said water rights to the city for inclusion into the
city's municipal water supply system. Said water rights must be valid, existing
water rights permitted or licensed by the department. If any transfer,
amendment or other proceedings are required under Idaho Code or department rule
or regulation for the city's use of such water, the owner and/or developer
shall be solely responsible for the city's costs of completing the same and the
city's costs of obtaining all necessary permits and approvals from the
department as a condition of annexation and/or development, including costs of
mitigation;
      3.   Pay for the city's costs of construction of municipal supply well(s)
necessary to meet the demands of the proposed annexed property and/or new
development. The city engineer shall determine the necessary location, number,
and capacity of well(s) based upon the proposed development or other
improvements. Said wells shall be constructed to city standards. The owner and/
or developer shall be solely responsible for the city's costs of obtaining all
necessary permits and approvals for such wells as a condition of annexation
and/or development, including the costs of any required mitigation. The design
and construction of municipal supply wells shall be reviewed and inspected by
the city engineer;
         a.   At the option of the city, demands arising from more than one

be prohibited within the city's municipal water service area except as may be
set forth in a development agreement or by a special purpose permit issued by
the building official and approved by the city council.
      5.   The requirements for obtaining surface water rights for irrigation,
aesthetic, amenity, or recreation needs may be waived if the city determines
that the landowner and/or developer is entitled to a waiver under subsection 9-
4-1-9C2 of this code and that the landowner and/or developer cannot secure
surface water rights by appropriation or transfer to the proposed development
and/or property proposed to be annexed.

6-5-24: CONTRIBUTION OF PROPORTIONATE OFF SITE CONSTRUCTION COSTS:
   A.   Water Construction Equivalency Fee: Notwithstanding any of the
provisions of this chapter, any person or property owner who has not otherwise
paid for, or contributed proportionately toward the costs and expenses of
constructing a water line, drilling necessary wells, development of storage
facilities or reservoirs, or construction of distribution lines whether that
construction has been performed by the city, a local improvement district or a
private entity, or combination thereof, and who subsequently desires to connect
to the city water system, shall be required to pay, in addition to the required
service connection charges and the monthly user charges, an additional
connection charge which shall be known and referred to as the "Water
Construction Equivalency Fee".
   B.   Determination Of Payment: In determining who has or has not paid, or
contributed proportionately, toward the costs and expenses of constructing a
water line, the sole factor shall be whether that user, or a predecessor in
title of the user's property, has in fact, paid consideration to the city in
cash, services, or in kind, for the construction of the water main or trunk
line to which the user now desires to connect, which consideration is
commensurate with what the user, or his predecessor in title, would have paid
under this section had the user not paid or contributed previously to the cost
of construction of the water line.
   C.   Water Construction Equivalency Fee Established By Council Resolution:
The water construction equivalency fee for each parcel of ground served by the
new water line shall be established and set by the council by resolution upon
passage of this chapter and shall be reviewed annually and updated by
resolution of the council, which shall consider the use to which the property
will be put, the expected water demand, and the amount of delivery capacity of
the line that will be used by the proposed use.
   D.   Considerations For Determination Of Water Construction Equivalency Fee:
The council shall also take into consideration the amount of land that might be
able to be serviced by the water line whether the land to be benefited is
directly adjacent to the line or not and shall also take into consideration the
cost of the engineering and construction of the line, in current dollars and
shall consider the interest that could have been earned on the money used to
pay for the original water line. The water construction equivalency fee may be
different for residential, commercial, and industrial uses and may be different
for different uses within those classifications depending upon the
considerations referenced above and may also vary as to whether the property to
be served is within or outside the city limits. (Ord. 202, 5-26-1992)
6-5-25: COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Cooperative Agreements: Should a customer or developer, at its own
expense, construct an extension to the water system in a public right of way or
easement according to the city's construction and design standards, with prior
approval of the city, and which water line extension has been determined by the
city to be able to benefit properties other than the customer's or developer's,
the customer or developer constructing the extension may request that the city
enter into an agreement with the customer or developer such that all or a
portion of the costs of extending the water line will be reimbursed to that
water developer from the service connection charges collected from those
property owners who will benefit from the water line extension and who
otherwise have not paid or contributed their proportionate share to the
construction costs of that water line and who are required to pay the water
construction equivalency fee. The city may require the customer or developer to
construct an oversized line, where it is determined that a larger water line is
necessary to serve other areas in the future.
   B.   Discretion Of Council: The city shall not be required to enter into any
such agreement and the decision as whether or not to enter into any such
agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the city council.
      1.   Duration: No reimbursement agreement shall have a duration greater
than ten (10) years unless the city is a beneficiary of the agreement.
      2.   Reimbursement Limitation: No reimbursement agreement shall pay to
the water user, paying for or constructing a water line extension, more than
one hundred percent (100%) of their actual engineering and construction costs,
it being noted that in most cases at least some of the cost would ordinarily be
assessed to the water user's own property.
      3.   Interest: A reimbursement agreement may provide for interest to be
paid to the customer or developer.
      4.   Administrative Fee: The city shall charge a ten percent (10%)
administrative fee for handling the accounting, auditing, and payment of the
reimbursement payments made to the developer or customer so extending the water
line under the reimbursement agreement with the city.
      5.   Nonassignable: The reimbursement agreement shall be personal to the
user entering into it and shall not be assigned without the written consent of
the city, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
      6.   Termination: The agreement will terminate when the user has been
fully reimbursed.
      7.   Binding On Successors: The agreement shall be binding on the water
user and its assigns, successors, heirs, and executors and may be recorded as
an encumbrance against the property of the water user.
   C.   Indemnification: The water user shall be required to indemnify and hold
the city harmless from any and all liability whatsoever until the water line
has been accepted for maintenance by the city; said lines, after acceptance,
shall become part of the city water system and become the sole property of the
city.
   D.   City May Initiate: Where the city constructs a water line extension, in
conjunction with another person or entity, the city may enter into a
reimbursement agreement as authorized above such that the city is reimbursed
for its costs of construction, engineering, legal costs and interest. (Ord.
202, 5-26-1992)

use by the purveyor unless the water supply is protected by backflow prevention
devices whenever required by this article. The installation or maintenance of a
cross connection which will endanger the water quality of the potable water
supply of the city shall be unlawful and is prohibited and shall be penalized
as hereinafter provided. Any such cross connection now existing or hereafter
installed is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the same shall be
abated as provided by law for any public nuisance. The control or elimination
of the cross connections shall be in accordance with this article and the
regulations, together with the latest edition of appropriate manuals of
standard practice pertaining to cross connections control, approved by the
director. The engineer shall have the authority to establish requirements more
stringent than state regulations, if he deems that the conditions so dictate.
Such requirements shall be published and available to the public at the city
hall. The purveyor shall adopt and publish rules and regulations as necessary
to carry out the provisions of this article, and shall have such rules and
regulations available in published form to the public. Backflow prevention
devices required by this article are intended to protect the city of Eagle
municipal water system. Once water, supplied by the city, has been provided to
a customer, and backflow prevention devices have been required and installed by
the customer, that customer shall be responsible for the installation of any
additional, on premises, backflow prevention devices for the further protection
of waters supplied to the premises downstream of the backflow prevention device
required by this article. (Ord. 636, 11-24-2009)
6-5A-3: USE OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   Location Of Backflow Prevention Devices: Backflow prevention devices
shall be installed at the point of entry of any premises where, in the judgment
of the purveyor or the health officer, the nature and extent of the activities
or the materials stored on the premises would present an immediate and/or
dangerous hazard to health and/or be deleterious to the quality of the water
should a cross connection occur; even though such cross connection does not
exist at the time the backflow prevention device shall be installed in all
premises under circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply.
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross connections exist.
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist.
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being
established or reestablished.
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters.
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
or stored in such a manner that if backflow should occur, a serious health
hazard might result.
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public
water supply. A backflow prevention device shall be installed at these
facilities unless the purveyor and the director determine that no hazard
exists:
   Car washes.
   Chemical plants using a water process.
   Fire sprinkler systems.
   Food or beverage processing plants.
   Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics, laboratories.

health officer, where backflow prevention devices are required to protect the
public water supply.
   B.   Type Of Device: The type of protective device required shall depend on
the degree of hazard which exists. The following backflow prevention devices
shall be installed in accordance with the current edition of the "Accepted
Procedures And Practices In Cross Connection Control" manual of the American
Water Works Association or the following requirements whichever is the more
stringent. The following backflow prevention devices shall not be installed in
such a manner as to be subject to flooding, freezing, incidental damage, or
exposed to corrosive fumes:
      1.   Air gap separation: To be installed in situations where elimination
of cross connection or backflow is critical. Separation between the end of the
potable water system and the rim of the receiving vessel, tank, or fixture,
shall be not less than one inch (1") or two (2) times the inside diameter of
the potable water system piping, whichever is greater.
      2.   Reduced pressure backflow assembly: To be installed where the public
water supply may be contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic
nature or other contaminant which, should backflow or cross connection occur,
would create a serious threat to the public water supply. This device shall be
installed, as a unit, between two (2) resilient seated valves, to allow
testing, twelve inches (12") from the finish grade or floor to the bottom of
the backflow assembly and not more than five feet (5') above finish grade. Must

no connection between the distribution system and any pipes, pumps, hydrants,
water loading stations, or tanks whereby unsafe water or other contaminating
materials may be discharged or drawn into a public water system. The water
purveyor is responsible through its cross connection control program to take
reasonable and prudent measures to protect the water system against
contamination and pollution from cross connections through premises isolation
or containment, internal or in plant isolation, fixture protection, or some
combination of premises isolation, internal isolation, and fixture protection.
      1.   Testable Assemblies: All double check valve backflow prevention
assemblies, reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies, spill

tests and maintenance shall be conducted by persons certified by the state of
Idaho and shall be at the customer's expense. Whenever a device is found to be
defective, they shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the customer's
expense. Copies of all test reports shall be sent to the city of Eagle public
works department. Copies of all test reports shall be maintained at the
premises and shall be available for inspection if so requested by the
superintendent or state health official.
   H.   Underground Sprinkling Devices: No underground sprinkling device will
be installed without adequate backflow prevention devices at the point from
which the water for irrigation is taken from the public water supply.
   I.   Termination Of Water Service: Failure of the customer to cooperate in
the installation, maintenance, testing or inspection of backflow prevention
devices required by this article and the regulations, shall be grounds for
termination of water service to the premises. (Ord. 636, 11-24-2009)
6-5A-4: CROSS CONNECTION INSPECTIONS:
   A.   No water shall be delivered to any structure hereafter built within the
city or within areas served by the city water until the same shall have been
inspected by the purveyor for possible cross connections and have been approved
as being free of the same.
   B.   Any construction for industrial or other purposes which is classified
as hazardous facilities pursuant to section 6-5A-3 of this article, where it is
reasonable to anticipate intermittent cross connections, or as determined by
the director, shall be protected by the installation of one or more backflow
prevention devices at the point of entry from the public water supply into the
premises or any other location designated by the purveyor.
   C.   Inspections shall be made periodically of all buildings, structures or
improvements of any nature now receiving water through the city's system, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether cross connections exist. Such inspections
shall be made by the purveyor. Advance notification of inspections for all
properties shall be made in writing no later than five (5) business days prior
to the inspection. Properties which are not made available for inspection may
be deemed a potential cross connection hazard and water services may be
terminated until the required inspection is completed. In such instances that
cross connections are found to exist, those buildings, structures and/or
improvements shall have an established schedule for annual inspections and
reports to be completed by a licensed inspector and sent to the city of Eagle.
(Ord. 636, 11-24-2009)
6-5A-5: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
In the event an improper cross connection is not corrected within the time
limit set by the superintendent, or in the event the purveyor is refused access
to any property for the purpose of determining whether or not cross connections
exist, delivery of water to the property shall cease until the deficiency is
corrected to the purveyor's satisfaction. In addition, the purveyor may effect
the necessary repairs or modifications at the expense of the property owner and
refuse delivery of water to the property until the costs thereof shall have
been paid. (Ord. 636, 11-24-2009)

limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be
returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official. The building
official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not
exceeding 180 calendar days on request by the applicant showing that
circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from
being taken. No application shall be extended more than twice. In order to
renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit
plans and pay a new plan review fee.
IBC section 105.5 is amended to read as follows:
105.5 Expiration. Every permit issued by the building official under the
provisions of this chapter shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180
calendar days from the date of such permit, or if the building or work
authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work
is commenced for a period of 180 calendar days.
The timeframe by which a project shall be deemed to be suspended or abandoned
shall be measured from the date of the last major inspection that resulted in
an approval to move to the next stage of construction by the city of Eagle or
if no inspection has been required then a project shall be deemed to be
suspended 180 calendar days from the date the permit was issued. The major
inspections that can be required from the city of Eagle include grading
inspection, footing/foundation inspection, concrete slab or under-floor
inspection, lowest floor elevation inspection, framing inspection, lath or
gypsum board inspection, fire resistant penetration inspection, energy
efficiency inspection or special inspections. However, the building official
may extend a permit based on a good faith effort made by the permit holder as
determined by the building official. A good faith effort may include but is not
limited to an inspection performed by city inspectors to verify that
substantial amount of code compliant work has been performed and that
significant progress has occurred towards the next stage of inspection.
   a. New Permit Required After Expiration. Before work on the site can be
recommenced after expiration, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so,
and the fee therefor shall be one half the amount required for a new permit
provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work, that the work is still possible given current
conditions, and that work has not been suspended or abandoned for more than one
year from the last recorded major inspection or good faith effort determined by
the building official. In such cases, a new permit shall not be issued after
expiration when the original review was performed using a previously adopted
code.
   If more than one year has passed since the permit has expired or the city
has adopted a new version of the building code, then the applicant shall apply
for a new permit and the plans will be subject to a new plan review process and
related permit fees.
   The building official shall have the authority to deny the new permit which
utilizes the requirements of the expired permit unless the permittee made a
good faith effort to complete the project and reasons beyond their control
resulted in suspension or abandonment of the project. The permittee must show
that the building or work will be duly completed without further delay, if the
building official renews the permit.
   b. Permit Extensions. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply
for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit,
when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this
section. The building official may extend the time for action by the permittee
for a period not exceeding 180 calendar days on written request by the
permittee with written evidence provided demonstrating that a good faith effort
to complete the project has been made and that reasons beyond the control of
the permittee have resulted in a delay. Under no condition shall a permit be
extended more than once.
   c. Demolition And/Or Restoration Of Property After Permit Expiration. Once a
permit has expired and the building official has determined that said permit
shall not be renewed, the permittee/owner shall have 90 calendar days to
demolish any partially erected structures and/or restore the property to the
same condition that it was in at the time of the issuance of the original
permit, or to a condition acceptable to the building official.
   d. Council Action. If the permittee/owner does not return the property to
the condition that it was in at the time the original building permit was
issued, or to a condition acceptable to the building official, then, after
providing adequate notice to the permittee/owner, the building official shall
cause the matter to be heard before city council. The council shall hear the
matter and may order the property to be restored to the same condition it was
in at the time of the issuance of the original building permit, or to the
condition that was ordered by the building official, or any other action it
deems necessary. This action may result in the demolition or restoration of a
structure or portion thereof. A tax lien shall be placed against the property
for any work that the building official must undertake to restore the property.
If demolition/restoration is necessary, the city shall follow the procedure set
forth in the city code for abatement of dangerous buildings.

   R105.3.1.1 Determination Of Substantially Improved Or Substantially Damaged
Existing Buildings In Flood Hazard Areas. For applications for reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of existing buildings or
structures located in an area prone to flooding as established by table R301.2
(1), the Eagle city floodplain administrator shall examine or cause to be
examined the construction documents for the proposed work. For buildings that
have sustained damage of any origin, the value of the proposed work shall
include the cost to repair the building or structure to its pre-damage
condition. All substantially improved or reconstruction of existing structures
shall be made in accordance with the Eagle city flood control ordinance.
IRC section R105.3.2 is amended to read as follows:
   R105.3.2 Time Limitation Of Application. An application for a permit for any
proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of
filing unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has
been issued. The building official is authorized to grant an extension not to
exceed 180 days each. Extensions will only be granted with requests in writing
by the applicant with justifiable cause demonstrated. Applications will not be
granted more than twice.
IRC section R105.5 is amended to read as follows:
   R105.5 Expiration. Every permit issued by the building official under the
provisions of this chapter shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180
calendar days from the date of such permit, or if the building or work
authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work
is commenced for a period of 180 calendar days.
   The timeframe by which a project shall be deemed to be suspended or
abandoned shall be measured from the date of the last major inspection that
resulted in an approval to move to the next stage of construction by the city
of Eagle or if no inspection has been required then a project shall be deemed
to be suspended 180 calendar days from the date the permit was issued. The
major inspections that can be required from the city of Eagle include grading
inspection, footing/foundation inspection, concrete slab or under-floor
inspection, lowest floor elevation inspection, framing inspection, lath or
gypsum board inspection, fire resistant penetration inspection, energy
efficiency inspection and special inspections. However, the building official
may extend a permit based on a good faith effort made by the permit holder as
determined by the building official. A good faith effort may include but is not
limited to an inspection performed by city inspectors to verify that
substantial amount of code compliant work has been performed and that
significant progress has occurred towards the next stage of inspection.
      a. New Permit Required After Expiration. Before work on the site can be
recommenced after expiration, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so,
and the fee therefor shall be one half the amount required for a new permit
provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work, that the work is still possible given current
conditions, and that work has not been suspended or abandoned for more than one
year from the last recorded major inspection or good faith effort determined by
the building official. In such cases, a new permit shall not be issued after
expiration when the original review was performed using a previously adopted
code.
      If more than one year has passed since the permit has expired or the city
has adopted a new version of the building code, then the applicant shall apply
for a new permit and the plans will be subject to a new plan review process and
related permit fees.
      The building official shall have the authority to deny the new permit
which utilizes the requirements of the expired permit unless the permittee made
a good faith effort to complete the project and reasons beyond their control
resulted in suspension or abandonment of the project. The permittee must show
that the building or work will be duly completed without further delay, if the
building official renews the permit.
      b. Permit Extensions. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply
for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit,
when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this
section. The building official may extend the time for action by the permittee
for a period not exceeding 180 calendar days on written request by the
permittee with written evidence provided demonstrating that a good faith effort
to complete the project has been made and that reasons beyond the control of
the permittee have resulted in a delay. Under no condition shall a permit be
extended more than once.
      c. Demolition And/Or Restoration Of Property After Permit Expiration.
Once a permit has expired and the building official has determined that said
permit shall not be renewed, the permittee/owner shall have 90 calendar days to
demolish any partially erected structures and/or restore the property to the
same condition that it was in at the time of the issuance of the original
permit, or to a condition acceptable to the building official.
      d. Council Action. If the permittee/owner does not return the property to
the condition that it was in at the time the original building permit was
issued, or to a condition acceptable to the building official, then, after
providing adequate notice to the permittee/owner, the building official shall
cause the matter to be heard before city council. The city council shall hear
the matter and may order the property to be restored to the same condition it
was in at the time of the issuance of the original building permit, or to the
condition that was ordered by the building official, or any other action it
deems necessary. This action may result in the demolition or restoration of a
structure or portion thereof. A tax lien shall be placed against the property
for any work that the building official must undertake to restore the property.
If demolition/restoration is necessary, the city shall follow the procedure set
forth in the city code and/or as set forth in the Idaho Code addressing
abatement of dangerous or nuisance buildings or property.
IRC section R105.10 Permit Transfer is a new section and reads as follows:
   R105.10 Permit Transfer. A building permit shall be transferable to another
party if such party can provide a document signed and notarized by the original
permit holder consenting to the transfer itself and all agreements and
conditions incorporated into the original permit approval. A permit may also be
transferred back to the property owner or owner's designated legal agent in
cases where the property owner has terminated their legal relationship with
their contractor or owner's designated legal agent. An administrative fee for
the transfer of the permit will be assessed for the work performed by city
staff to facilitate the transfer based on an hourly rate of $50.00.

review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is
done.
   The building official shall not authorize a refund of any fee paid except on
written application filed by the original permittee or owner's representative
not later than 180 days after the date of fee payment.
IRC section R108.6 is a new section to read as follows:
   R108.6 Work Commencing Before Permit Issuance. Any person who commences any
work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system
before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to a special
investigation that shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work.
   An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected
whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee
shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee required by this code or as set
by resolution of the city council. The payment of such investigation fee shall
not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code
nor from any penalty prescribed by law.

building official. The building official, upon notification, shall make the
requested inspections and shall either indicate the portion of the construction
that is satisfactory as completed, or shall notify the permit holder or an
agent of the permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with this code. Any
portions that do not comply shall be corrected and such portion shall not be
covered or concealed until authorized by the building official. A final
inspection and approval is required upon completion and prior to occupancy and
use of all building and structures.
IRC section R110.4 is amended to read as follows:
   R110.4 Temporary Occupancy. If the building official finds that no
substantial hazard will result from occupancy of any building or portion
thereof before the same is completed, a temporary certificate of occupancy may
be issued for the use of a portion or portions of a building or structure prior
to the completion of the entire building or structure. A temporary occupancy is
set at a time period of 90 days. Multiple time extensions of a maximum of 90
days each may be granted when requested in writing to the building official
when justifiable cause is demonstrated by the permit holder. In no case shall a
temporary occupancy extend beyond one (1) year unless approved by the building
official and the city council.

standards by which the city may require that those who benefit from new growth
and development pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities
needed to serve new growth and development;
   C.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are
required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public
facilities needed to serve new growth and development and to prevent duplicate
and ad hoc development requirements;
   D.   Collect and expend development impact fees pursuant to the enabling
powers granted by the provision of the Idaho development impact fee act, title
67, chapter 82, Idaho Code;
   E.   Provide the legal and procedural basis for the implementation of
development impact fees within the area of city impact; and
   F.   Ensure that any capital improvement funded wholly or in part with
impact fee revenue shall first be included in an approved capital improvements
plan that lists the capital improvements that may be funded with impact fee
revenues as well as the estimated costs and timing for each improvement. (Ord.

835, 11-10-2020)
7-6-6: CALCULATION OF FEE:
   A.   Time Frame: The City shall calculate the amount of the park and pathway
impact fee and police impact fee due for each building permit and manufactured/
mobile home installation permit by the procedure set forth in the "study"
within thirty (30) days of submittal of complete permit plans for residential
development.
   B.   Validity: The calculation of a development impact fee shall be in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A development impact
fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in an
incidental benefit to owners or developers within the service area other than

   C.   Improvements And Expansions: A development impact fee shall be
calculated on the basis of levels of service for police, public park facilities
and public pathway facilities adopted in this chapter and in the "study" that
are applicable to existing development as well as new growth and development.
The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing
police facilities, public park facilities and public pathway facilities for
which a development impact fee is imposed must be attributable to the capacity
demands generated by the new development.
   D.   Multiple Uses: (Rep. by Ord. 358, 11-23-1999)
   E.   Certification: Prior to making an application for a building permit
manufactured/mobile home installation permit, a prospective applicant may
request in writing a written certification of the development impact fee
schedule or individual assessment for a particular project which shall
establish the development fee for a period of one (1) year from the date of
certification. The certification shall include an explanation of facilities
considered under section 67-8207, Idaho Code. The certification shall specify
the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used.
   F.   Individual Assessment: Individual assessment of impact fees is
permitted in situations where the fee payer, at fee payer's expense, can prove
by clear and convincing evidence that the established impact fee is
inappropriate.
      1.   Individual assessments of development impact fees may be made by
application to the City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, prior to
receiving building permits manufactured/mobile home installation permits, or
other necessary approvals from the City. The City Clerk, or his or her duly
designated agent, shall evaluate such individual assessments under the
guidelines provided for in subsection F4 of this section. If the guidelines are
met, the individual assessment shall be approved by the City Clerk, or his or
her duly designated agent. Any decision regarding a request for an individual
assessment shall be provided in writing to the applicant and a copy of said
decision, along with supporting documentation, shall be provided to the City
Council within thirty (30) days of the decision.
      2.   Late applications for individual assessments may be submitted within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer
makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were not known or
discoverable prior to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
      3.   The City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall render a
written decision regarding the individual assessment and forward it to the City
Council within thirty (30) days of the date a complete application is
submitted. The decision of the City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent,
shall establish the impact fee for the project in question for a period of one
(1) year from the date said decision becomes final.
      4.   The City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall evaluate
an application for individual assessment and may approve the same if fee payer
has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the established impact fee is
inappropriate and that the following facts and conditions exist:
         a.   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to
the development that do not apply generally to other properties in the vicinity
of the development.
         b.   An individual assessment is necessary for the reasonable and
acceptable development of the property.
         c.   The approval of the individual assessment will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity in
which the development is located.
         d.   The approval of the individual assessment will not adversely
affect the relevant Capital Improvements Plan for which the impact fee is being
collected.
      5.   Appeals from the City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent,
determination of individual assessment shall be made to the City Council by the
filing of an appeal with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of
mailing, faxing, or personal delivery of written notice of the decision of the
City Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent. Final determination regarding
the appeal of individual assessments shall be made by the City Council. (Ord.
345, 5-11-1999; amd. Ord. 775, 5-9-2017; Ord. 835, 11-10-2020)
7-6-7: GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION:
   A.   Amount Of Impact Fee: The amount of the impact fee shall be calculated
using the methodology contained in the "study".
   B.   Fee Not To Exceed: A development impact fee shall not exceed a
proportionate share of the cost of system improvements determined in accordance
with section 67-8207, Idaho Code. Development impact fees shall be based on
actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
   C.   Payment By Developer: A developer shall have the right to elect to pay
a project's proportionate share of police, park and pathway system improvement
costs by payment of development impact fees according to the fee schedule as
full and complete payment of the development project's proportionate share of
system improvement costs, except as provided in section 67-8214(3), Idaho Code.
The schedule of police, park and pathway facilities development impact fees for
various land uses per unit of development shall be as set forth in the "study".
   D.   Proportionate Share Determination:
      1.   All development impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair
formula or method under which the development impact fee imposed does not
exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the
City in the provision of system improvements to serve the new development. The
proportionate share is the cost attributable to the new development after the
City considers the following:
         a.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money,
dedication of land, or construction of system improvements;
         b.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees, debt service payments, or taxes which
are dedicated for system improvements for which development impact fees would
otherwise be imposed; and
         c.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
      2.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the City:
         a.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area
or areas;
         b.   The means by which existing system improvements have been
financed;
         c.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the
cost of system improvements through taxation, assessments, or developer or
landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system
improvements through developer or landowner contributions;
         d.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
         e.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area or areas;
         f.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
         g.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         h.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. The City shall develop a
plan for alternative sources of revenue, which shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, plans generated during the City's annual budget
process, lobbying efforts, tax increment financing, implementation of user fees
and various forms of utilities. (Ord. 345, 5-11-1999; amd. Ord. 775, 5-9-2017;
Ord. 835, 11-10-2020)
7-6-8: ADMINISTRATION OF FEE:
   A.   Transfer Of Funds To City Clerk: Upon receipt of impact fees, the City
Clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall be responsible for placement
of such funds into separate accounts as hereinafter specified. All such funds
shall be deposited in interest bearing accounts, within the Capital Projects
Fund, in a bank authorized to receive deposits of City funds. Interest earned
by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for
the purposes specified for funds of such account.
   B.   Establishment And Maintenance Of Accounts: The city clerk, or his or
her duly designated agent, shall establish separate accounts and maintain
records for each such account whereby impact fees collected can be segregated.
   C.   Maintenance Of Records: The city clerk, or his or her duly designated
agent, shall maintain and keep accurate financial records for each such account
that shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues; that shall account
for all monies received; that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from
each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of projects
specified in the capital improvements program; and that shall provide an annual
accounting for each impact fee account showing the source and amount of all
funds collected and the projects that were funded.
   D.   System And Service Area Improvements: Development impact fees shall
only be spent for the category of system improvements for which the fees are
collected and either within or for the benefit of the service area in which the
project is located.
   E.   Review And Modification: Unless the city council deems some other time
period is appropriate, the city shall at least once every five (5) years
commencing from the date of the original adoption of the capital improvements
plan, review the development potential of the area and update the capital
improvements plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in Idaho Code
section 67-8206. The city may make any updates as are deemed necessary as a
result of: 1) development occurring in the prior year; 2) capital improvements
actually constructed; 3) changing facility needs; 4) inflation; 5) revised cost
estimates for capital improvements; 6) changes in the availability of other
funding projects; and 7) such other factors as may be relevant.
   F.   Capital Budget: The city shall annually adopt a capital budget.
   G.   Audit Process: As part of its annual audit process, the city shall
prepare an annual study describing the amount of all development impact fees
collected, appropriated, or spent during the preceding year by category of
public facility and service area.
   H.   Other Requirements: All other requirements of Idaho Code 67-8210,
regarding earmarking and expenditure of collected development impact fees,
shall apply. (Ord. 345, 5-11-1999)
7-6-9: CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENT:
   A.   In the calculation of development impact fees for a particular project,
credit or reimbursement shall be given for the present value of any
construction of system improvements or contribution or dedication of land or
money required by the city from a developer for system improvements of the
category for which the development impact fee is being collected. Credit or
reimbursement shall not be given for project improvements.
   B.   If a developer is required to construct, fund or contribute system
improvements in excess of the development project's proportionate share of
system improvement costs, the developer shall receive a credit on future impact
fees or be reimbursed at the developer's choice for such excess construction,
funding or contribution from development impact fees paid by future development
which impacts the system improvements constructed, funded or contributed by the
developer(s) or fee payer. (Ord. 345, 5-11-1999)
   C.   To be equitable, impact fees must avoid double charging. Impact fees
are structured to credit fee payers for taxes or fees they have paid or will
pay for the same services. General tax credits for future annual tax and fee
payments are expressed as an equivalent, current lump sum payment, and deducted
from the one time gross impact fee. The city calculates the impact fee
utilization projection included as an appendix to the study and updated yearly
at the time of the annual budget.
   D.   If credit or reimbursement is due to the developer pursuant to this
section, the city shall enter into a written agreement, with the fee payer,
negotiated in good faith, prior to the construction, funding or contribution.
The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount, time and
form of reimbursement.
   E.   No credits shall be given for the construction of local on site
facilities, structures, improvements, or other project improvements required by
zoning, subdivision, or other city regulations unless the improvement is
identified in the "Study" as a system improvement.
   F.   Any person requesting such credit or reimbursement shall submit their
request in writing on a form provided by the city and present documentation of
costs or payments for facilities to the city clerk, or his or her duly
designated agent, prior to issuance of a building permit or manufactured/mobile
home installation permit. The determination shall be made no more than forty
five (45) days after complete documentation is submitted to the city clerk, or
his or her duly designated agent. Any appeal from such a determination by the
city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall be pursuant to section
7-6-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 358, 11-23-1999)
7-6-10: REFUNDS:

fee has been paid may request a refund of such fee if:
      1.   Service is available but never provided;
      2.   The project for which a building permit has been used has been
lawfully altered resulting in a decrease in the amount of the impact fee due;
      3.   The city, after collecting the fee when service is not available,
has failed to appropriate and expend the collected development impact fees
pursuant to section 67-8210(4) Idaho Code; or
      4.   A building permit or permit for installation of a manufactured/
mobile home is denied or abandoned.
   B.   The request for refund must be filed in writing and submitted to the
city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, on a form provided by the city

the owner of record within ninety (90) days after it is determined that a
refund is due. A refund shall include a refund of interest at one-half (1/2)
the legal rate provided for in section 28-22-104, Idaho Code.
   E.   Owner may appeal the determination of the city clerk, or his or her
duly designated agent, to the city council pursuant to the provisions in
section
7-6-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 345, 5-11-1999)
7-6-11: APPEALS:
   A.   Appeal Of Written Determination: A developer or fee payer may appeal
the written determination of the applicability and amount of the development
impact fee, or refund, or any discretionary action or inaction by or on behalf

CHAPTER 2
ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
SECTION:
8-2-1: Districts Established, Purposes And Restrictions
8-2-2: Official Zoning Map; Incorporation By Reference
8-2-3: Schedule Of District Use Regulations
8-2-4: Schedule Of Building Height And Lot Area Regulations
8-2-1: DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED, PURPOSES AND RESTRICTIONS:
The following zoning districts are hereby established. For the interpretation
of this title, the zoning districts have been formulated to realize the general
purposes as set forth in this title. In addition, the specific purpose of each
zoning district shall be as follows:
A AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT: To maximize opportunities for agricultural activities
by preserving land for the purposes of cultivating the soil and raising
livestock. Minimum lot size of twenty (20) contiguous acres, all of which must
be under single ownership to ensure protection of irrigation and surface water
drainage systems.
A-R AGRICULTURAL-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT: To provide for the transition of
agricultural land no longer used for extensive agricultural purposes into
residential areas, while preserving agricultural uses compatible with
residential development. Gross density shall not exceed one single-family
dwelling unit per five (5) acres.
R-E RESIDENTIAL-ESTATES DISTRICT: To provide opportunities for very low density
residential land use compatible with the topography and public service
capacities. Gross density shall not exceed one single-family dwelling unit per
two (2) acres.
R RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT: To provide regulations and districts for various
residential neighborhoods. Gross density in an R district shall be determined
according to the numeral following the R. The numeral designates the maximum
number of dwelling units per acre. Multi-family and two-family units/
developments are prohibited in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 zoning districts,
unless approved as part of a planned unit development (PUD). Centralized water
and sewer facilities are required for all subdivision and parcel division
applications submitted after the effective date hereof in all zoning districts
except the city council may permit the use of individual well(s) and septic
system(s) in the A, A-R and R-E zoning districts upon a determination that the
public health, safety, and welfare will not be negatively impacted. Whenever
there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this section and
those of other chapters and/or other titles, the chapter or title with the more
restrictive provision shall prevail. When a property is being proposed for
rezone to the R zoning district, a development agreement may be utilized in
lieu of the PUD and/or conditional use process if approved by the city council,
provided the development agreement includes conditions of development that are
required during the PUD and conditional use process.
L-O LIMITED OFFICE DISTRICT: To permit the establishment of groupings of
professional, research, executive, administrative, accounting, clerical,
stenographic, limited commercial and similar uses. Development shall not be
traffic intensive and research facilities shall not involve heavy testing
operations of any kind. The L-O district is designed to act as a buffer between
other more intense nonresidential uses and high density residential uses, and
is thus a transitional use.
C-A COMMERCIAL-AIRPORT: To permit the establishment of a commercial airport
which is compatible with property uses in other Eagle area districts.
C-1 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT: To permit the establishment of convenience
business uses which tend to meet the daily needs of the residents of an
immediate neighborhood while establishing development standards that prevent
adverse effects on residential uses adjoining a C-1 district. Such districts
are typically appropriate for small shopping clusters or integrated shopping
centers located within residential neighborhoods.
C-2 GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT: To permit the establishment of areas for
commercial uses allowed in other commercial zones and commercial uses which are
more intensive than those permitted in other commercial zones. Uses that
complement rather than compete with the uses allowed within the CBD zoning
district shall be encouraged.
C-3 HIGHWAY BUSINESS DISTRICT: To permit the establishment of areas for travel
related services such as hotels, motels, service stations, drive-in
restaurants, offices, limited warehousing, commercial services and retail
sales. This district is specifically designed in clusters to service the
motoring public on major streets. Uses that compete with the uses allowed
within the CBD zoning district shall be discouraged.
CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT: To accommodate and encourage further expansion
and renewal in the historical core business area of the community. A variety of
business, public, quasi- public, cultural, residential and other related uses
are encouraged. The greatest possible concentration of retail sales and
business is to occur in this district. Pedestrian friendly uses and
developments are encouraged.
M-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT: To encourage the development of manufacturing
and wholesale business establishments which shall be free of hazardous or
objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare, are operated
entirely within enclosed structures and generate little industrial traffic.
Research activities are encouraged and limited office and commercial uses may
be permitted as ancillary uses. This district is further designed to act as a
transitional use between heavy manufacturing uses and other less intense
businesses.
BP BUSINESS PARK DISTRICT: To encourage the development of technical park/
research and development facilities, offices and office complexes, and limited
manufacturing activities including small scale production, distribution and
storage of goods. Support activities may also be permitted. All development
within this district shall be designed to be within a landscaped setting, and
be free of hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke
or glare. Such development shall be operated entirely within enclosed
structures, and generate minimal industrial traffic. All development requiring
a conditional use permit in the BP zoning district, as shown in section
8-2-3 of this chapter, shall occur under the PUD and/or development agreement
process in accordance with chapter 6 or 10 of this title unless the proposed
development does not meet the area requirements as set forth in section
8-6-5-1 of this title. In that case a cooperative development, in conjunction
with adjacent parcels (to meet the minimum area requirements), shall be
encouraged. Otherwise a conditional use permit shall be required unless the
proposed use is shown as a permitted use in the BP zoning district within
section
8-2-3 of this chapter.
M-2 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT: To encourage the development of major
manufacturing, processing, warehousing and major research and testing
operations. Limited office and commercial uses may be permitted as ancillary
uses. These activities shall include certain uses excluded from the M-
1 district for reasons of health, safety or general welfare. All development
within this land use shall be free of hazardous or objectionable elements such
as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare.
M-3 EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT: To provide land for the mining, processing
and storage of mineral resources. This district is designed to assure that
these resources be properly managed and all land be reclaimed so as not to
create a hazard or nuisance which either immediately or in the future adversely
affects the health, safety or general welfare of the community.
PS PUBLIC/SEMIPUBLIC: To provide for public/semipublic development such as golf
courses, parks, recreation facilities, greenways, schools, and public service
facilities such as government offices. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
MU MIXED USE DISTRICT: To provide for a variety and mixture of uses such as
limited office, limited commercial, and residential. This district is intended
to ensure compatibility of new development with existing and future
development. It is also intended to ensure assemblage of properties in a
unified plan with coordinated and harmonious development which shall promote
outstanding design without unsightly and unsafe strip commercial development.
Uses should complement the uses allowed within the CBD zoning district. All
development requiring a conditional use permit in the MU zoning district, as
shown in section
8-2-3 of this chapter, shall occur under the PUD and/or development agreement
process in accordance with chapter 6 or 10 of this title unless the proposed
development does not meet the area requirements as set forth in section
8-6-5-1 of this title. In that case a cooperative development, in conjunction
with adjacent parcels (to meet the minimum area requirements), shall be
encouraged. Otherwise a conditional use permit shall be required unless the
proposed use is shown as a permitted use in the MU zoning district within
section
8-2-3 of this chapter. Residential densities shall not exceed twenty (20)
dwelling units per gross acre. When a property is being proposed for rezone to
the MU zoning district, a development agreement may be utilized in lieu of the
PUD and/or conditional use process if approved by the city council, provided
the development agreement includes conditions of development that are required
during the PUD and conditional use process. (Ord. 673, 11-27-2012)
DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT: To guide the general appearance of building and
improvements to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive plan or other
development plans as adopted by the council. This district is superimposed over
all other districts within the entire city limits.
P PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: This designation, following any zoning designation
noted on the official zoning map of the city (i.e., R-4-P), indicates that the
development was approved by the city as a planned unit development. Density
transfers may have been permitted as a part of the overall development.
DA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT: This designation, following any zoning designation
noted on the official zoning map of the city (i.e., C-2-DA), indicates that the
zoning was approved by the city with a development agreement. Specific
provisions, as may have been incorporated within the development agreement, are
applicable to development within this zoning designation. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007;
amd. Ord. 673, 11-27-2012; Ord. 826, 7-28-2020; Ord. 868, 8-8-2022)

   B.   Boundaries Of Districts: Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
boundaries of any of the zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map,
the following shall apply:
      1.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the centerline of street lines, highway right of way lines, streams, lakes or
other bodies of water, the centerline shall be construed to be such boundary;
      2.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries;
      3.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the
centerlines or right of way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall
be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as

shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning map;
and
      4.   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of said
railroad line. (Ord. 298, 10-14-1997)
8-2-3: SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT USE REGULATIONS:
District regulations shall be as set forth in the official schedule of district
regulations, in the performance standards in chapter 3 of this title, and as
otherwise provided within this code. The official schedule of district
regulations is divided into five (5) land use groups: agricultural,
residential, commercial, industrial, and public/semipublic. To determine in
which district a specific use is allowed:
   A.   Find the use in one of the land use groups;
   B.   Read across the chart until either "P" or "C" appears in one of the
columns; and
   C.   If "P" appears, the use is an allowed use; if "C" appears, the use is
only allowed upon the issuance of a conditional use permit and/or a development
agreement upon rezone to an MU or BP zoning designation; if no letter appears
the use is prohibited.
If a proposed use is not specifically listed in the chart below then the use is
prohibited. When several combined land uses exist, or are proposed, the most
intensive land use shall be considered as the primary activity.

8-2A-5: DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICTS; EAGLE ARCHITECTURE AND SITE DESIGN
BOOK (EASD):
   A.   Area Of District: The Design Review Overlay District encompasses the
entire City limits including any land annexed into the City after the date of
adoption hereof.
   B.   Proposed Developments: Any proposed development located within the
Design Review Overlay District shall be harmonious with and in accordance with
the general objectives and with any specific objective of the Comprehensive
Plan.
   C.   Areas Of Development: There are four (4) specifically defined areas of
development within the Design Review Overlay District. The general purpose of
each of those areas are described below. Any development which meets the
criteria for design review, as set forth in this article, that is not within
the specific areas described below, shall be required to comply with the
general requirements of this article and not the specific requirements for the
DDA, TDA, CEDA, and DSDA:
      1.   Downtown Development Area-DDA: The purpose of the DDA is to
establish a distinct area regulated to fulfill the vision of the City
Comprehensive Plan and to provide for activities conducive to a compact and
concentrated downtown commercial center.
      2.   Transitional Development Area-TDA: The purpose of the TDA is to
provide areas for public parking and service to the DDA and serve as an area
for future expansion of the DDA as market demands grow.
      3.   Community Entry Development Area-CEDA: The purpose of the CEDA is to
fulfill the vision of the City Comprehensive Plan by providing a sense of entry
into Eagle and transitional development into the DDA.
      4.   Dunyon/State Development Area-DSDA: The purpose of the DSDA is to
allow unique regulations specific to this district to facilitate the
redevelopment of the area.
Where any parcel lies within more than one (1) development area described
above, the entire parcel shall be considered to be within the development area
with the more restrictive requirements. However, the development of a parcel
located within more than one (1) development area may be permitted using the
criteria from each respective district provided the Design Review Board
determines that the more restrictive criteria is not compromised and that the
development is in harmony with the adjacent properties.
   D.   Area Boundaries: The DDA, TDA, CEDA and DSDA are delineated on the map
(Exhibit A-1) included as part of EASD Book.
   E.   Eagle Architecture And Site Design Book-EASD: The purpose of the EASD
Book is to show, through the use of pictures and text, specific period
architectural styles, themes, and elements envisioned through the requirements
of this article. The EASD Book, established through a resolution of the City
Council and as may be amended through future resolution(s), contains all
exhibits referenced in this article and is incorporated herein by reference.
However, Exhibit A-1 may only be modified through an ordinance amendment. The
architecture styles found in the EASD Book are permitted styles. Architectural
styles not shown within the EASD Book will not be considered. A copy of the
EASD Book is available at Eagle City Hall. (Ord. 462, 11-11-2003)
8-2A-6: DESIGN REQUIREMENTS, OBJECTIVES AND CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   General Objectives And Considerations: The following apply to the
entire Design Review Overlay District including the DDA, TDA, CEDA, and DSDA.
Additional requirements for the DDA, TDA, CEDA, and DSDA are set forth in
subsections C through G of this section and, to the extent there is a conflict
with this section, the requirements for the DDA, TDA, CEDA, and DSDA shall
control. The following, including the provisions set forth in the Eagle
Architecture and Site Design Book, contains a listing of objectives applied to
each application, and a listing of matters which shall be considered by the
Design Review Board. The objectives are separated into two (2) sections: site
design and building design. Specific aspects of design should be examined to
determine whether the proposed development will provide a desirable environment
for its occupants as well as for its neighbors, and whether, aesthetically, the
composition, materials, textures and colors meet the intent of this article.
The design review board shall consider the following criteria in reviewing the
application:
      1.   Site Design Objectives: The site plan design shall minimize impact
of traffic on adjacent streets, provide for the pedestrian, and provide
appropriate, safe parking lot design.
         a.   The functional relationship of the structures and the site in
relation to its surroundings;
         b.   The impact and effect of the site development plan on traffic
conditions on contiguous streets and adjoining properties or neighborhoods;
         c.   The site layout with respect to separation or integration of
vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic patterns;
         d.   The arrangement and adequacy of off street parking facilities
relative to access points, building location and total site development to
prevent traffic conflict or congestion;
         e.   The location, arrangement and dimensions of truck loading ramps,
docks, and bays and vehicle service facilities;
         f.   The access, parking lot, and interior roadway illumination plans
and hours of operation;
         g.   The required driver, pedestrian and bicycle sight distance
requirements of the project and their relationship to adjacent streets,
driveways and properties;
         h.   The coordination of the site development with planned right of
way alignments, acquisitions and street improvements;
         i.   The graphic delineation of traffic circulation patterns to avoid
confusion, congestion and conflicts;
         j.   The continued maintenance of traffic, parking and lighting
systems;
         k.   The protection of views and vistas in relation to urban design
and aesthetic considerations; and
         l.   The provision of safe pedestrian and bicycle connections between
neighborhoods and commercial areas.
      2.   Site Landscaping: The site landscaping shall minimize impact on
adjacent properties through the proper use of screening with sound and sight
buffers, and unsightly areas shall be concealed or screened and the design
review board shall consider:
         a.   The location, height, and materials of walls, fences, hedges and
screen plantings to ensure harmony with adjacent development;
         b.   The location and type of new plantings, with due regard to
preservation of specimen and landmark trees, and to maintenance of all
plantings;
         c.   The providing of screen plantings or other screening methods
reasonably required to conceal outdoor storage areas, trash receptacles,
service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and other unsightly
developments;
         d.   The installation of sound and sight buffers, the preservation of
public views, light and air, and the consideration of those landscape aspects
of design which may have substantial effects on neighborhood development, land
uses, and amenities;
         e.   The design and use of open spaces and parks; and
         f.   The permanent maintenance of all landscaped areas and fencing.
      3.   Site Grading And Drainage: The on site grading and drainage shall be
designed so as to maximize land use benefits and to minimize off site impact
and provide for slope and soil stabilization to prevent erosion and the design
review board shall consider:
         a.   The existing and proposed grading relative to soil removal, fill
work, retainage, soil stabilization, erosion control on the site and the
adjacent terrain and streets, and adoption of the development to the existing
site contours;
         b.   The planting of ground covers or shrubbery to prevent dust, to
stabilize soils and embankments and to control erosion;
         c.   Existing and proposed storm drainageways, canals, floodway and
floodplains relative to flow or alignment alterations, containment and
endangerment of health; and
         d.   The maintenance of floodway, floodplains, drainageways, channels,
culverts, head gates, canals, and soils.
      4.   Signage: Signing for any project shall provide for business
identification and minimize clutter and confusion on and off the site, and
shall be in compliance with section 8-2A-8 of this article and the current
edition of the uniform sign code adopted by the city. The design review board
shall consider:
         a.   The "overall sign concept" for multi-tenant business centers to
assure that it addresses the continuity between tenant sign design and building
design;
         b.   The reduction of hazards to motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians
as may be caused by or partially attributable to the distraction and
obstruction of improperly located and designed signs;
         c.   The provision for effective and necessary business identification
systems adapted to the building design;
         d.   The continued maintenance of signs throughout their life; and
         e.   The size, location, design, color, texture, lighting,
landscaping, and hours of operations of all permanent signs and outdoor
advertising structures or features to ensure that any such proposals do not
detract from the function of, or design of, buildings, structures, surrounding
properties, neighborhoods, or streets.
      5.   Utilities: Utility service systems shall not detract from building
or site design. Cable, electrical, and telephone service systems shall be
installed underground, and the design review board shall consider:
         a.   Size and location of all service systems for appropriate
appearance and maintenance accessibility;
         b.   The location and design of transformers, pad mount and roof

   G.   Maintenance:
      1.   All required landscaping shall be permanently maintained in a
healthy growing condition by the property owner or the property owner's
representative. This includes the maintenance of street trees and/or other
landscape materials within or abutting the public right of way adjacent to the
subject property. The property owner shall remove, and if required to meet the
standards of these requirements, shall replace any unhealthy or dead plant
material immediately or as the planting season permits. In all cases,
maintenance and planting within public rights of way shall be with approval
from the public and/or private entities owning the property.
   H.   Completion Time:
      1.   The zoning administrator may authorize a delay in the completion of

water demand landscape areas shall be circuited so that they are on a separate
zone or zones from those irrigating trees, shrubbery or other reduced water
demand areas.
      5.   Sprinkler heads shall be placed as required to reduce direct
overthrow onto nonpervious areas (walks, drives, etc.).
      6.   The use of low trajectory spray nozzles is encouraged in order to
reduce the effect of wind velocity on the spray system.
      7.   Use of nonpotable water for use in the irrigation of lawn and plant
material is required when determined to be available.
      8.   All nonpotable water access points shall be clearly and permanently
labeled with markers indicating that the water is not safe for human
consumption.
      9.   Maintain all irrigation systems to ensure proper operation and water
conservation.
   J.   Buffer Areas/Common Lots:
      1.   Definition: A transition zone or buffer area consists of horizontal
space (land) and vertical elements (plants, berms, fences, or walls). The
purpose of such buffer space is to physically separate and visually screen
adjacent land uses which are not fully compatible due to differing facilities,
activities, or different intensities of use, such as townhouses and a
convenience store, or a high volume roadway and residential dwellings.

with a fence or decorative wall.
         c.   The required buffer area shall result in an effective barrier
within three (3) years and be maintained such that sixty percent (60%) or more
of the vertical surface is closed and prevents the passage of vision through
it.
         d.   Chainlink fencing, with slats or otherwise, and cedar fencing is
prohibited for screening.
      4.   Major Roadways: New residential developments, including, but not
limited to, subdivisions and multi-family developments, shall be buffered from
streets classified as collectors, arterials, freeways, or expressways, to
protect residential communities from noisy, potentially dangerous, high speed
roads. The "buffer area" shall be defined as a common lot located between the
residential lots within the subdivision and the right of way line of the
adjacent roadway. This buffer is required as part of the common area open space
owned and maintained by a homeowners' association. Any landscaping proposed to
be within the public right of way shall not be included as a part of the buffer
area required below. The height for berming/fencing, as noted below, shall be
measured from the elevation of the final grade of the adjacent roadway
(measured at the centerline) to the top of the proposed berming/fencing. The
required buffer area width, plantings, and fencing are as follows:
         a.    Any road designated as a collector on the master street map

         a.   For design flexibility, half of the required shade trees may be
substituted on a two to one (2:1) basis with ornamental and evergreen trees.
         b.   Buffer areas should include a variety of species, arranged to
create varied and attractive views. Open fences, decorative walls, and berms
may be used. Height changes, offset angles, different materials, and other
design techniques are required so as to create variety.
   K.   Parking Lot Landscaping:
      1.   Visual Impact: Landscaping shall be provided to minimize the visual
impact of off street parking:
Parking should be located to the side and rear of buildings and shall be
screened so that it does not dominate the streetscape. Fences, hedges, berms,
and landscaping may be used to screen parking areas (chainlink fencing shall
not be permitted). In the design of large parking areas, arrange bays of
parking spaces to be separated by landscaping. When parking lots occur on
sloping terrain, step the parking lots to follow the terrain rather than
allowing the lot surface to extend above natural grade.
      2.   Parking Lot Landscape Strip: A landscape strip shall be provided
when a parking lot is located adjacent to a public right of way. The landscaped
strip shall serve to shield views of parked cars to passing motorists and
pedestrians, and to establish coordination among architecturally diverse
buildings, which creates a pleasing, harmonious appearance along the roadway.
      Four (4) options are provided for fulfilling this requirement:
         a.   Provide a ten foot (10') wide landscaped strip between the right
of way and the parking lot, and plant with a minimum of one shade tree and ten
(10) shrubs per thirty five (35) linear feet of frontage, excluding driveway
openings.
         b.   Provide an earth berm of thirty inches (30") minimum height (do
not exceed 3:1 slope) within a ten foot (10') wide landscaped strip between the
right of way and the parking lot, and plant with a minimum of one shade tree
and five (5) shrubs per thirty five (35) linear feet of frontage, excluding
driveway openings.
         c.   Provide a six foot (6') landscaped strip with a minimum thirty
inch (30") grade drop from the right of way to the parking lot, and plant with
a minimum of one shade tree and five (5) shrubs per thirty five (35) linear
feet of frontage, excluding driveway openings.
         d.   Provide a three foot (3') high fence of wood, brick, stone, or
decorative block or concrete along with a four foot (4') wide landscaped strip
between the right of way and the parking lot, and plant a minimum of one shade
tree and five (5) shrubs per thirty five (35) linear feet of frontage,
excluding driveway openings.
      (1)   The board may waive the requirement for a wood, brick, stone,
decorative block or concrete fence if the board finds the following:
               (A)   The applicant must design, document, and obtain city
approval representing that the overall planting design, at the time of
planting, results in an effective barrier such that the landscape strip shields
the view of parked cars from passing pedestrians and motorists; and
               (B)   Any such proposed design alternative is compatible with
the overall site design of the entire project and is compatible with the
surrounding area.
      3.   Parking Lot Perimeter Landscaping: Perimeter landscaping
requirements define parking areas and prevent two (2) adjacent lots from
becoming one large expanse of paving. This requirement does not hinder the
ability to provide vehicular access between lots.
         a.   Provide a minimum five foot (5') wide perimeter landscaped strip
between the property lines and the parking lot, and plant with a minimum of one
shade tree and five (5) shrubs per thirty five (35) linear feet of perimeter.
      4.   Parking Lot Interior Landscaping:
         a.   Calculated Amount: Interior parking lot landscaping shall be
required on any parking lot with ten (10) spaces and above. The required amount
of landscaping is based on a sliding scale, as follows:
 
Total Number Of Spaces Percent Of Total Area Of A Lot That Must Be An Interior
                       Landscaped Area
    10 - 20        5 percent
    21 - 50        8 percent
    51+            10 percent
 
         b.   Additional Requirements:
            (1)   No interior planter shall be less than five feet (5') in any
dimension.
            (2)   No parking space shall be more than sixty feet (60') from an
interior landscaped area.
            (3)   Parking islands are to be as evenly spaced as feasible
throughout the lot to consistently reduce the visual impact of long rows of
parked cars.
            (4)   Deciduous shade trees and ground covers or low shrubs are
recommended as primary plantings in interior landscaped areas. Deciduous shade
trees are to be clear branched to a height of six feet (6').
            (5)   A terminal island for a single row of parking spaces shall be
landscaped with at least one tree and shrubs, ground cover, or grass. A
terminal island for a double row of parking spaces shall contain not less than
two (2) trees and shrubs, ground cover, or grass.
   L.   Landscaped Commercial Strips:
      1.   Landscaped strips shall be provided between all building development
and public rights of way to lend continuity among different architectural
styles, screen unsightly views, establish a pleasing view for motorists, and
create a safe and pleasant corridor for pedestrians.
         a.   The landscaped strip shall be ten feet (10') wide minimum and
planted with one shade tree and ten (10) shrubs for every thirty five feet
(35') of street frontage. Two (2) ornamental or two (2) evergreen trees may be
substituted for one shade tree.
   M.   Parkway Strips, Separated Sidewalks, And Street Trees:
      1. Except as may otherwise be required within the DDA, TDA, CEDA, and
DSDA sidewalks shall be separated from the curb along all streets. An eight
foot (8') wide minimum parkway planter strip planted with shade class (class
II) trees shall be required between the sidewalk and street to provide a canopy
effect over streets.
      2.   In all required applications, excluding residential developments,
one street tree, selected from the approved tree list in subsection Q of this
section, shall be planted per thirty five (35) linear feet of street frontage.
      3.   Within residential developments one shade class (class II) tree
selected from the approved tree list in subsection Q of this section shall be
located on both sides of all streets within the eight foot (8') wide landscape
strip between the sidewalk and the curb. Trees shall be planted at the front of
each lot generally located on each side lot line corner with the distance
between trees to be a minimum of thirty five feet (35') and a maximum of eighty
feet (80') of street frontage.
      4.   In all cases, any planting within public rights of way shall be with
approval from the public and/or private entities owning the property.
   N.   Incentives:
      1.   The zoning administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by
up to five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed
landscape plan incorporates the retention of existing significant trees,
particularly in the interior of the site.
      2.   The zoning administrator may reduce the site parking requirements by
up to five percent (5%) of the required number of spaces if the proposed
landscaping exceeds the requirements of these guidelines by fifteen percent
(15%) or more.
      3.   The zoning administrator may reduce technical standards of parking
lot design where paving requirements conflict with the retention of significant
trees.
   O.   Alternative Methods Of Compliance:
      1.   Project Conditions: It is not the intent of these landscape
requirements to inhibit creative solutions to land use problems. Under certain
site conditions, a strict interpretation of requirements may be either
physically impossible or impractical. Alternative compliance is a procedure
that allows certain modifications to existing regulations within this section.
Requests for use of alternative landscaping schemes are justified only when one
or more of the following conditions apply:
         a.   The sites involve space limitations or unusually shaped parcels;
         b.   Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such
that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
         c.   Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer
yard is larger than can be provided; and
         d.   Safety considerations are involved.
      2.   Request For Alternative Method Of Compliance: The applicant must
provide the city with a written request if an alternative method of compliance
is proposed. The request shall state which requirement as set forth within this
section is to be modified, what project conditions stated within subsection O1
of this section justify using the proposed alternative, and how the proposed
alternative equals or exceeds said requirement.
      3.   Tree Fund: Persons applying for an alternative method of compliance
for relief from regulations that require all existing trees to remain on site
may elect to make a financial contribution to the Eagle city tree fund in lieu
of retaining all trees on site. The condition(s) which warrants the need for
the tree fund alternate method of compliance shall be specified in the
application submitted under subsection O2 of this section. If the application
is approved, the amount to be contributed by the applicant will be based upon
the total caliper inches of deciduous tree(s) removed from the site and the
total vertical feet of coniferous trees removed from the site. Cost per caliper
inch for deciduous trees and cost per vertical foot for coniferous trees shall
be determined by resolution of the city council. The applicant shall have the
right to review and consider the value determination, and following said
review, to reapply for other alternative methods of compliance, without
prejudice, in accordance with subsection O2 of this section.
   P.   Plan Preparation: Preparing a landscape plan requires special skills.
Landscaping involves more than a simple arrangement of plants with irrigation;
plants are not haphazardly placed in a way that fills up leftover space.
Landscape plans should reflect a theme so that site elements are artfully and
technically organized in a way that conveys meaning, coherence, and spatial
organization. Landscaping should enhance the physical environment as well as
the project's aesthetic character. Therefore, landscape plans to be submitted
for approval shall be prepared by or under the responsible control of a
licensed landscape architect with said plans to be duly stamped to clearly
identify the preparer.
   Q.   Approved Tree List: This list is a suggested planting list. Other tree
species and varieties will be considered.

as established by the zoning ordinance except those signs specifically
enumerated in this article.

for any sign not specifically defined herein, the zoning administrator shall
use the definition or classification within this article which most closely
defines or classifies any such sign.
      3.   Architectural Compatibility: The number, area, and height of signs
as outlined in this article are intended to be maximum standards which do not
necessarily ensure architectural compatibility. Therefore, in addition to the
enumerated maximum standards, the city shall give consideration to a sign's
relationship to the overall appearance of the subject property as well as the
surrounding area.
      4.   Materials And Appearance: It is the intent of this article to
encourage interesting, creative, readable, effective, uncluttered, and well
maintained signage. Sign materials and appearance shall be complementary to the
building architecture and colors. The exhibits provided in the EASD book are
examples of the types of sign designs envisioned for the Eagle architecture
theme.
      5.   Nonconforming Signs: All signs in the entire city on the effective
date hereof shall conform to this title upon any structural change to the sign,

associated with the business is changed, except as provided for within
subsection C16n, "Historic Signage", of this section.
      6.   Change Of Face, Copy And/Or Logo On Signs: For signs conforming to

way and provided that the colors previously approved by the city are not
changed.
   B.   Definitions: If conflict arises between any definition in this section

phrases not specifically defined shall be interpreted to give this article its
most reasonable application.

   S.   Personal Wireless Facilities, Spires, Poles, Antennas, Steeples,
Towers, And Other Such Structures:
      1.   Purpose:
         a.   To accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the council finds that regulations regarding personal wireless
facilities, spires, poles, antennas, steeples, towers, and other such
structures are necessary in order to:
            (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication
services to the residents and businesses of the city;
            (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of spires, poles, antennas,
steeples, towers, and other such structures through careful design and sitting
standards;
            (3)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from spire,
pole, antenna, steeple, tower, and other such structures' failure, through
structural standards and setback requirements; and
            (4)   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and
buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to
reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community, like church
steeples, windmills, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, light standards,
flagpoles, or trees.
      2.   Towers And Personal Wireless Facilities In Zoning Districts:
         a.   Central Business District: Personal wireless facilities shall be
camouflaged or concealed, not readily identifiable as such, designed to be
aesthetically compatible with existing and proposed uses on the site in the
central business district.
         b.   Mixed Use District: Personal wireless facilities shall be
camouflaged or concealed, not readily identifiable as such, designed to be
aesthetically compatible with existing and proposed uses on the site in the
mixed use district.
         c.   Residential (R) Districts:
            (1)   On residentially zoned parcels, towers supporting amateur
radio antennas shall not be permitted in the front, side or street side yard.
            (2)   Personal wireless facilities shall be camouflaged or
concealed, not readily identifiable as such, designed to be aesthetically
compatible with existing and proposed uses on the site in all residential (R)
districts.
         d.   PS (Public/Semipublic) District:
            (1)   Personal wireless facilities may be permitted to be attached
to existing light standards and power line support devices (or replacement
equivalent of same height) provided, however, the antenna(s) are either flush
mounted or mounted in a manner that provides minimum visual impact.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all provisions of this subsection S shall be
applicable to wireless antennas located on existing light standards and power
line support devices.
            (2)   Personal wireless facilities shall be camouflaged or
concealed, not readily identifiable as such, designed to be aesthetically
compatible with existing and proposed uses on the site in the public/semipublic
district unless installed in accordance with subsection S2d(1) of this section.
      3.   Collocation Requirements:
         a.   A proposal for a new tower mounted personal wireless facility in
excess of thirty five feet (35') in height shall not be approved unless the
city council finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the
proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or
building within the following radii of the proposed tower:
            (1)   A two (2) mile radius for towers with a height over one
hundred ten feet (110').
            (2)   A one mile radius for towers with a height over eighty feet
(80') but not more than one hundred ten feet (110').
            (3)   A one-half (1/2) mile radius for towers with a height over
fifty feet (50') but not more than eighty feet (80').
            (4)   A one-fourth (1/4) mile radius for towers with a height over
thirty five feet (35') but not more than fifty feet (50').
         b.   It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that the
proposed tower or antenna cannot be accommodated on an approved tower or
building within the required search radius due to one or more of the following
reasons:
            (1)   Unwillingness of another tower or facility owner to entertain
shared use.
            (2)   The proposed collocation of an existing tower or facility
would be in violation of any local, state or federal law.
            (3)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
            (4)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
            (5)   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional
engineer.
            (6)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate
the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, or
other professional qualified to provide necessary documentation.
         c.   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower
shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least
two (2) additional users if the tower is over one hundred ten feet (110') in
height, for at least one additional user if the tower is over fifty feet (50')
in height.
         d.   Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of
antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
         e.   Personal wireless facilities proposed at a location which has an
approved conditional use permit (approved after the effective date hereof) for
an existing facility which was required to allow collocation shall not be
required to obtain a separate conditional use permit as long as all the
requirements of the previously approved conditional use permit will be complied
with. Design review, and subsequent building permit, will be required for any
such proposal.
      4.   Tower And Antenna Design Requirements:
         a.   All personal wireless facilities shall be required to obtain
design review approval prior to construction.
         b.   Personal wireless facility towers shall be of a monopole design

and connection lines approved by the issuing authority, no part of any antenna
or tower nor any lines, cable, equipment or wires or braces in connection with
either shall at any time extend across or over any part of the right of way,
public street, highway, sidewalk, or property line.
         d.   Every tower affixed to the ground shall be protected to
discourage climbing of the tower by unauthorized persons. The climbing pegs
within the bottom twenty feet (20') of the tower shall be removed and shall
only be used when the tower is being serviced.
         e.   Metal towers shall be constructed of, or treated with, corrosive
resistant material.
         f.   Wood poles shall be impregnated with rot resistant substances.

         a.   Towers shall meet the setbacks of the underlying zoning district
with the exception of industrial zoning districts, where towers may encroach
into the rear setback area, provided that the rear property line abuts another
industrially zoned property and the tower does not encroach upon any easements.
         b.   The base of the personal wireless facility shall be set back a
minimum distance of two (2) times the height of the tower from the property
line of any residential dwelling.
         c.   If the tower does not exceed the height limitations of the zone
in which it is located, the tower shall meet the setback requirement of the
zone except as allowed in subsection S5a of this section. If the tower exceeds
the height limit of the zone in which it is located, the tower shall be set
back one foot (1') for every ten feet (10') in total tower height. In either
case, the tower shall be constructed to the telecommunications industry
association/electronic industries association (TIA/EIA) 222 revision F standard
entitled "Structural Standards For Steel Antenna Supporting Structures" or as
hereinafter may be amended. Otherwise, the tower shall be located a minimum of
one foot (1') for each foot of height from all property lines (the fall zone).
No storage or structures other than the accessory utility buildings, are
permitted in the fall zone, except as may be specifically permitted by the city
council through a conditional use process.
         d.   Towers shall be set back from all existing public right of way
lines (or planned right of way lines if additional is to be acquired in the
future) by a minimum distance equal to twice the height of the tower including
all antennas and attachments.
         e.   Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a
public street.
         f.   A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a
public street varied, at the sole discretion of the city council, to allow the
integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church
steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure.
         g.   If any tower setback requirement conflicts with other setback
requirements of this code the setback with the greater distance shall prevail,
except as may be allowed in subsection S5f of this section.
      6.   Tower Lighting, Signage, And Attachments:
         a.   No antenna or tower shall have affixed or attached to it in any
way, except during time of repair or installation, any stationary lights,
strobe lights, reflectors, flashers, or other illuminating device, except as
specifically required by the federal aviation administration, federal
communications commission, or other federal or state authority.
         b.   When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light
fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be
attached to the tower if approved by the city.
         c.   The use of any portion of a tower for signs, other than warning
or equipment information signs, is prohibited.

         a.   In accordance with the federal communications commission's
preemptive ruling PRB 1, towers erected for the primary purpose of supporting
amateur radio antennas may exceed thirty feet (30') in height provided that a
determination is made by the city that the proposed tower height is technically
necessary to successfully engage in amateur radio communications. A conditional
use permit is required for any amateur radio antenna in excess of thirty five
feet (35').
      8.   Accessory Utility Buildings:
         a.   All utility buildings and structures accessory to a tower are
required to have design review approved by the city prior to construction.

8-4-1: INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS:
In the interpretation of this chapter, the following shall govern:
   A.   Parking spaces for other permitted or conditional uses not listed
herein shall be determined by the administrator. Among the factors for
determining the number of spaces to be required for a use not listed herein,
the administrator shall compare the proposed use with a use which has similar
traffic generating characteristics as outlined in the most recent version of
the Institute Of Transportation Engineers' "Trip Generation Manual".
   B.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
   C.   All development located within the design review overlay district shall
comply in all respects with the site and building lighting requirements
established herein. (Ord. 756, 8-23-2016)
8-4-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   No building or structure shall be erected, substantially altered, or
its use changed unless permanently maintained off street parking and loading
spaces have been provided in accordance with the provisions of this title.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter, except where there is a change of use,
shall not apply to any existing building or structure. Where a new use involves
no additions or enlargements, there shall be provided as many such spaces as
may be required by this title.
   C.   Whenever a building, structure, or use, constructed or changed in use
after the effective date hereof, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number
of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise to
create a need for an increase in the number of existing parking spaces per this
title, additional parking spaces shall be provided so that the existing
building, structure, or use, and proposed enlargement or change in use, shall
then and thereafter comply with the full parking requirements set forth herein.
   D.   If more than one use is located on the site, the number of off street
parking spaces shall be equal to the sum of the requirements prescribed for
each use unless a joint/collective parking facility is approved as provided for
in section
8-4-4-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 309, 1-27-1998)
8-4-3: DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Paving: The required number of parking and loading spaces as set forth
in this chapter, together with driveways, aisles and other circulation areas,
shall be improved with material such as asphalt or concrete, to provide a
durable and dust free surface. Gravel or dirt surfaces shall not be permitted
unless used as part of a home occupation.
   B.   Drainage: All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper
drainage of surface water to prevent the drainage of such water onto adjacent
properties or walkways. Drainage plans shall be reviewed and approved by the
city engineer and, for any site abutting a public street, such plans shall be
reviewed and approved by the Ada County highway district, or highway district
having jurisdiction.
   C.   Access: Access driveways for parking areas or loading spaces shall be
located in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such area shall be
clearly visible by a pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or driveway
from a public or private street.
   D.   Maintenance: The owner of property used for parking and/or loading
shall maintain such area in good condition without holes and free of all dust,
trash and other debris.
   E.   Compact Spaces: A maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the total spaces
provided may be designed, designated and used for compact size vehicles. The
minimum standards for compact vehicle spaces and driveways are set forth in
subsection
8-4-4-2F of this chapter. Compact spaces shall be located along the perimeter
of the parking lot or in those areas most distant from the structure or use
being served. Parking areas immediately adjacent to or within close proximity
to the building entrances shall be designated for standard (full size) spaces.
Compact spaces shall be clearly marked as such on the pavement or curb. Surplus
parking spaces (those spaces that exceed the minimum number required by this
title) shall also comply with the thirty percent (30%) maximum per total number
of spaces permitted for compact spaces. The allowed percentage of compact
spaces may only be increased by conditional use approval from the city council.
(Ord. 309, 1-27-1998; amd. Ord. 827, 10-22-2020)

acceptably designed wall, fence, or planting screen. Such wall, fence, or
planting screen shall not be less than four feet (4') nor more than six feet
(6') in height and shall be maintained in good condition. The space between
such fence, wall or planting screen and the lot line of the adjoining premises
in any residential district shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or
evergreen ground cover, and maintained in good condition. In the event that
terrain or other natural features are such that the erection of such wall,
fence, or planting screen will not serve the intended purpose, then no such
wall, fence, or planting screen and landscaping shall be required.
   E.   Wheel Blocks: Whenever a parking lot extends to a property line, wheel

8-5-2: Authority To Continue Nonconforming Use
8-5-3: Extension Or Enlargement Of Nonconforming Use
8-5-4: Repairs And Maintenance
8-5-5: Nonconforming Lots Of Record
8-5-6: Buildings Under Construction
8-5-1: INTENT:
It is the intent of this chapter to permit nonconforming uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-5-2: AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING USE:
If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date hereof that would not be allowed in
the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Additions Or Alterations: Unless permitted in accordance with section
8-5-2C of this title, no existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by
this title in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when a residential dwelling is
destroyed due to catastrophic fire or other natural disaster it may be rebuilt,
subject to reasonable regulation by the city, upon the structure's original
footprint. A permit for reconstruction shall be obtained within six (6) months
of the fire or natural disaster event.
   B.   Expansion: No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any
additional land area.
   C.   Change Of Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming use of a structure and
land may, upon the issuance of a conditional use permit by the council, be
changed to another nonconforming use; provided, that the council shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the
council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with other
provisions of this title. Upon the change of a nonconforming use to another
nonconforming use through the issuance of a conditional use permit, the terms
and provisions of the conditional use permit shall prevail and the previous
nonconforming use rights shall no longer exist. If any term or condition of the
conditional use permit is violated, the conditional use permit may be revoked,
at which time the use will be considered an illegal use. Thereafter, the use
and zoning shall conform to those permitted or conditional uses allowed under
the zoning code in effect at that time.
   D.   Change To Conforming Use: Any structure, or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted
use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   E.   Discontinuance Of Nonconforming Use: When a nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned
for more than one year (except when government action impedes access to the
premises), the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   F.   Elimination Of Nonconforming Structure: Where nonconforming use status
applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the
structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land, except as
otherwise may be permitted in this section.
(Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980; amd. Ord. 756, 8-23-2016; Ord. 820, 12-10-2019)
8-5-3: EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING USE:
Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming use shall
not be extended or enlarged after the effective date hereof by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally
prohibited in the district in which such use is located. (Ord. 40, 10-1978,
rev. 9-1980)
8-5-4: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided, that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-5-5: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   Single Nonconforming Lots Of Record: In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record (see definition
of "lot of record" in section
8-1-2 of this title) at the effective date hereof, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this title. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership
(see subsection B of this section). This provision shall apply even though such
lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided, that hard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
   B.   Nonconforming Lots Of Record In Combination: If two (2) or more lots or
a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the effective date hereof, and if all or part of the
lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this title and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold
in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this title, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this title.
(Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-5-6: BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION:
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date hereof and
upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. (Ord.
40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)

8-6-1: PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish clear development
standards that will achieve the city of Eagle's vision for development as
presented in the Eagle comprehensive plan. The standards will be designed to
create livable communities that provide exemplary open spaces and recreational
opportunities, that encourage a diversification of housing types, styles and
living options for a wide range of income levels and lifestyles, and thereby
enhance the living experience within the city of Eagle.
   B.   Goals: To provide guidance and establish expectations for development
within the city of Eagle. The PUD provides clear standards and options for
development within the city including lot sizing, open space and the
diversification of housing types.
   C.   Objective: To guide land development and construction through the
planned unit development (PUD) to achieve the following:
      1.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types, lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area
requirements;
      2.   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses, office uses and services;
      3.   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation,
and prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
      4.   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets; and
      5.   A development pattern in harmony with the objective for land use
density, transportation and community facilities as presented in the
comprehensive plan. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-2: EFFECT OF OTHER ZONING PROVISIONS:
   A.   Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of
this chapter and those of the other chapters of this title, the provisions of
this chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this title.
   B.   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, planned unit
developments shall also be subject to the requirements set forth in chapter 2,
article A, "Design Review Overlay District", of this title; title 10, chapter
1, "Flood Control Regulations", of this code; and title 9, "Land Subdivisions",
of this code. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-3: OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS:
An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property owner or a
person having an existing interest in the property to be included in the PUD.
The PUD application shall be filed in the name or names of the recorded owner
or owners of property included in the development. However, the application may
be filed by the holder(s) of an equitable interest in such property.
Before approval is granted to the final development plan, the entire project
shall be under single ownership or control. Documentation showing single
ownership or control shall be presented with the final development plan
application. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-4: USES PERMITTED:
All uses that may be allowed within the land use district are permitted within
a PUD. Also, up to ten percent (10%) of the gross land area may be directed to
other commercial, office, public and quasi-public uses that are not allowed
within the land use district; provided, that there is a favorable finding by
the council:
   A.   That the uses are appropriate with the residential uses;
   B.   That the uses are intended to serve principally the residents of the
PUD;
   C.   That the uses are planned as an integral part of the PUD;
   D.   That the uses be located and so designed as to provide direct access to
a collector or an arterial street without creating congestion or traffic
hazards; and
   E.   That a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the residential development
occurs prior to the development of the related commercial or office land uses.
(Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-5: SITE AND STRUCTURE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS:
8-6-5-1: MINIMUM AREA:
A PUD for the following principal uses shall contain an area of not less than
the following, however, the zoning administrator may permit the submittal of a
PUD which does not meet the minimum area requirements provided the council
finds that unique or special circumstances exist with regard to the site so as
to warrant the exception and that the PUD will be designed and operated in
accordance with the provisions of this title:
   A.   Three (3) acres for residential development.
   B.   Five (5) acres for residential use with subordinate commercial or
office uses.
   C.   Ten (10) acres for commercial and office use.
   D.   Ten (10) acres for commercial and office use with subordinate
residential uses. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-5-2: COMMON AREA OPEN SPACE:
   A.   Required Common Area Open Space: A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of
the gross land area developed in any residential PUD project shall be reserved
for common area open space and recreational facilities for the residents or
users of the area being developed.
   B.   Active Open Space: A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the common
area open space shall be developed as active open space, as defined in title 9
of this code.
   C.   Compliance: All common area open space shall be evaluated for its
compliance with the following:
      1.   Landscaping: Streetscape, open spaces and plazas, use of existing
landscaping, pedestrianway treatment and recreational areas;
      2.   Siting: Visual focal points, use of existing physical features such
as topography, view, sun and wind orientation, circulation pattern, physical
environment.
   D.   Direct Access: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of all lots shall be
designed to be adjacent to, or at a minimum, have direct access to common area
open space. The term "direct access" means all building lots are to be located
a maximum of two hundred fifty feet (250') away from a pathway connecting to a
common area open space lot. Building lots separated from a common area open
space lot by a local roadway shall be deemed to have achieved direct access.
The required planter strip located between the sidewalk and the street will not
be permitted to fulfill this requirement.
   E.   Dedication Of Land For Public Use: A required amount of common open
space land reserved under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by
owners of the project area for the use of each owner who buys property within
the development or be dedicated to the public and retained as common open space
for parks, recreation and related uses. Public utility and similar easements
and right of way for watercourses and other similar channels are not acceptable
for common open space dedication unless such land or right of way is usable as
a trail or other similar purpose and approved by the council.
   F.   Maintenance: The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces
shall be specified by the developer before approval of the final development
plan. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-5-3: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are required
within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances to these systems which can be
effectively screened may be exempted from this requirement if the council finds
that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the proposed
PUD. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-5-4: HOUSING FOR OLDER PERSONS:
   A.   To provide an incentive for communities for "older persons" (55 and
over - as defined by the federal fair housing act of 1999, or any subsequent
revision thereof) to be included within lower density residential PUDs the
council may authorize an increased residential density to allow a maximum of
three (3) dwelling units per gross acre within any zoning designation which
limits density to less than three (3) dwelling units per gross acre
specifically and solely for any portion of a PUD planned for a community for
"older persons". Such a density increase shall not be permitted in an A or A-
R zoning designation.
Character, identity, landscaping and architectural/siting variation are to be
incorporated into any community for "older persons". The community may consist
of single-family, two-family or multi-family dwelling units, or a mixture
thereof, and should be clustered and include amenities for "older persons".
Zero lot line development with common open space areas shall be the only type
of development permitted to be considered for such an increase. The zero lot
line development shall allow for minimal front and/or rear yard areas for each
residential unit if proposed by the developer and approved by the city.
However, the exterior side walls of all residential buildings shall abut a
common area lot line. The intent of the zero lot line development is to allow
for large areas of open space as opposed to a sea of side yard and rear yard
fences dividing residential lots. For purposes of this section, the minimum lot
size referenced elsewhere within this code shall be calculated by considering
the entire community for "older persons" as a whole. Also, the PUD shall be
designed so the community for "older persons" portion of the development does
not abut residential parcels adjacent to the PUD and sufficient buffering be
provided as may be required by the city. Stand alone communities consisting of
only housing for "older persons", as defined, may be allowed to request a gated
community with private roads.
The following site criteria must be met in order to consider approval of the
density increase for the community for "older persons":
      1.   For a planned unit development containing multiple housing types,
the land area containing housing exclusively for "older persons" shall not
encompass a land area exceeding sixteen percent (16%) of the total land area
within the entire planned unit development;
      2.   The total land area of the entire planned unit development shall be
a minimum of eighty (80) acres. The total land area of a stand alone planned
unit development consisting of only "older persons" housing shall be a maximum
of thirty (30) acres;
      3.   The entire PUD shall be served by either a municipal or community
water and sewer system;
      4.   Any limitations regarding individuals occupying the community for
"older persons" must be in accordance with local, state and federal
regulations, and must specifically be in accordance with the federal fair
housing act as revised in 1999, or any subsequent revision thereof. "Older
persons" shall be as defined within the aforementioned act;
      5.   The community for "older persons" shall be prohibited within any
100-year floodplain;
      6.   Open space requirements shall be as follows (where this section and
any other section of this title or title 9 of this code conflict or overlap,
this section shall control):
         a.   If the residential lots (not including the community for "older
persons" portion of the PUD) meet the minimum lot size requirement or are
reduced below the minimum lot size requirements such that no residential lot is
less than one acre in size, the entire PUD shall consist of a minimum of twenty
percent (20%) of open space.
         b.   If the residential lots (not including the community for "older
persons" portion of the PUD) are reduced below the minimum lot size requirement
such that any residential lot is less than one acre in size, the entire PUD
shall consist of a minimum of twenty six percent (26%) of open space.
         c.   Pathways, buffer areas, public park sites, public school sites,
and public golf courses and/or driving ranges proposed within any such PUD
shall be included, in their entirety, with any other open space areas proposed
when calculating the minimum open space required.
         d.   A minimum of one 5,000-square foot clubhouse/indoor recreation
facility shall be provided with the community for "older persons" portion of
the PUD.
      7.   The final plat shall include a note indicating that the portion of
land permitted for the density bonus for "older persons" shall be for "older
persons" as defined by the federal fair housing act as revised in 1999, or any
subsequent revision thereof.
      8.   Enforcement of the provisions of the federal fair housing act of
1999, or any subsequent revision thereof, must be the responsibility of the
homeowners' association and so noted in the CC&Rs. (Ord. 717, 4-8-2014)
8-6-5-5: ARRANGEMENT OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS:
To encourage land use plans to be submitted as a planned unit development (PUD)
so as to provide an enhanced integration of open space and a variety of housing
options, the following design criteria shall be considered by the city:
   A.   All lots within the PUD shall comply with the minimum lot size in the
underlying zone as established in section
8-2-4 of this title, except that a decrease in the minimum lot size may be
allowed if there is an "offsetting increase" of the same square footage in open
space and a favorable finding is made by the council that the smaller lots are
appropriately integrated into the overall design and that the building product
type is compatible with the PUD and surrounding area.
As an incentive to submit a PUD versus a standard subdivision, the initial
starting point for minimum open space, prior to any "offsetting increase" being
added, shall be the area that is equal to ten percent (10%) of the site. This
allowance shall only be permitted under the following criteria:
      1.   The total common area open space shall be equal to or greater than
twenty percent (20%), inclusive of the "offsetting increase" square footage.
      2.   A favorable finding by the council must be obtained assuring that
character, identity and architectural and siting variation are incorporated
into the development and that these factors make up a substantial contribution
to the objectives of the PUD. These design elements are as follows:
         a.   Landscaping, streetscape, open spaces and plazas, use of existing
landscaping, pedestrianway treatment and recreational areas;
         b.   Siting, visual focal points, use of existing physical features
such as topography, view, sun and wind orientation, circulation pattern,
physical environment, variation in building setbacks and building grouping
(such as clustering); and
         c.   Design features, street sections, architectural styles,
harmonious use of materials, parking areas broken by landscaping features and
varied use of housing types.
      3.   Setbacks for modified lots sizes shall conform with the closest
compatible base zone under section
8-2-4 of this title.
   B.   An area equal to the square footage utilized to create lots that are
larger than the minimum lot size may be credited toward the creation of lots
which are proportionally smaller than the minimum lot size in the underlying
zone established in section
8-2-4 of this title, provided:
      1.   There is a favorable finding by the council that the smaller lots
are appropriately integrated into the overall design and that the building
product type is compatible with the PUD and surrounding area.
      2.   The number of lots below the minimum lot size do not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the total number of lots within the development.
   C.   PUDs located within one-fourth (1/4) mile of an arterial roadway, as
identified on the transportation and pathway network plan in the Eagle
comprehensive plan, may be permitted to design and construct up to fifteen
percent (15%) of the units within the development as multi-family/attached
units with the following specifications:
      1.   A favorable finding is made by the council that the attached units
are appropriately integrated into the overall design and that the building
product type is compatible with the PUD and surrounding area.
      2.   A maximum of six (6) units can be attached in a single housing
group.
      3.   All attached units shall be located adjacent to common area open
space.
      4.   Attached units shall be located within the portion of the
development site that is in closest proximity to the arterial.
      5.   Design review approval is required for all attached units.
      6.   Height, area, and setback regulations for attached units shall be as
follows:
 
              Minimum Yard Setbacks                            
               Note Conditions A to E*
                                      Interior Side  Minimum    Minimum Lot
Maximum Height Front Rear Street Side (Outside Wall) Building   Area
                                                     Separation
35'            20'   25'  20'         10'            20'        2,000 square
                                                                feet per unit
 
* Note Conditions:
   A.   Additional 5 feet per story side setback for multi-story structures is
required.
   B.   The street side setback may be reduced to 0 feet for buildings which
are separated from the street by a minimum 25 foot wide common area open space
lot.
   C.   The rear setback may be reduced to 12.5 feet for buildings on lots
which are separated from other lots by a minimum 25 foot wide common area open
space lot.
   D.   The rear setback may be reduced to 0 feet for buildings on lots which
are separated from other lots by a minimum 50 foot wide common area open space
lot.
   E.   The rear setback may be reduced to 12.5 feet for buildings with rear
load (alley) garages.
 
(Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-5-6: ARRANGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE USES:
When PUDs include commercial or office uses, buildings and establishments shall
be planned as groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress
points in order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at
intersections. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of
the commercial areas abutting residential areas.
The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design
of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal
traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may
be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas.
All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-6: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
When the PUD also qualifies as a subdivision, the processing of the conditional
use permit and subdivision application 1  shall occur at the same time. The
granting of a conditional use permit for a PUD shall require a preapplication,
the submission of a preliminary development plan and approval by the council of
a final development plan as specified within this title. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
 
Notes
1 1. See title 9 of this code.
8-6-6-1: PREAPPLICATION MEETING:
The developer shall meet with the administrator prior to the submission of the
preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early
and informally the purpose and effect of this chapter and the criteria and
standards herein, and to familiarize the developer with the comprehensive plan,
zoning title, subdivision title 1  and such other plans and ordinances as
deemed appropriate. The developer may also meet with the commission or council
prior to submitting an application. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
 
Notes
1 2. See title 9 of this code.
8-6-6-2: PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   A.   Application For Preliminary PUD: An application for preliminary PUD
shall be filed with the administrator by a property owner or person having
existing interest in the property for which the PUD is proposed. At a minimum,
the application shall contain the following information filed in triplicate:

be in the public interest.
   B.   Public Notice: The same provision for public hearing and legal
notification as required for conditional use permits, section
8-7-8 of this title, shall be followed.
   C.   Approval In Principle Of Preliminary Development Plan:
      1.   The commission shall review the preliminary development plan to
determine if it is consistent with the intent and purpose of this title;
whether the proposed development advances the general welfare of the community
and neighborhood and whether the benefits, combination of various land uses and
the interrelationship with the land uses in the surrounding area justify the
deviation from standard district regulations and its recommendation to the
council. The commission's recommendation in principle of the preliminary
development plan shall be necessary before an applicant may submit a final
development plan. Approval in principle shall not be construed to endorse a
precise location of uses, configuration of parcels or engineering feasibility.
      2.   The council shall consider all provisions of this chapter including
the general standards applicable to conditional use permits and criteria for
conditional uses before approving in principle a preliminary development plan.
The council may, upon the finding that unique or special circumstances exist
with regard to the preliminary development plan, consider specific deviations
from the requirements of this chapter provided conditions are placed on the PUD
to assure that it will be designed and operated in accordance with goals and
objectives of this chapter. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
8-6-6-3: FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   A.   Application For Approval: Upon approval in principle of a preliminary
development plan, an application for approval of the final development plan
shall be filed with the administrator by at least one property owner or person
having a presently existing interest in the property for which the PUD is
proposed. Each application shall be signed by the owner or applicant, attesting
to the truth and exactness of all information supplied on the application for
final development plan. At a minimum, the applicant shall provide the following

supplementary conditions or disapprove the application as presented. Upon
granting or denying the application, the council shall specify:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
      2.   The facts submitted with the application and presented to them
establish that:
         a.   The proposed development can be initiated within one year of the
date of approval;
         b.   Each individual phase of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent phase capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained and the uses proposed
will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will
have a beneficial effect which would not be achieved under standard district
regulations;
         c.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate
to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic
in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PUD;
         d.   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed;
         e.   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan, in
accordance with the PUD and the adopted policy of the council;
         f.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
         g.   The PUD is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan;
and
         h.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed;
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
If the application is either approved or approved with conditions, the council
shall direct the administrator to issue zoning permits only in accordance with
the approved final development plan and the supplementary conditions attached
thereto. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
   C.   Expiration And Extension Of Approval Period: The approval of a final
development plan for a PUD shall be for a period not to exceed one year to
allow for preparation and recording of the required subdivision plat and the
development of the project. If no construction has begun within one year after
approval is granted, the approved final development plan shall be void, unless
an extension of time is approved as provided herein.
      1.   A maximum twelve (12) month extension of the time limit of an
approved final development plan may be granted by the city council, at its sole
discretion, if the following findings are made:
         a.   No outstanding city code violations exist on the subject
property. If such violations exist, they may be conditioned by the city council
to be cured as a condition of the extension of time;
         b.   The final development plan, as previously approved, remains in
the best interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the city;
         c.   There have been no significant changes to this code between the
date of final development plan approval and the application date of the time
extension request that would require substantial modifications to the project;
         d.   There are no hazardous situations which have developed or have
been discovered on the project site;
         e.   The public facilities and services required for the project
remain adequate;
         f.   The applicant has provided a viable and acceptable plan which
demonstrates how the completion of the final development plan will commence
within the year; and
         g.   The applicant has provided a schedule that depicts the
anticipated progress for completion of the final development plan within the
year.
      2.   The city council reserves the right to revoke the extension of time
approval if it finds that any of the criteria herein are not met.
      3.   This section does not limit the number of extensions the city
council may grant to an applicant so long as the criteria set forth in
subsection C1 of this section are met. Nothing in this section requires the
city council to grant any extension of an approval period. (Ord. 647, 11-23-
2010)
8-6-7: NATURAL FEATURES ANALYSIS:
   A.   Planned Unit Development (PUD) applications shall require a natural
features analysis (NFA) and natural features map(s) to be submitted with the
preliminary development plan as specified below:
      1.   The NFA shall outline the resources present on or within the
boundaries of the site, as well as the associated effects (direct and indirect)
of the proposed development on or to those resources. In addition to the
resources listed below, impacts to open space, wildlife habitat, and
agriculture (if applicable) shall be addressed.
      2.   The NFA shall be completed by a resource specialist, i.e. someone
showing sufficient education, experience, and/or credentials in the specific
resources outlined below. The minimum experience for the author of the NFA
shall be one of the following: a BS/BA from an accredited college or university
in a related field of study plus at least ten (10) years direct field
experience, a MS/MA from an accredited college or university in a related field
of study plus at least five (5) years direct field experience, or a Certified
Environmental Professional as defined by the American Society for Testing and
Materials or the National Association of Environmental Professionals. If the
resource specialist is a Certified Environmental Professional, they must also
provide evidence supporting their qualifications (academic or professional
experience) related to the resources identified below.
      3.   The NFA shall include a mitigation plan that adequately addresses
the impacts to the resources affected. As the associated impacts to the
resources are permanent in nature, the proposed mitigation action shall also be
in effect in perpetuity. The mitigation plan shall include adaptive management
principles (monitoring and alternative actions if unsuccessful), a funding
source and funds manger (if required), and justification that the plan would
effectively mitigate the impacts.
      4.   The NFA shall also include the following:
         a.   Hydrology: Analysis and map of natural drainage patterns and
water resources including an analysis of streams, natural drainage swales,
ponds or lakes, wetlands, floodplain areas or other areas subject to flooding,
poorly drained areas, permanent high ground water areas, and seasonal high
ground water areas throughout the site.
         b.   Soils: Analysis and map of types of soils present in the site
area including delineation of prime agricultural soil areas, aquifer recharge
soil areas, unstable soils most susceptible to erosion, and soils suitable for
development. The analysis of soils shall be based on the Ada County soils
survey (United States department of agriculture, natural resources conservation
service).
         c.   Topography: Analysis and map of the site's terrain including
topographic mapping of elevations with details sufficient to determine property
topography and any slopes. If a drainage channel borders the proposed
development, the contour lines shall extend the additional distance necessary
to include the entire drainage facility abutting the site. Additionally, if
determined by the administrator, for adequate analysis of impacts, contour
lines a distance determined by the administrator shall extend beyond the
proposed development boundary.
         d.   Vegetation: Analysis and map of existing vegetation of the site
including, but not limited to, existing trees, plants, and ground cover
species.
         e.   Wildlife: Analysis and map of existing or potential wildlife
species.
         f.   Sensitive Plant And Wildlife Species: Analysis and map of
sensitive plant and wildlife species of the site including, but not limited to,
those species listed in the Idaho conservation data center (state of Idaho
department of fish and game).
         g.   Historic Resources: Analysis and map of existing historic
resources as identified on the Ada County historic resources inventory and/or
the State of Idaho Historic Preservation Office.
         h.   Hazardous Areas: Analysis and map of all potentially hazardous
areas including, but not limited to, land that is unsuitable for development
because of flood threat, poorly drained areas, high ground water, steep slopes,
rock formation, buried pipelines, or other similar conditions likely to be
encountered.
         i.   Agriculture: Analysis and map of existing agricultural resources
including farming and ranching.
         j.   Map Features: The map shall show important features, including,
but not limited to, the following: outline of existing resources (see above)
and structures, watercourses, wetlands, power lines, telephone lines, railroad
lines, airport influence areas, any existing easements, municipal boundaries,
and section lines.
         k.   Other Supplemental Data: Other supplemental data may be required
by the city including, but not limited to, the following:
            (1)   Approximate location of any areas of fill.
            (2)   The elevations of all corner points on the boundaries of the
proposed plat.
            (3)   The presence of any significant natural or cultural
resources, i.e. wetlands or riparian areas, state or federally listed species
of concern (plants, insects, and wildlife), culturally significant sites for
Tribes, sites identified on the national register, or others.
   B.   Mitigation Plan: A mitigation plan is intended to off-set the spatial
and temporal impacts (direct and indirect) to existing resources (see above) of
a site from a proposed action. Mitigation actions should be similar in scope
(size or intensity), timeframe (permanent impacts addressed in perpetuity), and
location (within in ten (10) miles of the Eagle City limits). This can be
accomplished a number of ways, including but not limited to (examples only):
      1.   Permanently protecting an equivalent amount of land being impacted:
this can be accomplished with local land banks, development of off-site
conservation easements, or other similar approaches using existing lands that
could otherwise be developed in the future;
      2.   Increased habitat or use value of residual lands: increasing the
value of the residual lands within a specified project area to offset the loss
of open space, wildlife habitat, or ag lands. For example, if one hundred (100)
acres were being developed, the developer could set aside twenty-five (25)
acres (seventy- five (75) acres developed) and increase the value of the
residual habitat through enhancement measures so that the residual lands would
provide the same level of habitat value as the 100 acres;
      3.   A combination of the two actions above coupled with a community
education plan;
      4.   Conservation and Education Program (CEP): payment on a per lot basis
to the City's Conservation and Education Program with fees established by
resolution of the city council;
      5.   Or any other proposed mitigation that adequately mitigates impacts
to resources as determined by the city council. (Ord. 868, 8-8-2022)
8-6-8: TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS:
Planned Unit Development (PUD) applications shall require an analysis of
impacts to the regional transportation system resulting from the proposed land
uses and population prepared in coordination with, as applicable, the Idaho
Transportation Department, Ada County Highway District, Community Planning
Association Of Southwest Idaho, Valley Regional Transit, and any other local
jurisdiction(s) having authority over the public highways and streets
materially affected by the planned community. The traffic impact study shall be
submitted to ITD and ACHD thirty (30) days prior to submission of the PUD
application to the city. (Ord. 868, 8-8-2022)

8-7-3: CONDITIONAL USES:
8-7-3-1: PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION OF CONDITIONAL USE:
   A.   Purpose: It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of
uses are appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more
conventional uses possess characteristics of such unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, method of operation, circulation and public
facilities that each specific use must be considered individually.
   B.   Interpretation Of Conditional Use: Any use which is permitted as a
conditional use in a district under the terms of this title shall not be deemed
a nonconforming use in such district, but shall, without further action, be
considered a conforming one.
   C.   Exceptions or waivers of standards within Title 8 or Title 9, other
than use, inclusive of the subject matter addressed by Section
8-7-4-2 or Section
9-6-3 “Variances” may be permitted through issuance of a conditional use
permit. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980; amd. Ord. 858, 10-26-2021)
8-7-3-2: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES:
The commission/council shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each proposed conditional use in terms of the following standards and shall
find adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   A.   Will, in fact, constitute a conditional use as established in section
8-2-3 of this title for the zoning district involved, or section
8-7-3-1 (C) of this chapter, or as may otherwise be established by this title;
   B.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the comprehensive plan and/or this title;
   C.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area;
   D.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   E.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   F.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   G.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors;
   H.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
   I.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of agricultural
lands or any natural open space, scenic, cultural, or historic feature of major
importance without adequate mitigation as determined by the city council. (Ord.
40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980; amd. Ord. 858, 10-26-2021; Ord. 868, 8-8-2022)
8-7-3-3: PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES:
Public sites and open spaces shall conform to the following:
   A.   Public Uses: Where it is determined that a proposed park, playground,
school or other public use shown on the future acquisition map, as authorized
in section 67-6517, Idaho Code, is located in whole or in part within a
proposed development, the commission shall notify the appropriate public agency
concerning the land proposed to be acquired. Within thirty (30) days of the
date of notice, the public agency may request the governing body to suspend
consideration on the permit for sixty (60) days from the date of the request;
however, if an agreement is not reached within sixty (60) days, the commission
shall resume consideration of the conditional use application.
   B.   Natural Features: Existing natural features which add value to
residential development and enhance the attractiveness of the community (such
as trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets) shall
be preserved in the design of the development.
   C.   Special Developments: In the case of planned unit developments and
large scale developments, the council may require sufficient park or open space
facilities of acceptable size, location and site characteristics that may be
suitable for the proposed development. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-7-3-4: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
In granting any conditional use, the council may prescribe appropriate
conditions, bonds and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violations of
such conditions, bonds or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title.
(Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-7-3-5: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Application For Conditional Use Permit: An application for conditional
use permit shall be filed with the administrator by at least one owner or
lessee of property for which such conditional use is proposed. At a minimum,
the application shall contain the following information:
      1.   Name, address and phone number of applicant;
      2.   Legal description of property;
      3.   Description of existing use;

location of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic access and traffic
circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas, utilities,
signs, yards and such other information as the commission may require to
determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of
this title; and
      7.   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property;
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and
other properties in the district; and the relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan.
   B.   Supplemental Information: Prior to granting a conditional use permit,
the council may request studies from the planning staff or public agencies
concerning social, economic, fiscal and environmental effects on the proposed
conditional use. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
   C.   Procedure For Approval Of Conditional Use Permit: The commission shall
hold a public hearing on each conditional use permit application as specified
in section
8-7-8 of this chapter. The council may approve, conditionally approve or deny a
conditional use permit under the conditions as herein specified and considering
such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of this title.
      1.   Public Hearing, Notice: Prior to granting a conditional use permit,
the commission shall hold a public hearing in which interested persons shall
have an opportunity to be heard. That public hearing shall be scheduled within
thirty (30) days of receipt of an application. Notice shall be provided as
required by section
8-7-8 of this chapter.
      2.   Action By The Commission And Council: Within fifteen (15) days after
the public hearing, the commission shall transmit its recommendation of
approval or denial to the council. Within forty five (45) days after receipt of
the commission's recommendation, the council shall approve or deny the
application. The city council shall follow notice and hearing requirements set
forth in section
8-7-8 of this chapter. If the application is approved or approved with
modifications, the council shall direct the administrator to issue a
conditional use permit listing the specific conditions specified by the council
for approval.
Upon granting or denying an application, the council shall specify:
         a.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
         b.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         c.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit. (Ord. 270, 5-29-1996)
      3.   Notice To Applicant: Within ten (10) days after a decision has been
rendered, the administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice of
the action on the request.
   D.   Conditions Of Permit: Upon the granting of a conditional use permit,
conditions may be attached to said permit including, but not limited to, those:
      1.   Minimizing adverse impact on other development;
      2.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development;
      3.   Controlling the duration of development;
      4.   Assuring that development is maintained properly;

in this title. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
   E.   Transfer Of Permit: A conditional use permit is not transferable from
one parcel of land to another. Conditional use permits are an entitlement to
the specific property on which the approval was granted and upon any transfer
of title for the property the conditional use permit transfers to the new owner
(s) without further application or approval, provided, however, the new owner
(s) shall be bound by the same conditions of approval applicable to the
conditional use permit that was transferred. The new owner(s) shall provide
written acknowledgement to the city accepting the terms of the transferred
conditional use permit within sixty (60) days of purchase and receipt by the
new owners of actual notice of the existence of the conditional use permit for
the parcel, whichever event occurs later; otherwise, the permit may be declared
void after notice and public hearing before the city council.
   F.   Effect Of Issuance On Other Conditional Uses: A conditional use permit
shall not be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other
conditional use permits.
   G.   Time Limitations, Extensions:
      1.   Once a conditional use is approved and exercised, said use may
continue without further temporal constraints, provided that the use complies
with its intended purpose, or city approved modifications thereafter, and does
not violate any codes, subject to the following:
         a.   An approved conditional use permit shall be valid for a term
approved and conditioned by the city council.
         b.   An extension of the time limit for an approved conditional use
may be granted by the city council, at its sole discretion, without further
notice and hearing, if the following findings are made:
            (1)   There are no outstanding city code or conditional use permit
violations on the subject property. If such violations exist, they may be
conditioned by the city council to be cured as a condition of the extension of
time;
            (2)   The conditional use, as previously approved, remains in the
best interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the city;
            (3)   There have been no significant changes to this code between
the date of conditional use approval and the date of the time extension request
that would require substantial modifications to the project;
            (4)   There are no hazardous conditions which have developed or
have been discovered on the project site; and
            (5)   The public facilities and services required for the project
remain adequate.
   H.   Modification Of Permit: A conditional use permit may be modified by the
city council after public notice has been provided in accordance with section
8-7-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 647, 11-23-2010; amd. Ord. 827, 10-22-2020)
8-7-4: APPEALS, VARIANCES AND REQUESTS FOR RECONSIDERATION:

appeal shall be filed in accordance with the following procedures:
   A.   Who May Appeal: Appeals may be filed by anyone affected by the
decision.
   B.   Appeal Period: Any appeal shall be filed within fourteen (14) calendar
days after the date of the Zoning Administrator's written decision. If the last

not be accepted.
   C.   Form of Appeal: An appeal shall be filed in writing with the City
Clerk. The appeal shall clearly and concisely state the extent of the appeal,
the applicable code section(s) being appealed, the reason and grounds for the
appeal, and the specific impact on the appellant. The appeal shall be
accompanied by the filing fee established by the City Council.
   D.   Effect of Appeal: An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action taken unless the administrator certifies to the council after the notice
of appeal is filed that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay
would, in the administrator’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life and
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the council or by a court based upon
an application, with notice to the administrator showing due cause.
   E.   Decision on the Appeal: The City Council may affirm, affirm in part,
reverse, or modify the decision being appealed. The City Council may adopt
additional conditions of approval as the facts warrant. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev.

8-7-4-2: VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority To Grant Variances: The council may authorize, in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   B.   Application And Standards For Variance: A variance from the terms of
this title shall not be granted by the council unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the administrator and the council
containing:
      1.   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);
      2.   Legal description of property;
      3.   Description of nature of variance requested; and
      4.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         a.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this title;
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
A variance shall not be granted unless the council makes specific findings of
the fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it which
support conclusions that the above mentioned standards and conditions have been
met by the applicant. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-7-4-3: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the council grant an appeal or variance to allow a
use not permissible under the terms of this title in the district involved, or
any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this title in
said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the council may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violation
of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title.
(Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980)
8-7-4-4: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A VARIANCE:
   A.   Public Hearing, Notice: Prior to granting a variance, public hearings
in which interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard shall be
held. The public hearing before the planning and zoning commission shall be
scheduled after receipt of an application. The commission shall follow the
notice requirements provided by section
8-7-8 of this chapter.
   B.   Action By Commission And Council: After the public hearing, the
commission shall transmit its recommendation of approval, conditional approval
or denial to the council. The city council shall follow the notice requirements
provided by section
8-7-8 of this chapter and, after receipt of the commission's recommendation,
the council shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the request for appeal
or variance.
Upon granting or denying an application, the council shall specify:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
      2.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
variance. (Ord. 270, 5-29-1996)
   C.   Notice To Applicant: After a decision has been rendered, the
administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice of the action on
the request. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev. 9-1980; amd. Ord. 858, 10-26-2021)
8-7-4-5: REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION BY AFFECTED PERSONS:
   A.   Appeals Of City Council Decisions: For any application required or
authorized pursuant to the Local Land Use Planning Act, an affected person may
seek judicial review of any final decision of the city council.
      1.   A decision of the city council is not a final decision until it has
been rendered in writing.
      2.   Any affected person seeking judicial review shall first seek
reconsideration of the final decision within fourteen (14) calendar days. Such
written request shall be provided to the city clerk along with any such fee as
adopted by resolution of the city council and shall identify specific
deficiencies in the decision for which reconsideration is sought and the legal
basis for relief.
      3.   In the event no action is taken by the city council within sixty
(60) calendar days of receipt of a request for reconsideration the request is
deemed denied. If the city council chooses to reconsider the final decision,
the city council shall provide the applicant or affected person a written
decision on such action. The city council may then reopen the matter and have
additional public hearing(s) if it believes additional information is
necessary. The notice for public hearing shall comply with section
8-7-8 of this title.
      4.   Notice To Applicant Or Affected Person: Within ten (10) calendar
days after the written decision has been rendered, the administrator shall
provide the applicant or affected person with a written notice of the action on
the request.
      5.   A failure to request reconsideration is a failure of the applicant
or affected party to exhaust administrative remedies. (Ord. 40, 10-1978, rev.
9-1980; amd. Ord. 820, 12-10-2019; Ord. 858, 10-26-2021)

   D.   General Procedure For Amendments: Zoning districts shall be amended in
the following manner:
      1.   Request for an amendment to this title shall be submitted by the
commission which shall evaluate the request to determine the extent and nature
of the amendment requested.

8-10-1: REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Purpose: Development agreements are a discretionary tool to be used by
the council as a condition of rezoning. Development agreements allow a specific
project with a specific use to be developed on property in an area that is not
appropriate for all uses allowed or conditional in the requested zone.
   B.   Initiation Of Development Agreement:
      1.   A development agreement may be initiated for the rezoning of a
particular parcel of land or collection of parcels of land through the

         b.   On recommendation of the zoning administrator.
         c.   On recommendation of the commission.
         d.   Required by the council.
      2.   In the event of a determination by the commission that a development
agreement should be entered into, the commission shall retain jurisdiction of
the matter, defer consideration of the rezone applied for and set a time limit
for submittal of the development agreement. The commission shall then proceed
as specified in this section.
      3.   In the event of a determination by the council that a development
agreement should be entered into, the council shall remand the matter back to
the commission for submittal of the development agreement. The council may
direct the commission on remand of the matter to the commission. The commission
shall then proceed as specified in this section.
      4.   In the event of either of the above, all time limits required by
this code may be stayed upon affirmative vote of the commission or council.
   C.   Form Of Development Agreement: A development agreement shall be in the
form required by the zoning administrator. No agreement shall be accepted by
the zoning administrator which does not include the following:
      1.   An affidavit by the owner of the parcel agreeing to submit the
parcel to a development agreement.

concept plan may include:
         a.   A description of the density allowed or sought; and
         b.   Maximum height, size, and location of any structures on the
property.
      5.   The time required to begin the use on the property.
      6.   A statement by the owner of the parcel that failure to comply with
the commitments in the development agreement shall be deemed consent to rezone
the use to the preexisting zone or, in the case of an initial zone at
annexation, a zone deemed appropriate by the council.
      7.   Any other matter mutually agreeable to the parties.
   D.   Approval Of The Development Agreement:
      1.   The council may require a development agreement be executed to allow
a rezone if, in the opinion of the council, approval of the requested rezone
does not satisfy the requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance for rezone
approval, but the particular project or use contemplated has a value to the
community that would justify the use of a development agreement. A development
agreement may not allow a use on the parcel that is not an allowed or
conditional use in the requested rezone.
      2.   Development agreements may be recommended by the commission and
approved by the council only after public hearings. Each public hearing shall

development agreement.
   E.   Recordation Of Development Agreement: Following approval of a
development agreement by the city council, the development agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the county recorder at the expense of the property
owner. The development agreement, and all conditions, terms, duties or
obligations included therein, shall run with the land and shall be considered
continuing obligations of the owner or subsequent owner and each other person
acquiring an interest in the property.

which time testimony shall be taken to establish noncompliance with the
conditions, terms, obligations or duties contained within the development
agreement. The public hearing shall follow the notice and hearing provisions of
section 67-6509 of the Idaho Code.
      2.   Upon termination of the development agreement, the property shall
revert to the zone applicable prior to the adoption of the development
agreement or application for rezoning designation change. All uses of the
property which are not consistent with the subsequently applied zone following
termination of the development agreement shall cease. The owner of the parcel
may apply for a conditional use of the parcel if such use is a conditional use
within the subsequently applied zone.
   I.   Enforcement Of Development Agreements: Development agreements may be
enforced by the city through specific enforcement, injunctive relief, damages

be maintained to the minimal property maintenance standards as listed below.
(Ord. 520, 6-28-2005)
8-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:
DAMAGED OR DILAPIDATED BUILDING: Any structure that has suffered significant
damage or deterioration either from age, lack of care, or abandonment or
natural or manmade calamity to the degree that the exterior of the building
walls, roof, doors and windows are burnt out, falling down, or are
significantly patched or boarded or are structurally unsound.
UNFINISHED BUILDING: Any structure where construction has commenced but has
been discontinued for a period of six (6) months and/or has not been finished

8-11-3: MINIMAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE STANDARD:
All damaged, dilapidated or unfinished buildings shall be restored or finished
to eliminate the detrimental visual damage or visual impact of the building(s).
A property owner shall take steps to restore or finish the building(s) per
plans approved by the Eagle city planning and zoning department, Eagle city
planning and zoning commission, Eagle city design review board, or Eagle city
council. No building or premises shall detrimentally impact the surrounding
neighborhood due to dilapidation, deterioration, decay, abandonment or

uncomfortable or inconvenient to the neighborhood. (Ord. 520, 6-28-2005)
8-11-4: RESTORATION OF A DAMAGED OR DILAPIDATED BUILDING OR COMPLETION OF AN
UNFINISHED BUILDING:
Restoration of a damaged or dilapidated building or completion work on an

begun within six (6) months or completed within one year after restoration or
construction work has begun, the city shall order the owner of the property to
attend a prescribed city council meeting to address the reason(s) as to why the
building has not been restored or completed. If the address of the owner of
said building can be obtained through reasonable efforts, then the owner shall
receive notice of said meeting via certified mail. Otherwise notice shall be
sent to the owner of property as it appears on the last equalized assessment

      1.   The preliminary plat shall be null and void if a final plat
application is not received by the city and deemed complete by the Zoning
Administrator within two years from the approval date of the city council
findings of fact and conclusions of law for the preliminary plat.
If an application for extension of time is received by the city prior to the
expiration date of the preliminary plat a maximum twelve (12) month extension
of the time limit on the approved preliminary plat may be granted by the city
council, at its sole discretion, if the following findings are made:
         a.   There are no outstanding city code or plat approval violations on
the subject property. If such violations exist, they may be conditioned by the
city council to be cured as a condition of the extension of time;
         b.   The preliminary plat, as previously approved, remains in the best
interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the city;
         c.   There have been no significant changes to this code between the

approval if it finds that any of the criteria herein are not met.
      3.   This section does not limit the number of extensions the city
council may grant to an applicant so long as the criteria set forth in
subsection E1 of this section are met. Nothing in this section requires the
city council to grant any extension of an approval period. Upon filing an
extension of time application, the timing for expiration of the preliminary
plat shall be tolled until final action on the application has been made by the
City Council.
      4.   Projects with approved phasing plans do not need time extensions, so
long as the construction of improvements do not cease for more than one year in
any given phase.
      5.   In the event that the development of the preliminary plat is made in
successive, contiguous segments through an approved phasing plan in an orderly
and reasonable manner, and conforms to such segments, if submitted within
successive intervals for one year, it may be considered for final approval
without resubmission for preliminary plat approval.
   F.   Modifications of Approved Preliminary Plat: The administrator shall
review the proposed modified preliminary plat and determine the processing
based upon the scope of the change. The modified plat shall be classified in
one of the following three categories and shall be processed as stated:
      1.   No material change: If the administrator determines that the
modification(s) do not constitute a material change to the approved preliminary
plat, the modified plat may be approved by the city council as a part of the
final plat application. To determine no material change the administrator shall
find that:
         a.   The modified preliminary plat is in compliance with all
applicable codes, regulations and conditions of approval; and
         b.   The number of lots (not including common lots) have not
increased; and
         c.   That the street configuration has not substantially changed.
      2.   Minor material change: If the administrator determines that the
modification(s) constitute a minor material change to the approved preliminary
plat, the modified plat shall be scheduled for decision by the City Council
through a public hearing with public notice as required within Section
8-7-8, except that an additional neighborhood meeting shall not be required. To
determine minor material change the administrator shall find that:
         a.   The modified preliminary plat is in compliance with all
applicable codes and regulations; and
         b.   One or more of the conditions of approval are being requested to
be deleted or modified; and
         c.   The number of lots (not including common lots) have not
increased; and
         d.   The street configuration has not substantially changed.
      3.   Major material change: If the administrator determines that the
modification(s) constitute a major material change to the approved preliminary
plat, the modified plat shall be scheduled for recommendation by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and decision by the City Council, both through the public
hearing process with public notice and an additional neighborhood meeting as
required within Section 8-7-8. To determine major material change the
administrator shall find that the modified plat cannot meet the findings
required for sections 1 or 2 above. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 647, 11-23-
2010; Ord. 820, 12-10-2019; Ord. 827, 10-22-2020; Ord. 858, 10-26-2021)

area open space. The term "direct access" means all building lots are to be
located a maximum of two hundred fifty feet (250') away from a pathway
connecting to a common area open space lot. Building lots separated from a
common area open space lot by a local roadway shall be deemed to have achieved
direct access. The required planter strip located between the sidewalk and the
street will not be permitted to fulfill this requirement.
      4.   Ownership And Management Of Open Space:
         a.   Ownership Of Open Space: The applicant must identify the owner of
the open space who is responsible for maintaining the open space and facilities
located thereon. If a homeowners' association is the owner, membership in the
association shall be mandatory and automatic for all homeowners of the
subdivision and their successors. If a homeowners' association is the owner,
the homeowners' association shall have lien authority to ensure the collection
of dues from all members. The responsibility for maintaining the open space and
any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the owner.
         b.   Management Plan: Applicant shall submit a plan for management of
open space and common facilities (plan) that:
            (1)   Allocates responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance
and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon, including
provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long term capital improvements;
            (2)   Estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for
maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines
the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided;
            (3)   Provides that any changes to the plan be approved by the city
council; and
            (4)   Provides for enforcement of the plan.
         c.   Temporary Maintenance By City; Corrective Action: In the event
the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all
or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the city of Eagle may assume
temporary responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and
take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The
costs of such maintenance shall be charged to the owner, homeowners'
association, or to the individual property owners that make up the homeowners'
association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs
shall become a lien on all subdivision properties. The exercise by the city of
Eagle of its right to assume temporary maintenance responsibility to take
corrective action shall not relieve the property owner of their maintenance
responsibility nor should it be construed as the city assuming permanent
responsibility for such maintenance. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
9-3-9: WATER SYSTEM:
The provision of a public water system shall conform to the following
standards:
   A.   All subdivisions within the Eagle city water service area shall comply

Any fencing located adjacent to common area open spaces and on the street side
of all corner lots shall be an open fencing style such as wrought iron or other
similar decorative style, durable fencing material, unless the fence is located
on the property line between the required roadway buffer area and the
residential lot, in which case the fence may be a solid wood picture frame or
premium vinyl picture frame fence as identified in the EASD book. If the buffer
area is designed so that the fence is visible from the adjacent roadway, then
the fence shall include decorative columns spaced a maximum of sixty feet (60')
apart. Specific buffer area fences and decorative walls may be allowed as
otherwise required in subsection
8-2A-7J of this code. Chain link, cedar, and similar high maintenance and/or
unsightly fencing shall not be permitted within the above designated areas. A
section within the subdivision CC&Rs shall be created for the regulation of
fences to this effect. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 820, 12-10-2019)

(Ord. 566, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 820, 12-10-2019; Ord. 827, 10-22-2020; Ord.
858, 10-26-2021; Ord. 868, 8-8-2022; Ord. 897, 6-27-2023)
9-4-1-7: SIDEWALK DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Sidewalks, a minimum five feet (5') wide, shall be required on both
sides of the street; except, that where the average width of lots, as measured
at the street frontage line or at the building setback line, is over one
hundred feet (100'), and the street is designated a local street, sidewalks on
only one side of the street may be allowed. This sidewalk exception shall not
be permitted on collectors, arterials, or section line streets.
   B.   Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with the standards and specifications of the Ada County Highway
District.
   C.   Sidewalks shall be separated from the edge of the abutting roadway and/
or back of curb by a minimum eight foot (8') wide landscape strip. The
landscape strip shall be completed with sod, automatic irrigation, and planted
with two inch (2") minimum caliper shade class trees along all streets within
the subdivision. Installation of landscaping shall be in accordance with
section
8-2A-7 of this code. The area within the eight foot (8') wide landscape strip
may be counted toward the minimum required common area open space.
   D.   Trees shall be placed at the front of each lot generally located on
each side lot line. Minor variations to the location of a tree may be
considered by the design review board during the review of the subdivision
landscape plan.
   E.   If sidewalk is required on one side of each street only (as provided
for in subsection A of this section), then the trees on the side of the street
with no sidewalk shall be placed within five feet (5') of the edge of roadway.
   F.   In zoning districts which prohibit densities greater than one dwelling
unit per two (2) acres and at the council's discretion, a five foot (5') wide
striped path (with pedestrian designation markings such as diamonds or
pedestrian/bicycle symbols) on both edges of all internal roadways may be
permitted in lieu of constructing sidewalks. Trees shall be placed within five
feet (5') of the edge of roadway. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 868, 8-8-
2022)
9-4-1-8: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
Underground utilities are required. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
9-4-1-9: WATER SUPPLY AND SEWER SYSTEMS:
   A.   Construction; Extension: All public water supply or sewer systems
(serving 2 or more separate premises or households) shall be constructed in
accordance with any adopted local plans and specifications. All new public
water supply or sewer systems shall be an extension of an existing public
system whenever possible. In the event that the proposed public water supply or
sewer system is not an extension of an existing public system, there shall be a
showing by the subdivider that the extension is not feasible and not in the
best interest of the public.
   B.   Approval Of Plans: All water and sewer plans shall be submitted to the
Idaho department of health and welfare or its authorized agent for approval in
accordance with the provisions of section 50-1326, Idaho Code.
   C.   Pressurized Irrigation Facilities:
      1.   All residential dwelling units and subdivision common areas shall be
provided with a pressurized irrigation system to be served with irrigation
water from a surface water right unless a waiver, as outlined herein, is
approved by the city council.
The city has adopted supplemental standards and regulations (titled "Pressure
Irrigation Standards", incorporated herein by reference and available at Eagle
city hall) pertaining to the design, construction and maintenance of
pressurized irrigation systems. Plans and documents reflecting the required
standards and regulations shall be submitted with the application for a
preliminary plat.
The following design requirements and the requirements provided within the
supplemental "Pressure Irrigation Standards" shall apply to the pressurized
irrigation system. These standards shall supplement all other regulations, and
where at variance with other laws, regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the
more restrictive requirements shall apply. The council may determine that
revisions to the supplemental standards are warranted and make such revisions
by act of a resolution.
         a.   The pressurized irrigation system may have a backup connection to
a potable water system with the approval of the city, city engineer, and the
potable water purveyor, and the installation of a state approved reduced
pressure backflow prevention assembly or an air gap separating the irrigation
system and the potable water system. The operation, maintenance, associated
costs, and annual inspection of the backup connection and the backup system's
reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly shall be the responsibility of
the entities as determined in "Pressure Irrigation Standards" of this section.
Individual backup connections to individual lots by individual lot owners shall
be prohibited with the exception of the common area lots owned and maintained
by the homeowners' association.
         b.   The pressurized irrigation system shall be designed by a licensed
professional engineer registered in the state of Idaho, and the construction
plans for the system shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer.
      2.   The requirement for installation of a pressurized irrigation system
may be waived by the city council when the applicant has established that any
of the following situations exist (the sale or transfer of an existing water
right shall not be grounds for requesting a waiver pursuant to this provision):
         a.   Where a sufficient surface irrigation water right does not exist
for the property. The lack of surface irrigation water right shall be
documented in writing by the appropriate irrigation district or canal company
and the department of water resources and shall be submitted with the
subdivision preliminary plat. In this case a waiver shall only be granted for
that portion of the subdivision that cannot be served.
         b.   Where an existing surface water right cannot be delivered to the
property by an irrigation district or canal company due to current delivery
capacity or scheduling. In these situations the city council may still require
the installation of the pressure irrigation system, provided water rights can
be made available to the property and delivery system modifications can be made
so irrigation water can be supplied within two (2) years.
         c.   Where the applicant has provided for another means of delivery
such as flood irrigation, if approved by the city engineer. The applicant shall
present the proposed alternative delivery system to the city engineer at the
time the waiver is requested.
         d.   That due to the specific circumstances surrounding a new
subdivision, the cost of obtaining water rights, reestablishing water rights or
developing the system would impose an undue economic hardship on the developer.
For purposes of this section, an undue economic hardship shall consist of a
showing that the cost per lot to develop the pressurized irrigation system
would be twenty five percent (25%) higher than the cost per lot for providing a
pressurized irrigation system to subdivisions of similar size and density
constructed in the city within the previous two (2) years; or the cost per lot
of the pressurized irrigation system would exceed five percent (5%) of the
expected per lot market value of the subdivision.
The developer shall bear the burden of providing documentation, acceptable to
the city engineer and city council, demonstrating and supporting the estimated
costs of construction of the pressurized irrigation system, and the cost per
lot for irrigation systems in those subdivisions built in the last two (2)
years as noted above, and the expected market value of the subdivision lots.
For phased developments, costs will be analyzed over all phases of the
development rather than the first phase only.
      3.   Should installation of a pressurized irrigation system be waived by
the city engineer, as outlined herein, compliance to Idaho Code 31-3805 is
still required.
      4.   Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the city with the
preliminary plat application and shall be accompanied by an irrigation report,
prepared by a licensed Idaho registered professional engineer, stating the
location and availability of surface irrigation water and documenting the basis
for the waiver request. If applicable, the irrigation report shall be
accompanied by a letter from the irrigation district or canal company stating
that water rights and/or a delivery system are not available to the property.
(Ord. 566, 5-15-2007; amd. Ord. 820, 12-10-2019)
9-4-1-10: STORM DRAINAGE; FLOOD CONTROLS 1 :
   A.   Adequate Storm Drainage System: An adequate storm drainage system to
accommodate storm water runoff from the public rights of way shall be required
in all subdivisions. The requirements for each particular subdivision shall be
established by the Ada County highway district and/or the Idaho transportation
department, and construction shall follow the specifications and procedures
established by said Ada County highway district or Idaho transportation
department.
   B.   Interceptor Ditches: Interceptor ditches shall be established above all
cut/fill slopes, and the intercepted water conveyed to a stable channel or
natural drainageway with adequate capacity.
   C.   Curb, Gutter And Pavement Design: Curb, gutter and pavement design
shall be such that water on roadways is prevented from flowing off the roadway.
   D.   Natural Drainageway Treatment: Natural drainageways shall be riprapped
or otherwise stabilized below drainage and culvert discharge points for a
distance sufficient to convey the discharge without channel erosion.
   E.   Runoff From Impervious Cover: Runoff from areas of concentrated
impervious cover (for example, roofs, driveways and roads) shall be collected
and transported to a natural drainageway with sufficient capacity to accept the
discharge without undue erosion.
   F.   Deposit Of Waste Material Prohibited: Waste material from construction,
including soil and other solid materials, shall not be deposited within the
100-year floodplain.
   G.   Drainageways Or Hydraulic Structures In Major Waterways: Drainageways
or hydraulic structures in major waterways (defined as draining a basin area of
10 acres or more) shall be designed for the 100-year flood or to accommodate
the runoff projected in the soil conservation service hydrology guide for
residential development of the Boise front, whichever is greater. In minor
waterways (defined as draining a basin area of less than 10 acres), such
structures shall be designed for the 50-year flood or to accommodate the runoff
projected in the soil conservation service hydrology guide for residential
development of the Boise front, whichever is greater.
   H.   Storm Drainage Retention Facilities: On site retention or partial on
site retention of storm drainage from new developments is required in any case
where, due to development activity, such drainage would be increased either in
peak flow rate or in total quantity from that previously discharged from the
land or property being developed. Complete retention is required in all cases
except those where: 1) runoff flows directly, without crossing intervening
property, into an existing drain ditch or other drainage facility that is
operated and maintained by a drainage receiver, and 2) such drainage receiver
agrees, as evidenced by valid and binding public document, to receive a certain
definite quantity of storm drainage from the development. Retention on site of
any drainage not so accepted by a drainage receiver or of any drainage in
excess of the quantity accepted by a drainage receiver is a duty of the current
property owner at any time.
Retention or partial retention facilities shall be provided as an essential
part of such development. Design and construction of such retention facilities
shall conform to standards, entitled "Design Standards For Storm Drainage
Retention Facilities", adopted by resolution of the city council, and which
standards may, from time to time, be amended by subsequent resolution of the
council. All facilities shall be maintained on an ongoing basis in order to

the city council unless there is a finding, upon recommendation by the
commission, as a result of a public hearing, that all of the following exist:
      1.   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this title would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable. In such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provision or requirement
involved.
      2.   Strict compliance with the requirements of this title would result
in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography,
other physical conditions or other such conditions which are not self-
inflicted, or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement
of the objectives of this title.
      3.   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the
property is situated.
      4.   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code.
      5.   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of this title and the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 566, 5-15-2007)
9-6-4: AMENDMENTS:
The city council may, from time to time, amend, supplement or repeal the
regulations and provisions of this title upon recommendation from the
commission in the following manner:

10-1-1: FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by structures which are inadequately
anchored, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by
the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood
heights and velocities.
      3.   Flooding is aggravated by the collection of debris upstream of the
many channel obstructions located in the floodplain areas. Such obstructions
include bridges, fences, houses, trees, etc. The accumulation of debris has
resulted in significantly higher water surface elevations upstream from the
obstructions than would otherwise be expected. Obstructions can and tend to
cause flooding to extend beyond anticipated FEMA 100-year flood boundaries at
points of debris accumulation which cannot be predicted.
      4.   All structures located roughly within the limits of the 500-year
floodplain are subject to inundation, if not directly impacted by the channel
itself, during floods of return frequencies of ten (10) to twenty (20) years.
This is due to the tendency of the channel to change abruptly, often cutting a
totally new channel in a few hours, during high water periods, because the
Boise River is wide, flat and has relatively shallow channel in many areas.
      5.   The levees built by private property owners may be considered by
FEMA to be inadequately designed or deteriorated such that they cannot be
classified as permanent structures capable of withstanding a 100-year flood;
and, therefore, may result in higher risk and be included in the area of
special flood hazard.
      6.   Encroachments (i.e., houses, fill, etc.) on floodplains reduce the
flood carrying capacity and increase flood heights, thus increasing flood
hazards beyond the encroachment. With every new structure or other development
since the FEMA 100-year flood boundary was determined, the ability of the
floodplain to function changes.
      7.   The Boise River and its tributaries and floodplains in Eagle are
essential to the well being of its citizens as a source of recreation, fish and
wildlife habitat, aesthetic beauty, and a source of irrigation water as well as
other economic and lifestyle values.
      8.   Development adjacent to waterways has had a direct effect on the
natural stream by destroying or greatly altering fish and wildlife habitat and
by unnaturally armoring the banks of the waterways to prevent erosion and
damage riparian areas thus resulting in increased risk to manmade structures.
      9.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management.
   B.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
      1.   To protect human life, health, and property;
      2.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special
flood hazard;
      6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      7.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard, warn that city review and approval is not going
to prevent flooding and that flooding may occur, and advise of information
available to the city regarding flood hazards, studies and available options;
      8.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      9.   To provide a formal procedure for evaluation of floodplain
development permit applications;
      10.   To restrict or prohibit uses which are injurious to health, safety
or property in times of flood, which result in environmental damage, or that
cause increased flood heights or velocities;
      11.   To minimize the impact of development adjacent to waterways on
adjacent properties upstream, downstream and across waterways;
      12.   To review development plans for property adjacent to waterways to
minimize the obstruction of the conveyance of floodwaters, review drainage/
obstructions to flood carrying capacity, and guide development adjacent to
waterways toward the most appropriate building envelope for its particular
site;
      13.   To carry out the provisions of the comprehensive plan as well as
health, safety and welfare with regard to properties adjacent to waterways;
      14.   To review landscaping and access for flood carrying capacity and
preservation or enhancement of riparian vegetation;
      15.   To allow the river and creeks and their adjacent lands to convey
floodwaters to minimize property damage;
      16.   To regulate uses in the floodplain for the purpose of preserving,
protecting, and enhancing the abundance and diversity of fish, wildlife and
riparian resources; and
      17.   To protect, preserve and enhance the waterways and floodplains as a
recreation resource.

10-1-2: OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
   B.   Requiring that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels and natural
protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 82, 12-14-1982; amd. Ord. 815, 7-23-2019)
10-1-3: INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho, pursuant to
Idaho Code sections 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local governments to
adopt floodplain management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum
floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human
life, health, and property.
   B.   Jurisdiction And Interpretation: This title shall apply to all special
flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the city. In the interpretation
and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the city; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
provisions of the Idaho Code.
   C.   Conflicting Laws: This title does not in any way repeal, abrogate,
impair, or remove the necessity of compliance with any other laws, ordinances,
regulations, easements, covenants or deed restrictions, and the like. However,
where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 700A, 3-11-2014; amd. Ord. 815, 7-
23-2019)
10-1-4: COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, developed, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 82, 12-14-1982; amd. Ord. 815, 7-23-2019)
10-1-5: RULES AND DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below or in section
8-1-2 of this code, certain words or phrases used in this title shall be
interpreted as set forth in said section
8-1-2 of this code. Any other terms or words not defined below or in section
8-1-2 of this code shall be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they
have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
As used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE): A structure on the same lot or
parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING): An extension or increase in the floor area
or height of a building or structure.
APPEAL: A request to the city council for a review of the floodplain
administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOOD HAZARD: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH zone on a
community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the federal insurance
admininstrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRAWL SPACE: The area of a house or structure between the lowest finish floor
and the bottom of the foundation excavation enclosed by continuous foundation
walls.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
was the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum
currently adopted by the federal government as a basis for measuring heights is
the north american vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings or other
structures, mining dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling
operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM): The digital official map of a
community, issued by the federal emergency management agency, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The elevation certificate is an important administrative
tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; it is used to document elevation information necessary to ensure
compliance with community floodplain management regulations; and it may be used
to support a request for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) or letter of map
revision based on fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community, November 20, 1974.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: See EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility of administering the national flood insurance program (NFIP).
FINISHED FLOOR: The finished floor is the first habitable walking surface
referenced in the elevation certificate (FEMA form 81-31 sections C2a and C2b)
as the top of the next highest floor or the top of a slab on grade floor.
FLOOD or FLOODING:
   A.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source; or
      3.   Mudslides (mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as
defined in division A2 of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and
flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is
carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.
   B.   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in division A1 of this definition.
FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by
floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map of a community, issued by the
federal insurance administrator which delineates both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM
that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate
map (DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The examination, evaluation, and determination of
flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (mudflow) and/or
flood-related hazards.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
   A.   In special flood hazard areas where base flood elevations (BFEs) have
been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet (2') of
freeboard; and
   B.   In special flood hazard areas where no BFE has been established, this
elevation shall be at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of flooding
in the area.
FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA: The land that has been or may be covered by
floodwaters, or is surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the
occurrence of the regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the
floodway and the flood fringe.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The zoning administrator, or an individual designated
by the zoning administrator, to administer and implement this chapter in
accordance with its provisions.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation (BFE) plus the
freeboard established the flood protection elevation (FPE). FREEBOARD shall be
two feet (2').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDANT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA elevation certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. department of interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the secretary of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1.   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior, or
      2.   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
   A.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective national flood insurance program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
ground above the base flood elevation.
   B.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or a flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) or
both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or
flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM), and sometimes the flood insurance study
(FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the
modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the
affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
   C.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of
the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
The LOMR-F does not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
   D.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies
with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to
delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the
effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or flood insurance study (FIS). Upon
submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a letter of map
revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building
permits and/or flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR,
because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA elevation certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement
or crawl space). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44 CFR Part 60.3 and this
chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis, and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain
management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. The term "manufactured home" does
not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. MARKET VALUE may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN HIGH WATER MARK: A water level corresponding to the natural or ordinary
high water mark and is the line which the water impresses on the soil by
covering it for sufficient periods of time to deprive the soil of its
terrestrial vegetation and destroy its value for commonly accepted agricultural
purposes. The current mean high water mark is at a flow of six thousand five
hundred (6,500) cubic feet per second (cfs) along the Boise River. Tributary
waters within the city of Eagle will reference specific data establishing the
water level. The mean high water mark is established by the U.S. army corps of
engineers.
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT: Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities.
MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (mudflow) damage,
including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide control
works, and floodplain management regulations.
MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a federal program created
by congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after November 20, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
NO ADVERSE IMPACT: Floodplain management where the action of one property owner
does not adversely impact public property or other private property, as
measured by increased flood peaks, flood stage, flood velocity, and erosion and
sedimentation. No adverse impact floodplain management is a policy which
provides a means to promote the use of retention/detention or other techniques
to mitigate increased runoff from urban areas.
NONRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE: A building other than a residential structure. The
term includes, but it is limited to: buildings used for places of assembly,
education, childcare, business, maintenance, storage, manufacturing,
government, hospitals, sanatoriums, and nursing homes.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) or after November 20, 1974.

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See FLOODWAY.
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
ten (10) year period since 1978.

tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of these regulations, the term SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure or site, such as the pouring
of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns; or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundation. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
STREAM ALTERATION: To obstruct, diminish, destroy, alter, modify, relocate, or
change the natural existing shape of the channel or to change the direction of
flow of water of any stream channel within or below the mean high water mark.
It includes removal of material from the stream channel and emplacement of
material or structures in the stream channel.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a building whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed forty percent (40%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood-related damage sustained
by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See definition of SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds forty percent (40%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
chapter.
TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS:
   A.   FEMA publications that provide guidance concerning the building
performance standards of the NFIP, which are contained in 44 CFR Part 60.3. The
bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by state and local
officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by
members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
   B.   It should be noted that TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS
provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
UNNUMBERED "A ZONE": An area shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as an
"A zone" in which base flood depths and a clearly defined channel are not
shown.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this title which permits
construction of a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the finished construction elevation certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR Parts
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the north american vertical datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. WATERCOURSE
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur.

additions, rehabilitations, renovations, and any other improvement of or work
on such buildings and structures, the floodplain administrator, in coordination
with the building official, shall:
      1.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or

      1.   For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the floodplain administrator an as built certification
of the floor elevation or floodproofing level, using appropriate FEMA elevation
or floodproofing certificate, immediately after the lowest floor or
floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for nonresidential
structures, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same.
      2.   Certificate deficiencies identified by the floodplain administrator
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to work
proceeding. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the corrections

   A.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available,
either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source,
applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed
construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness
is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks,
photographs of past flooding, and any other relevant factors, where applicable.
Failure to elevate at least two feet (2') above grade in these zones may result
in higher insurance rates.
   B.   Construction Materials And Methods: All new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage and using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, “Flood
Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements”, and available from the Federal

replacement of a building (within the original footprint) or structure existing
on the effective date of this chapter and located totally or partially within
the floodway, flood fringe area, or stream setback, provided there is no
additional encroachment below the flood protection elevation in the floodway,
flood fringe area, or stream setback, and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, construction within the original
building footprint and in conformance with the substantial improvement
criteria.
   G.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in section 10-1-10. A structure
or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or to the
operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility may be
located in a special flood hazard area only if the structure or tank is either
elevated or floodproofed to at least the flood protection elevation and
certified in accordance with the provisions of section 10-1-8-2K.
   H.   When a structure is partially located within an area of special flood
hazard, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction
and substantial improvements.
   I.   When a structure is located within multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for

elevation (BFE) shall apply.
   J.   Certification Requirements:
      1.   Elevation Certificates:
         a.   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 86-0-33) is required prior to
the actual start of any new construction for all structures included within or
removed from the special flood hazard area (SFHA). It shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification of the
elevation of the lowest floor, in relation to mean sea level. The floodplain
administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
         b.   The floodplain administrator may require an elevation certificate
(FEMA Form 86-0-33) after the lowest floor is established. If required, within
seven (7) calendar days of establishment of the lowest floor elevation, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain
administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, in relation
to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven (7) day calendar period and
prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk.
The floodplain administrator shall review the certificate data submitted.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder
immediately and prior to further work being permitted to proceed. Failure to
submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause
to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         c.   (1)   A final as-built finished construction elevation
certificate (FEMA Form 86-0-33) is required for all structures included within
or removed from the special flood hazard area (SFHA) after construction is
completed and prior to certificate of occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty
of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification
of final as-built construction of the elevation of the lowest floor and all
attendant utilities. The floodplain administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of occupancy issuance. In
some instances, another certification may be required to certify corrected as-
built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.
            (2)   The finished construction elevation certificate certifier
shall provide at least two (2) photographs showing the front and rear of the
building taken within ninety (90) days from the date of certification. The
photographs must be taken with views confirming the building description and
diagram number provided in divison A. To the extent possible, these photographs
should show the entire building including foundation. If the building has
split-level or multi-level areas, provide at least two (2) additional
photographs showing side views of the building. In addition, when applicable,
provide a photograph of the foundation showing a representative example of the
flood openings or vents. All photographs must be in color and measure at least
three inches (3") by three inches (3"). Digital photographs are acceptable.
      2.   Floodproofing Certificate: If non-residential floodproofing is used
to meet the flood protection elevation requirements, a floodproofing
certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan,
and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start
of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the floodplain administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the lowest floor and all attendant utilities, in relation to mean
sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
floodplain administrator shall review the certificate data, the operational
plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such
review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to
submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause
to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance
with the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
certificate of compliance/occupancy.
      3.   If a manufactured home is placed within zone A, AE, AH, AO, or A1-30
and the elevation of the chassis is more than thirty six inches (36") in height

10-1-8-6: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all cases of special flood hazards where base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided as set forth in section
10-1-6 of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall be required:
   A.   Residential Construction:
      1.   Connection to a central sewage treatment system shall be required.
This requirement may be waived by the city council if the Central district
health department recommends approval of an alternate method of sewage
treatment and disposal. Residential development within the floodplain may be
clustered (through approval of a PUD) to facilitate the economics of the sewage
infrastructure.
      2.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest finished floor
elevated no lower than the flood protection elevation, as defined in section
10-1-5, and the lowest floor, including basement and crawl space, shall be
elevated to a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
      3.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings on different sides having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.
         c.   If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit.
         d.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than
one foot (1') above the interior or exterior adjacent grade.
         e.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         f.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      4.   Additions/Improvements:
         a.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         b.   Additions to post-FIRM structures that are a substantial
improvement with no modifications to the existing structure other than a
standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with
the standards for new construction.
         c.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         d.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten
(10) year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds forty percent
(40%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building
or structure, the ten (10) year period begins on the date of the first
improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective
date of this chapter. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
            (1)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
            (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      5.   Mechanical and Other Service Equipment:
         a.   All mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and other service equipment
servicing residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
elevated to a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation (BFE).
This includes, but is not limited to, HVAC systems, furnaces, hot water
heaters, and electrical panels.
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor elevated to no lower than the flood
protection elevation, as defined in section
10-1-5; or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
      1.   Be floodproofed to a point two feet (2') above the base flood
elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
      2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
10-1-9B of this chapter.
      4.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must
meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection A of this section.
      5.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood
level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).
   C.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   New, substantially damaged, substantially improved, and replacement
manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home, including the basement, and all mechanical, electrical,
plumbing, and other service equipment, are no lower than the flood protection
elevation, as defined in section
10-1-5.
      2.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the Idaho division of building safety's "Idaho Manufactured
      Home Installation Standard" in accordance with Idaho Code, section 44-
2201(2). Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the
chassis thirty six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis
shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the
elevation of the chassis is above thirty six (36) inches in height, an
engineering certification is required.
      3.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of section
10-1-8-6A3.
      4.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This plan shall be
filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency
management coordinator.
   D.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall be either: In all
areas of special flood hazard (ASFH), recreational vehicles must be either:
      1.   Temporary Placement: Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and
has no permanently attached additions); or
      2.   Permanent Placement: Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction, as set forth in section
10-1-8-2.
   E.   Temporary Non-Residential Structures: Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.
The following information shall be submitted in writing to the floodplain
administrator for review and written approval:
      1.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be
permitted. Time specified may not exceed six (6) months, renewable up to one

responsible for physical removal of the structure; and
      5.   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the
special flood hazard area, to which the temporary structure will be moved.
   F.   Accessory Structures: When accessory structures (sheds, detached
garages, and the like) are to be placed within a special flood hazard area,
elevation or
      floodproofing certifications are required for all accessory structures
(except as exempted below) in accordance with section
10-1-8-2B and/or J2 and the following criteria shall be met:
      1.   Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation
(including working, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas);
      2.   Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
      3.   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
      4.   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building

10-1-8-7: FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY STANDARDS:
   A.   Standards For Floodplains Without Established Base Flood Elevations
(BFE):
   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as zone A (also known as
unnumbered A zones) and established in section 10-1-6, where no base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in
addition to the provisions of section 10-1-8-2 and section 10-1-8-6, shall
apply.
   The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be
based on the following criteria:
      1.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in section
10-1-8-6.
      2.   When floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway areas
shall also comply with the requirements of sections
10-1-8-2 and
10-1-8-6.
      3.   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home
sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in
accordance with section
10-1-6 and utilized in implementing this chapter. The applicant/developer shall
submit an application for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) prior to
preliminary plat approval and have obtained a letter of map revision (LOMR)
prior to any building permits for structures being issued.
      4.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non- residential) to two feet (2') above the highest
adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection elevation
(FPE) whichever is higher, as defined in section
10-1-5. All other applicable provisions of section
10-1-8-6 shall also apply.
   B.   Standards For Rivervine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways:
Along rivers and streams where base flood elevations (BFE) data is provided by
FEMA or is available from another source but floodway areas are not identified
for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or is in the FIS report, the
following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:
      1.   Standards of section
10-1-8-6.
      2.   Until a regulatory floodway or flood fringe area is designated, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or
other developments shall be permitted unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood at any point within the community.
   C.   Standards For Floodways And Flood Fringe Areas: Areas designated as
floodways are located within special flood hazard areas established in section
10-1-6. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectile and erosion potential. The
following provisions apply:
      1.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, are prohibited unless an approved
floodplain development permit is issued demonstrating that encroachments shall
not result in any adverse impacts during the occurrence of the base flood.
      2.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development are prohibited unless certification by a
registered professional hydraulic engineer is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge; and uses within the floodway shall be
restricted to those which are required by public necessity (for example,
bridges, water pumps); recreational use (for example, paths); wildlife habitat
improvements (for example, vegetation, nesting structures, pool/riffle
improvements); and gravel extraction; provided that the use/encroachment meets
the approval of the federal emergency management agency and national flood
insurance program and does not jeopardize the city's participation in the
national flood insurance program.
      3.   Division C1 of this section shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of this section
10-1-8.
      4.   The placement of any mobile homes, as defined in section
8-1-2 of this code, is prohibited.
      5.   All buildings shall be set back a minimum of one hundred feet (100')
from the floodway line. Except that when the special flood hazard area boundary
is one hundred feet (100') or less from the floodway line, the boundary line
shall be the setback line.
      6.   No development is permitted within the twenty five foot (25')
setback from all waterways called the riparian zone and riparian vegetation
shall be maintained in its natural state for the protection and stabilization
of the riverbank, and removal of trees or other vegetation is regulated in
accordance with this chapter.
      7.   For all subdivisions along the Boise River or Dry Creek, prior to
approval of the final plat written approval from flood control district 10 is
required to protect access to the river for maintenance.
      8.   Compensating excavation in accordance with an engineered plan for
orderly conveyance of floodwater, or equivalent mitigating measures may be
performed in the floodway when certified by a registered professional engineer.
Mitigation design shall include provisions to prevent relocation or diversion
of flow paths from causing increased jeopardy to any off site property at any
level of flooding from the one (1) year flood up to the base flood. Maintenance
provisions for excavated areas prone to fill from sediment and other debris
shall follow the requirements of section
9-3-2-5C of this code for private streets.
      9.   In the design of public and private parks and open space areas,
fixed structures or equipment that would impede floodwaters shall not be
permitted within the floodway.
      10.   Any non-floodway area surrounded by the floodway shall be subject
to the conditions of divisions C1 through C9 of this section, unless such area
is accessed by at least one (1) road with suitable structures or culverts to
pass floodwaters. If a bridge is required, it shall be elevated one foot (1')
above the base flood elevation, have scour resistant footings extending to five
feet (5') below the bottom of the channel and be capable of supporting an H-15
load as defined by the american association of state highway and transportation
officials (AASHTO).
      11.   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by
FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6)
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
   D.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH):
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 10-1-6,
are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to sections 10-1-8-2 and 10-1-8-6,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following
requirements:
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least three
feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in section
10-1-8-7D1 so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with sections
10-1-8-2K and
10-1-8-6B.
      3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   E.   Riparian Areas: Located within areas of special flood hazard,
established in section
10-1-6, are areas designated as riparian areas. Since riparian areas provide
critical flood management and fish and wildlife habitat, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   Preservation or restoration of the inherent natural characteristics
of the river and creeks within the floodplain;
      2.   Preservation of riparian vegetation and wildlife habitat, if any,
along the stream bank and within the required minimum twenty five foot (25')
setback or riparian zone;
      3.   No development or other than development by the city of Eagle or
required for emergency access shall occur within the twenty five foot (25')
riparian zone with the exception of approved stream stabilization work. The
city council may approve access to property where no other primary access is
available. Private pathways and staircases shall not lead into or through the
riparian zone unless deemed necessary by the Eagle city council;
      4.   Plan and time frame shall be provided for restoration of riparian
vegetation damaged as a result of the work done;
      5.   New or replacement planting and vegetation shall include plantings
that are low growing and have dense root systems for the purpose of stabilizing
stream banks and repairing damage previously done to riparian vegetation.
Examples of such plantings include: red osier dogwood, common chokecherry,
serviceberry, elderberry, river birch, skunk bush sumac, Bebb's willow,
Drummond's willow, little wild rose, gooseberry, and honeysuckle.
   F.   Map And Narrative Required: All subdivision proposals and development
permit applications shall provide a map and detailed narrative describing any
abutting or on site manmade topographic features, current or proposed, that
increase flood damage potential above the natural level, including road fills
and other manmade embankments, prior stream channelization, existing and/or
proposed landscaping features, and evident agricultural land leveling that has
altered the floodplain from its original topography.
   G.   Fill Requirements: For fill placed in the floodplain:
      1.   Development within the area of special flood hazard shall result in
no net loss in natural storage. Grading plans shall show that existing natural
storage volume in the floodplain, as bounded by the existing surface topography
and the base flood elevation surface, shall not be reduced from the current
quantity. Postdevelopment storage volumes will be calculated from the
postdevelopment flood elevation for the base flood event. Depressions which
will be filled with groundwater and sections of the floodplain which are
restricted from floodwater conveyance due to roads built above the base flood
elevation shall not be considered when determining storage volumes. Development
within the DDA, TDA or CEDA design review overlay areas shall not be subject to
the provisions of this subsection.
      2.   The slope of fill adjacent to the floodway line, hereinafter called
the floodway boundary slope, shall not be steeper than five horizontal to one
vertical (5:1). Where a five to one (5:1) slope is not feasible due to lot
dimensions, compensating measures to protect against floodway encroachment
through erosion shall be constructed as designed and certified by a
professional engineer, architect, or landscape architect.
      3.   The floodway boundary slope shall be maintained in groomed perennial

equivalent programs to calculate water surface elevations.
      2.   The study report shall include field survey data and relevant bench
marks used as bases of calculations as cross sections, stream profile and plan
showing cross section locations.
      3.   The study report shall attach HEC-2, HEC-RAS, or equivalent input
and output reports as appendices.
      4.   Any floodway or floodplain modification shall not be effective until
approved by FEMA.
      5.   The study shall include a reach of stream extending beyond the
property boundaries of the development upstream and downstream not less than
twice the average width of floodway on or adjacent to the development property,
or as approved by the zoning administrator.
   M.   Critical Facilities: Critical facilities shall not be allowed within
any SFHA, special flood hazard area, including areas designated zone shaded X:
.2% chance of flooding in any given year.

10-1-9: DUTIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   The zoning administrator, or a designated individual, hereinafter
referred to as the floodplain administrator, is hereby appointed to administer
and implement the provisions of this title.
   B.   The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall
include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits for
all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to
assure that all necessary local, state, and federal permits have been received,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 USC § 1334.
      3.   In the event the base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, the federal insurance administrator shall be notified of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with this
part. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
      4.   Upon occurrence, notify the federal insurance administrator in
writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that all FHBM's and FIRM's accurately represent the community's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the community
suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new
area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      5.   Prevent encroachments into floodways and flood fringe areas unless
the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of section
10-1-8-6 are met.
      6.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the
lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new and
substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of section
10-1-8-2K.
      7.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which all
new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been floodproofed,
in accordance with the provisions of section
10-1-8-2K.
      8.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of all
public utilities in accordance with the provisions of section
10-1-8-2K.
      9.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with the provisions of sections 10-1-8-2K and 10-1-8-6B.
      10   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, floodways, or flood fringe areas
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter.
      11.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of section
10-1-6, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data, along with
floodway data or flood fringe area data available from a federal, state, or
other source, including data developed pursuant to section 10-1-8-7, in order
to administer the provisions of this chapter.
      12.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of section 10-1-6,
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data or flood fringe area
data available from a federal, state, or other source in order to administer
the provisions of this chapter.
      13.   When the lowest floor and the lowest adjacent grade of a structure
or the lowest ground elevation of a parcel in a special flood hazard area
(SFHA) is above the base flood elevation (BFE), advise the property owner of
the option to apply for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) from FEMA. Maintain a
copy of the LOMA issued by FEMA in the floodplain development permit file.
      14.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection subject
to Idaho Code title 74, chapter 1, Public Records Act.
      15.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the floodplain administrator
shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that
the work is being done according to the provisions of this chapter and the
terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the floodplain administrator has
a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      16.   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order constitutes a misdemeanor.
      17.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The floodplain
administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may
also be revoked.
      18.   Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The floodplain administrator and each
member of his or her inspections department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      19.   Follow through with corrective procedures of section
10-1-13A.
      20.   Review, provide input, and make recommendations for variance
requests.
      21.   Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to,
the FIS Report, FIRM and other official flood maps, and studies adopted in
accordance with the provisions of section
10-1-6 of this chapter, including any revisions thereto including letters of
map change, issued by FEMA. Notify the NFIP state coordinator and FEMA of your
community's mapping needs.
      22.   Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including letters of
map revision based on fill (LOMR-Fs) and letters of map revision (LOMRs).
      23.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
         a.   Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study, or required as in the preceding division, obtain and record
the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest habitable
floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not the structure contains a basement.
         b.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
            (1)   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level).
            (2)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in section
10-1-8-6B3 of this chapter.
            (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 700A, 3-11-2014; amd. Ord. 815, 7-23-2019)
10-1-10: VARIANCES:
   A.   Application For Variance: A variance from the terms of this chapter
shall not be considered until a written application for a variance containing
the data required by subsection
8-7-4-2B of this code and a narrative statement, demonstrating the requested
variance has mitigated items contained in subsection B of this section, is
filed with the zoning administrator for submission to the city planning and
zoning commission and the city council.
   B.   Procedure For Approval Of Variance:
      1.   Upon receipt of a complete variance application from the zoning
administrator, the city planning and zoning commission and the city council
shall follow the notice and hearing procedures outlined in subsection
8-7-4-4A of this code and action requirements outlined in subsection
8-7-4-4B of this code.
      2.   The city planning and zoning commission may recommend to the city
council that the city council approve, disapprove, or approve conditionally a
requested variance. After receipt of the commission's recommendation and
compliance with subsection
8-7-4-4A of this code, the city council may approve, disapprove or approve
conditionally, by attaching such conditions to the granting of a variance as is
deemed necessary to further the purposes of this chapter, a requested variance.
In making a decision, the city planning and zoning commission and the city
council shall consider all technical evaluations and all relevant factors and
standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its content to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed uses
which are not subject to flooding and erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and the floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      3.   The applicant shall include a written report addressing each of the
above factors in division B2a through B2k with their application for a
variance.
      4.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
      5.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
      6.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management
agency and the state of Idaho upon request.
   C.   Standards And Conditions Of Variance:
      1.   Variances may be issued for:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure on the national
register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places to
preserve the character and design of the structure.
         b.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures of
division B;
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
flood fringe area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variances would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in items contained in section 10-1-7, of this chapter, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      5.   Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
      6.   Variances may be issued for non-residential buildings in very
limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight
or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low
damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria, and otherwise
complies with the general standards.
      7.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification of
the issuance.
   D.   Records And Reports:
      1.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA and the state of Idaho upon
request.
      2.   The floodplain administrator will notify the state NFIP coordinator
of the Idaho department of water resources of its intention to grant a variance
at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to granting a variance.

10-1-11: SCHEDULE OF FEES, CHARGES AND EXPENSES:
The city council, by resolution, shall establish a schedule of fees, charges
and expenses and a collection procedure for development permits, amendments,
appeals, variances, plan approvals and other matters pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of this chapter requiring investigation,
inspection, legal advertising, postage and other expenses 1 . The schedule of
fees shall be posted in the office of the zoning administrator and may be
altered or amended only by the city council. Until all applicable fees, charges
and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any
application or appeal.

Notes
1 1. See subsection
  1-7-4A of this code.
10-1-12: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased
by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the
special flood hazard area or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city, or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
(Ord. 82, 12-14-1982; amd. Ord. 815, 7-23-2019)
10-1-13: CORRECTIVE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the floodplain administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited in such
notification.
   B.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
floodplain administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating:
      1.   That the building or property is in violation of the floodplain
management regulations;
      2.   What is required to bring the building or property into conformnce
with this chapter; and
      3.   If the owner fails to correct the violation the floodplain
administrator may issue an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or
to remove fill as applicable.
   C.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If the owner fails to take action to
bring the building or property into compliance the floodplain administrator
shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood
control ordinance, he or she shall issue an order in writing to the owner,
requiring the owner to remedy the violation within a specified time period, not
less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor more than one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days. Where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent
danger to life or other property, he or she may order that corrective action be
taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
   D.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the zoning administrator within twenty (20) days following
issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the
floodplain administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an
appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke
the order.
   E.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an
appeal, the owner shall be subject to the provisions of section
10-1-14D.
(Ord. 815, 7-23-2019)
10-1-14: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Failure To Obtain A Development Permit: Failure to obtain a development
permit shall be a violation of this chapter.
   B.   Failure To Comply With Permit: Development permits issued on the basis
of plans and applications approved by the zoning administrator authorize only
the use and arrangement set forth in such approved plans and applications, or
amendments thereto, and no other use, arrangement or construction. Use,
arrangement or construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
   C.   Complaints Regarding Violations: Whenever a violation of this chapter
occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
complaint. Such complaint, stating fully the causes and basis thereof, shall be
filed with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall properly
record such complaint, immediately investigate and take action thereon as
provided by this chapter.
   D.   Penalties: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, or altered unless in full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. The city attorney shall, in addition to
taking whatever criminal action deemed necessary, take steps to civilly enjoin
any violation of this title. Penalties for failure to comply with or violations
of the provisions of this title shall be as follows:
