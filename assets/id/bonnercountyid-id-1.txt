This chapter is enacted for the purpose of establishing a regular meeting

activities can be carried out with greater public participation and awareness.
(Ord. 192, 4-9-1990)
   A.   Regular Meeting: The purpose of the regular business meeting is for the
board of county commissioners to conduct the business of Bonner County
publicly. Regular business meetings do not constitute public hearings wherein
the public has the right to be heard on every agendized item. However, at the
discretion of the chair, everyone may be afforded an opportunity to speak on a
particular issue, if recognized by the chair. Any unrecognized comments or
disruptive behavior will be grounds for removal from the board meeting by the
chair and may subject the person being removed to criminal prosecution
according to law.
   B.   Public Comment Segment: The purpose for the public comment segment of
the board of county commissioners business meeting is to enable citizens with
issues or concerns which they wish to bring to the board's attention and afford
an opportunity for consideration on a future agenda for possible board action.
The board will not engage in dialogue with the presenter during this session,
but rather may choose to schedule the presenter's topic for board consideration
at a future business meeting. Questions may be directed to individual board
members for the purpose of clarifying issues or to obtain additional
information for the purpose of scheduling the matter for a future business
meeting. However, no action will be taken on any issue or concern brought to
the board's attention during this session. The chair will not entertain under
any circumstance comments derogatory in nature toward any board member, staff
member, elected official or member of the public. (Ord. 408, 5-31-2001)
   C.   Procedure For Calendaring Item For Consideration By The Board: The
procedure for calendaring shall be determined annually and set forth in the

agendized item.

shall call for a second to said motion. If the motion receives a second from
the other board member, or the chair upon vacating the chair, the chair may
ascertain if there are members of the public who wish to speak to the issue and
the chair may recognize one member of the public at a time. In the event that
any motion does not receive a second, the chair shall declare the motion "dead"
and, absent another motion, the chair shall continue to the next agenda item.
   G.   After having been recognized by the chair, each member of the public
shall state for the record their name and place of residence prior to making
their statement. Questions or comments made by the recognized member of the
public shall be directed to the chair. Statements shall be relevant to the
issue being considered. The chair shall not entertain irrelevant statements,
and shall not entertain statements that are inflammatory, personally attacking
or derogatory toward any board member, staff member, elected official or member
of the public. Members of the public may be permitted to speak for three (3)
minutes and will not be afforded another opportunity until all members of the
public have had an opportunity to speak. A three (3) minute rebuttal or offer
of further testimony may then be permitted at the discretion of the chair.
   H.   After all persons recognized by the chair on the item being considered
have had an opportunity to speak, the chair shall ask if there is any
additional deliberation or questions from the board. The chair, having
entertained such additional comment, if any, shall call for a vote at the
conclusion of the deliberation. (Ord. 408, 5-31-2001)

2-440: BONNER COUNTY DUST ABATEMENT POLICY:
   A.   Requirements: Prior to contractor being allowed to apply dust
suppressant in Bonner County:
      1.   A Bonner County dust abatement contractor's permit is required each
year by anyone applying a dust suppressant on Bonner County roads. It is
unlawful for any dust suppressant to be applied on county roads without a
permit.
      2.   Permit bond requirement: Ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
      3.   Liability insurance: Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00)
naming Bonner County as additional insured.
      4.   Materials certification: Submit current (not more than 30 days old)
certified test report and current MSDS (material safety data sheet) for
products proposed for dust abatement on county roads. (Products must meet the
requirements below.)
      5.   Current Idaho public works license.
      6.   Addresses of storage tanks owned by contractor.
      7.   Contractor must provide a legal, physical address for their office
or home for notification purposes.
      8.   Contractor must submit a copy of their claim process prior to
issuance of permit. (This process must be acceptable to the public works
director.)
   B.   Application Process: Process for applying dust suppressant on Bonner
County roads:
      1.   Each applicator shall contact and gain the approval of the Bonner
County public works department prior to applying any dust suppressant material
to public roadways.
      2.   Application for road grading shall be made by facsimile or e-mail
request from an approved contractor. Contractor shall provide the name,
physical address and telephone number of applicant, as well as dust suppressant
that will be used and application rate.
      3.   Contractor will be given a notice to proceed by facsimile or e-mail
when the road is ready for suppressant.
      4.   Contractor shall complete the application of dust suppressant within
one week of the notice to proceed, or sooner if the public works personnel
advise that the road should be treated within a shorter time period. Failure to
complete the treatment within the time specified may result in the county
regrading the area where the dust suppressant is applied. In this case, the
contractor will be obliged to reapply the suppressant at his/her expense, after
a new notice to proceed is issued. Under these circumstances, this location
will not be made a priority as crews will be grading other roads.
      5.   It shall be a violation of this section for any dust suppressant to
be applied, or to migrate, to a ditch or other drainage facility.
      6.   Asphalt emulsions shall be placed one lane at a time. The opposing
lane can be treated once the emulsion has "cured" to the extent that it does
not pick up on vehicles traveling ten (10) miles per hour or slower. The
contractor shall be responsible for any and all claims resulting from vehicle
damage due to not following this procedure.
      7.   The Bonner County public works department will issue permits for all
non-water soluble products used as dust suppressants if such application is
approved. The Bonner County public works department employees will fill out
these permits and a facsimile copy will be sent to the applicator. These
permits can be generated by phone without necessitating an office visit by the
resident. The application of these products without a permit is prohibited. If
these materials are applied to a county maintained roadway without a permit,
the roadway will be graded as soon as practicable.
      8.   No dust suppressant material shall be applied prior to final spring
grading and approval of the public works department. If this occurs, the public
works department will grade the section of road that was treated during normal
spring grading. It will be the homeowner's/applicator's responsibility to
reapply dust suppressant if grading damages the dust suppressant.
      9.   Bonner County assumes no liability or responsibility for damages due
to the application of dust suppressants.
      10.   Parties who contract for the application of asphalt emulsions or
lignosulfonates shall be responsible for the maintenance of the roadway that
has been treated. Potholes must be filled regularly, or within five (5) days of
a request from the public works department. If the potholes are not filled, the
roadway will be graded.
      11.   "Fresh Oil" or other appropriate signs that state the contractor's
name and phone number shall be required at each end of dust suppressant
application.
   C.   Materials:
      1.   Contractor shall provide a current certified test report of the
product proposed for use on county roads. Petroleum products, other than county
approved emulsified asphalt products, are no longer allowed on Bonner County
roads. Only products specifically labeled as "dust palliative", by the
manufacturer, will be approved for use in Bonner County. The manufacturer or
supplier must submit a letter to the county stating that the product is labeled
as a dust palliative and must also include instructions, recommendations and/or
guidelines for the application of such product as a dust suppressant. The
contractor must provide a current MSDS report on the material. Copies of the
MSDS shall be carried on the applicator truck and made available for inspection
by county personnel upon request.
      2.   The county will sporadically take samples of the dust suppressant
products. The contractor and operators shall cooperate with county personnel in
obtaining the samples from the distributing trucks. An MSDS must be provided at
the time the sample is obtained. If a truck is said to be empty, a county
employee must still be allowed to attempt to obtain a sample.
      3.   If a certified test report shows a significant variation from the
approved dust suppressant as determined by the public works director, the
contractor will no longer be allowed to apply dust suppressant in Bonner County
until quality control procedures are approved by Bonner County.
      4.   When the contractor changes products, a new certified test report
will be required. Failure to provide current information on a dust suppressant
shall result in the termination of contractor's permit.
   D.   Restrictions:
      1.   Petroleum based dust suppressant products, other than approved
asphalt emulsions, are no longer approved for use as a dust suppressant on
Bonner County roads. "Road oils" are no longer allowed in Bonner County.
      2.   Emulsified asphalt products will not be allowed near streams or in
watersheds where the product could migrate into lakes, streams, wetlands or
other water sources.
      3.   Calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or lignosulfonates may be used
in watershed areas. However, care must be taken in all cases and with all
products to ensure that no product is applied to groundwater or other water
sources, or to any area that is close enough to a water source that would allow
even the slightest migration to enter that water source.
      4.   If any product is misapplied within a watershed area, it will be the
contractor's responsibility to remove the product in the manner approved by the
Idaho department of environmental quality (IDEQ) at his/her own expense. If
IDEQ has to respond to a "spill", the contractor assumes full legal and
financial responsibility for the removal process and any fines related to the
misapplication.
   E.   Remediation: Where unauthorized dust suppressants are used, or where
dust suppressant is applied too heavily on hard surface, it may be necessary
for the county to take immediate corrective measures. If such measures are
deemed necessary by the public works director, the contractor shall pay for all
labor and materials involved in the remediation. The contractor shall not be
allowed to apply any dust suppressant within Bonner County until the bill is
paid in full.
   F.   Penalties:
      1.   There shall be a three hundred dollar ($300.00) penalty per incident
for any applicator violating any provision of this policy, in addition to any
expenses incurred in any corrective measures taken.
      2.   If a contractor violates any provision of this policy, the
contractor's permit shall be revoked until penalty and damages are paid.
      3.   A permit may be denied to any contractor who repeatedly or blatantly
violates the provisions of this policy.
   G.   Permit:
      1.   By his/her signature on the permit, the contractor agrees to follow
each provision of this policy.
      2.   The permit may be canceled at any time the public works director
determines any contractor has violated the provisions herein. (Ord. 409, 6-9-
2001)

This person shall be subject to the presumption set forth in subsection A1 of
this section, which may be rebutted as set forth in subsection A2 of this
section.
      4.   For purposes of this subsection, proof that a person is the
registered owner of a vehicle is not prima facie evidence that the registered
owner has violated any other provision of law.
   B.   Lessees And Renters:
      1.   In any prosecution against the lessee or renter of a motor vehicle
charging a violation of any regulation governing the standing or parking of a

violation of any provision of this chapter or regulation, together with proof
that the defendant named in the complaint was, at the time of parking, the
lessee or renter of the vehicle, shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
lessee or renter of the vehicle was the person who parked or placed the vehicle
at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred.
      2.   The presumption that the lessee or renter of the vehicle was the
person who parked or placed the vehicle at the time and place where the
violation occurred may be rebutted with evidence that the lessee or renter of
the vehicle was not the person who parked or placed the vehicle at the time and
place where the violation occurred.
      3.   For purposes of this subsection, proof that a person is the lessee
or renter of a vehicle is not prima facie evidence that the lessee or renter
has violated any other provision of this law. (Ord. 542, 12-23-2014)
2-490: PENALTIES:
Any person found in violation of section
2-401 or

pledgor at the time of redemption a written signed receipt indicating the exact

inches (12") below the ceiling. The detector may be battery powered or may be
connected to an electrical outlet box by a permanent wiring method into a
general electrical branch circuit, without any switch between the over current
protection device protecting the branch circuit and the detector.
      2.   The walls, ceilings and doors of each compartment containing a gas
fired furnace or water heater shall be lined with five-sixteenths inch (5/16")
gypsum board, unless the door opens to the exterior of the home, in which case,
the door may be all metal construction. All exterior compartments shall seal to
the interior of the mobile home.
      3.   Each room designated expressly for sleeping purposes shall have an
exterior exit door or at least one outside egress window or other approved exit
device with a minimum clear dimension of twenty two inches (22") and a minimum
clear opening of five (5) square feet. The bottom of the exit shall not be more
than thirty six inches (36") above the floor.

pressure not less than the working pressure under which it is to be used. The
water used for tests shall be obtained from a potable source of supply. A fifty
(50) pound per square inch (344.5 kPa) air pressure may be substituted for the
water test. In either method of test, the piping shall withstand a test without
leaking for a period of not less than fifteen (15) minutes.
         b.   A water test shall be applied to the drainage and vent system
either in its entirety or in sections. If applied to the entire system, all
openings in the piping shall be tightly closed, except at the highest opening,
and the system filled with water to the point of overflow. If the system is
tested in sections, each opening shall be tightly plugged except the highest
opening of the section under the test and each section shall be filled with
water, but no section shall be tested with less than a ten foot (10') (3 m)
head of water. In testing successive sections, at least the upper ten feet
(10') (3 m) of the next preceding section shall be tested, so that no joint or
pipe in the structure, except the uppermost ten feet (10') (3 m) of the system,
shall have been submitted to a test of less than a ten foot (10') (3 m) head of
water. The water shall be kept in the system or in the portion under testing
for at least fifteen (15) minutes before inspection starts. The system shall be

SUBCHAPTER 2.4 - SPECIAL USE PERMITS
12-240: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this subchapter is to include provisions for special uses,
events and structures that are temporary in nature, but otherwise prohibited
due to their intensive nature; provided, that these uses are carried out with
safeguards to ensure their compatibility with the surrounding uses. (Ord. 501,
11-18-2008)
12-241: APPLICABILITY:
The provisions of this subchapter are applicable to all uses, events and
structures of a temporary nature that would otherwise be prohibited under the
terms of the zoning, subdivision and other land use regulations, adopted and in
force in Bonner County, Idaho, except that the provisions of this subchapter do
not apply to:
   A.   Any event at which fewer than four hundred (400) persons are in
attendance or are expected to attend at a single location.
   B.   Uses of land, events and structures which are a part of, or customarily
accessory to, a permitted use or conditional use.
   C.   Events and temporary uses which occur entirely within an existing
structure.
   D.   Structures which are of a temporary nature and associated with the
construction of a permitted use or conditional use. (See also section
12-420 of this title for temporary structures.)
   E.   Uses, events and structures located entirely on lands owned or
controlled by the United States or the State of Idaho. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-242: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Special uses are uses of a temporary nature that would otherwise be
prohibited uses. By their nature, special uses are significantly more intensive
than the permitted uses or conditional uses in the respective zone districts,
but temporary special uses may be carried out with particular safeguards to
ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses and without endangering public
health and safety. Temporary special uses are therefore subject to additional
restrictions, requirements and conditions more stringent than those applying
generally within the zone district.
   B.   Once a special use permit has been approved, the terms and conditions
of that permit shall not be changed, except as set forth at section
12-266 of this chapter.
   C.   Any development or use in violation of the terms and conditions of the
special use permit shall be deemed a violation of this title. (Ord. 501, 11-18-
2008)
12-243: DURATION OF PERMIT:
   A.   Special use permits issued under the terms of this chapter shall be
valid for a period specified in the permit, and in the discretion of the Board,
may include site preparation and cleanup or restoration after the event
concludes, the use is discontinued or the structure is removed. On petition by
the permittee, the Board may allow one extension of time for the completion of
the terms of the special use permit. Special use permits shall be deemed to run
with the land to which they are attached, and the terms of these permits shall
not be modified, abrogated or abridged by a change in ownership of the lands,
or other private contracts or agreements. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
   B.   A special use permit shall be issued for a single event, use or
structure, or a combination, for a specific period and shall not be renewable
for annual or repeated events, uses or structures, with the following
exceptions:
      1.   Fun runs, cycling events, triathlons, or other similar recreational
and community events may be renewable provided:
         a.   The repeat event is located on the same site.
         b.   The applicant has been issued a special use permit or renewal
within the previous two (2) years.
         c.   There have been no violations of previous permits.
         d.   The applicant submits a renewal application and pays the fee set
forth by the official fee schedule.
         e.   The number of renewals for a repeat event shall not exceed five
(5).
         f.   The number of attendees or expected attendees does not exceed the
original permitted number.
      2.   The Planning Director is authorized to issue the renewal and apply
the conditions of the original permit and other conditions reasonably related
to the conditions of section
12-246 of this subchapter. (Ord. 539, 8-20-2014)
12-244: APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USE PERMIT:
Applications for special use permits shall be made on forms supplied by the
Planning Director and shall include:
   A.   The name of the applicant responsible for conducting the special use
and responsible for compliance with the terms and conditions of the special use
permit. If the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, written and
notarized evidence of the permission of the owner to conduct the proposed
special use shall accompany the application.
   B.   A description of the proposed use, including the type of activity,
hours of operation, number of vehicle trips anticipated, duration of the
activity (including site preparation and site restoration or cleanup), size of
structures or nature of structures to be built, and any management or
operations planned to minimize effects of the activity on surrounding
properties.
   C.   A vicinity map depicting the site and the surrounding area, including
all pertinent features such as roads, public facilities, bodies of water and
current land uses.
   D.   A site plan showing the property boundaries, general topography,
building layout, access, parking and any other details that clearly depict the
proposed use.
   E.   The names and addresses of owners of properties located within three
hundred feet (300') of the proposed special use as shown in the records of the
Assessor's Office. If the proposed special use is a part of a larger parcel of
land under the same ownership, the names and addresses of owners of properties
adjoining the larger parcel shall also be included.
   F.   An application fee as set forth at section
12-265 of this chapter. The Board may waive the fee for political subdivisions
or public agencies. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-245: STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
The board shall examine all applications for special use permits for compliance
with the following standards:
   A.   The type of temporary use proposed, its general location and the
characteristics of the specific site are compatible with the nature of the
district and will not have material and long term negative effects.
   B.   There is sufficient land area to accommodate the proposed special use,
and that the temporary use and any appurtenant structures are arranged on the
land to minimize any adverse effects on surrounding properties, and will not
create particular hazards to adjacent properties.
   C.   The design and management of the proposed special use will not pose a
material risk to public health and safety.
   D.   Adequate public services (such as water supply, sewage disposal
facilities, roads, law enforcement, traffic control, fire protection, emergency
medical services, etc.) exist or will be provided to serve the proposed special
use.
   E.   The site plan and accompanying descriptive material for the special use
are sufficiently detailed to provide a clear and unambiguous description of the
nature of the use to be allowed under the terms of the special use permit.
   F.   Measures can and will be taken to mitigate any adverse effects that the
proposed special use may have. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)

this section for examples and
requirements. Improvements required to
mitigate impacts shall not be used to
earn bonus lots.
5. Bonus for urban sewer (where not
required to achieve given density)      25 percent
(i.e.,suburban using "urban sewer" to
get to smaller acres).
 
   E.   Public Amenities: Below are public amenities that can be provided to
obtain a density bonus. All are subject to approval by the board:
      1.   Construct recreational improvements that are available for the use
by the general public. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, play
fields, picnic shelters, children play areas and indoor recreational
facilities. Applicants must successfully demonstrate that the improvements are
safe, accessible and desirable to the general public.
      2.   Construct public facilities such as schools, fire stations or
libraries. To qualify, the land and/or facilities must be accepted by the
applicable public agency. The land itself set aside for such public use shall
be considered as common open space for the purposes of obtaining a density
bonus.
      3.   Pave roadways (where they are not required to be paved).
      4.   Provide environmental improvements as certified by wetlands, plant
or other biologists having expert knowledge of the specific environmental
feature. An example could be replacement of nonnative vegetation with native
vegetation in common open space areas. Such improvements are particularly
desirable in and around wetland areas and designated critical wildlife habitat.
      5.   Provide off site road improvements (above and beyond what is
required by board for subdivision approval).
The applicant shall include a cost estimate for the proposed public amenity
improvements prepared by a professional construction estimator, registered
general contractor, engineer, architect or landscape architect shall be

proposed public amenity must meet the following requirements:
      1.   Applicants must successfully demonstrate how the improvements
benefit the public.
      2.   The percentage of density bonus shall be commensurate with the cost
of the applicable improvements per the following scale:
Cost of proposed improvements = $Y
Density bonus = Extra lot or lots* valued at the equivalent of two (2) times
the cost of proposed improvements (2 x Y) up to a maximum density bonus of
twenty five percent (25%).
*The average value of lots in the proposed subdivision as determined by a state
licensed appraiser at the time the application is submitted. The appraised
value shall take into account the average size of proposed lots, proposed
physical improvements (including proposed amenities), and locational
attributes.
For example, if the applicant proposes off site road improvements costing an
estimated fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the applicant is then eligible
for a bonus lot or lots equaling up to one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) in assessed value. If a state licensed appraiser concludes that
the average market value for one of the proposed cluster lots is fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000.00), then the applicant qualifies for up to two (2) additional
lots (provided the extra lots do not exceed 25 percent of the total density of
the subdivision).

the standards. PUD subdivisions shall comply with the conservation subdivision
provisions of section
12-633 of this title.
   H.   Buffering, Clustering: Residential PUDs shall provide for the
clustering of dwelling units. Clustered lots shall be accessed by interior road

shall be designed to provide at a minimum one of the following:
      1.   Cluster lots that abut surrounding properties or right of way shall
be at least seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum lot size standard for the
subject parcel.
      2.   Cluster lots that abut surrounding properties or rights of way shall
be separated from adjacent properties or rights of way by a minimum buffer
strip of one hundred feet (100'). At a minimum, proposed or existing
landscaping and vegetation within the buffer strip shall be of sufficient size
and type to provide a buffer of vegetation six feet (6') in height and fifty
percent (50%) opaque year round within three (3) years of planting. New
landscaping materials shall consist of a combination of native trees and
shrubs, as provided in
appendix B of this title. Variations to these standards may be permitted where
the applicant can demonstrate that unique topographic conditions provide
sufficient buffering, such as intervening waterways, ridges or ravines, or
other land features. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008; amd. Ord. 512, 1-6-2010; Ord. 661,

(Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-321: FORESTRY DISTRICT:
   A.   The forestry district is established to preserve the forest land base;
to conserve and protect the long term productivity of forest lands; and to
restrict uses unrelated to or incompatible with forestry. These purposes are
accomplished by:
      1.   Applying the F zone to large contiguous areas where a combination of
site, soil and climatic characteristics make it possible to sustain timber
growth and harvests over time.
      2.   Limiting residential, recreational, commercial and industrial uses
to those uses that are compatible with forestry, to minimize the potential
hazards of damage from fire, pollution and land use conflicts.
      3.   Providing for compatible outdoor recreation uses and for
conservation and protection of municipal watersheds and fish and wildlife
habitats.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated as remote ag/forest
land in the comprehensive plan. The remote agricultural/forest land is located
on mountaintops and remote areas of the county where few or no access roads
have been constructed. Included in these areas are most of the state and
federal lands, which are managed for forest production or recreation. (Ord.
501, 11-18-2008)
12-322: AGRICULTURAL/FORESTRY DISTRICT:
   A.   The agricultural/forestry district is established to provide for
agricultural and forestry pursuits, including livestock production, forestry,
horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, and necessary accessory uses for
treating, storing and processing agricultural products. The purpose of the A/
F district is to preserve, protect and maintain areas that are rural in
character and the integrity of the forest/woodland areas where viable
agricultural pursuits can be feasible and to avoid fragmentation of forests and
farms. These purposes are accomplished by:
      1.   Establishing residential density limits and conservation development
standards to retain areas sized for efficient farming.
      2.   Allowing for uses related to agricultural production and limiting
nonagricultural uses to those compatible with agriculture, or requiring close
proximity for the support of agriculture.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated by the
comprehensive plan as follows:
      1.   A/F-20 in all areas designated as prime ag/forest land in the
comprehensive plan. The A/F-20 zone is also appropriate in areas designated ag/
forest land in the comprehensive plan that also feature:
         a.   Prime agricultural soils.
         b.   Are characterized by agricultural or forestry uses.
         c.   Areas where one or more of the following apply: limited services;
characterized by slopes steeper than thirty percent (30%); where access may be
absent or limited to substandard road systems or where large tracts of land may
be devoted to ag/forest production.
      2.   A/F-10 in areas designated as ag/forest land in the comprehensive
plan that do not feature prime agricultural soils, but where agricultural and
forestry pursuits remain viable. These areas may be within or adjacent to areas
of city impact or where lands are afforded fire protection, access to standard
roads and other services. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-323: RURAL DISTRICT:
   A.   The rural district is established to allow low density residential uses
that are compatible with rural pursuits. The purpose can be accomplished by:
      1.   Limiting residential densities and permitted uses to those that are
compatible with rural character and nearby resource production districts and
sites and can be adequately supported by rural service levels.
      2.   Allowing small scale farming and forestry activities, and tourism
and recreation uses that can be supported by rural service levels and are
compatible with rural character.
      3.   Encouraging conservation development configurations that create
permanent open space or farming areas, protect sensitive environmental
features, reduce infrastructure costs and/or enhance recreational
opportunities.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated by the
comprehensive plan as follows:
      1.   R-10 in areas designated as rural residential in the comprehensive
plan that meet one or more of the following criteria:
         a.   Characterized by slopes that are steeper than thirty percent
(30%).
         b.   Located within critical wildlife habitat as identified by
federal, state or local agencies.
         c.   Contain prime agricultural soils.
         d.   Served by a network of public and/or private roadways that
generally do not meet applicable roadway standards set forth in title 2 (public
roads) of this code or
appendix A (private roads) of this title or are absent.
         e.   Within the floodway.
         f.   Contain limited access to public services.
      2.   R-5 in areas designated rural residential in the comprehensive plan
that are already developed at or near the one dwelling unit per five (5) acre
density and/or do not meet the criteria for R-10 above. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-324: SUBURBAN DISTRICT:
   A.   The suburban district is established to promote the development of
residential uses located on the edges of the incorporated cities or other
developed communities or areas, where urban sewer and water services are either
available or have the potential to become available in the near future by
reason of their inclusion in service districts, city service areas, or are
adjacent to those areas or areas of city impact. Access to primary
transportation routes and a system of hard surfaced roads are expected. The
purpose can be accomplished by:
      1.   Providing for single-family detached dwelling units and other
compatible housing forms, with a variety of densities in locations appropriate
for urban densities.
      2.   Allowing only those accessory and complementary nonresidential uses
that are compatible with urban residential communities.
      3.   Establishing density designations to facilitate advanced areawide
planning for public facilities and services, and to protect environmentally
sensitive sites from over development.
      4.   Encouraging conservation development configurations that create
permanent open space, protect sensitive environmental features, reduce
infrastructure costs and/or enhance recreational opportunities.
      5.   Requiring conservation development configurations in areas where all
urban services are not available to provide the opportunity in the future to
subdivide the land at urban densities.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated by the
comprehensive plan as transition, urban growth area, resort community or
suburban growth area in the comprehensive plan where a network of hard surfaced
roads provides good access to primary transportation routes or potential public
transportation systems. Urban services may not be available immediately, but
are capable of being extended or constructed in the area. (Ord. 501, 11-18-
2008)
12-325: COMMERCIAL DISTRICT:
   A.   The commercial district is established to promote a range of commercial
uses to serve the needs of the immediate area, surrounding rural communities
and visitors without adversely affecting adjacent residential neighborhoods.
The commercial district is also intended to provide opportunities for a variety
of affordable housing types that are within walking distance of commercial
services. Intensive large scale commercial development is not appropriate due
to the limited density of surrounding unincorporated areas. Access to primary
transportation routes and a system of hard surfaced roads are expected and
consideration is given to the potential public transportation access. These
purposes are accomplished by:
      1.   Providing for a wide range of small to medium scaled retail,
professional, governmental and personal service uses.
      2.   Allowing for mixed use buildings (housing over office or retail) and
a range of housing types, including cottage housing, townhouses, apartments and
mobile home parks where sufficient services are provided.
      3.   Allowing for light industrial uses where activities are conducted
primarily indoors and impacts to adjacent uses can be mitigated.
      4.   Excluding commercial uses with extensive outdoor storage.
      5.   Excluding large scale commercial uses that would be more effectively
located in incorporated cities.
      6.   Applying simple design standards that enhance pedestrian access and
improve the character of the area.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated as neighborhood
commercial, urban growth area or transition by the comprehensive plan and
community plans and that are served at the time of development by adequate
sewage disposal services, water supply, roads and other needed public
facilities and services. Expansion of existing commercial districts or the
creation of new commercial districts may be considered only if the expansion
will not negatively impact the safety and function of a state highway or other
roadway. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-326: INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT:
   A.   The industrial district is established to promote the development of
areas for manufacturing, processing, fabrication and wholesale sales, research
and testing operations, limited retail sales and warehousing. It is also a
purpose of this zone to protect the industrial land base for industrial
economic development and employment opportunities. Due to the intensity of land
use, these areas require primary transportation routes, urbanlike water and
sewer services, fire and police services and consideration given to the
potential public transportation access. These purposes are accomplished by:
      1.   Providing for a wide range of industrial and manufacturing uses.
      2.   Establishing appropriate development standards and public review
procedures for industrial activities with the greatest potential for adverse
impacts.
      3.   Limiting residential, institutional, office and other nonindustrial
uses to those that are accessory to industrial activities.
      4.   Allowing limited commercial uses that complement industrial
activities.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated by the
comprehensive plan as transition which are served at the time of development by
adequate sewage disposal services, water supply, roads and other needed public
facilities and services. Expansion of existing industrial districts or the
creation of new industrial districts may be considered only if the expansion
will not negatively impact the safety and function of a state highway or other
roadway. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
   C.   The Planning or Zoning Commission and board of county commissioners may
add specific conditions to require compatibility with surrounding uses and to
assure compliance with the intent of the industrial district, this title, and
the health and safety of the public. To assure conditions are met, the county
shall require the execution of a written commitment concerning the use or
development of the subject parcel. This commitment shall be recorded in the
office of the county recorder. The commitment shall take effect on the adoption
of the amendment to the zoning map. The commitment shall be binding on the
owner of the parcel, each subsequent owner, and each person acquiring an
interest in the parcel. A commitment may be modified following the procedures
for modification provided within this title and the approval of the board. The
commitment may be terminated and the zoning designation reversed on the failure
of the landowner/operator to abide by the terms of the agreement, following
notice to the landowner/operator by certified mail of the violations and after
a reasonable time, as determined by the governing board, has been given to
abate the violation. No such reversal of zoning may occur without appropriate
notice and public hearing as set forth in Idaho Code and this code for zoning
district amendments and proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a violation
remains after attempts to abate have been exhausted. If the board reverses the
zoning designation after a hearing, the board decision shall be final and
further recourse shall be as provided by Idaho Code. (Ord. 551, 3-9-2016; amd.
Ord. 661, 3-18-2022; Ord. 580, 10-12-2022)
12-327: RURAL SERVICE CENTER DISTRICT:
   A.   The rural service center district is established to promote the
development of local commercial services in small communities to meet the needs
of rural residents as well as limited tourist commercial services and limited
light industrial uses consistent with the maintenance of the rural character of
the area. The rural service center district is also intended to provide
opportunities for a variety of affordable housing types that are within walking
distance of commercial services. These purposes are accomplished by:
      1.   Providing for a range of small scale retail and rural service uses.
      2.   Allowing for mixed use buildings (housing over office or retail) and
a range of housing types, including detached single-family dwelling units,
cottage housing, townhouses, apartments and mobile home parks where sufficient
services are provided.
      3.   Allowing for light industrial uses where activities are conducted
primarily indoors and impacts to adjacent uses are mitigated.
      4.   Excluding commercial uses with extensive outdoor storage.
      5.   Excluding large scale commercial uses that would be more effectively
located in incorporated cities.
      6.   Applying simple design standards that enhance pedestrian access and
improve the character of the area. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated as neighborhood
commercial, resort community or transition by the comprehensive plan and
community plans and that are served at the time of development by adequate
sewage disposal services, water supply, roads and other needed public
facilities and services. Expansion of existing rural service center districts
or the creation of new rural service center districts may be considered only if
the expansion will not negatively impact the safety and function of a state
highway or other roadway. (Ord. 512, 1-6-2010)
12-328: RECREATION DISTRICT:
   A.   The recreation district is established to provide a wide range of
recreational uses in areas where if access is by road rather than solely by
waterways, the road shall be located within a recorded easement or public right
of way, except where subject to the terms of an approved special use permit or
a state or federal agency, adequate water and sewer services and fire services.
Consideration shall also be given to access to potential public transportation
systems. The recreation district is intended to provide for a range of housing
types and uses that are accessory and complementary to recreational and
residential uses. These purposes are accomplished by:
      1.   Allowing for a range of housing types provided adequate services are
available.
      2.   Providing for commercial and private resorts which contain
provisions for a range of recreational activities.
      3.   Excluding uses that are not compatible with the desired recreational
character of the area.
      4.   Encouraging conservation development configurations that create
permanent open space, protect sensitive environmental features, reduce
infrastructure costs and/or enhance recreational opportunities.
      5.   Applying simple design standards that enhance the recreational
opportunities and character of the area.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated as transition,
neighborhood commercial, urban growth area and resort community with the
following conditions:
      1.   Land is physically suitable to accommodate a broad range of
residential and recreational uses.
      2.   Sites are served by adequate sewage disposal service, water supply,
roads and other needed public facilities and services. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-329: ALPINE VILLAGE DISTRICT:
   A.   The Alpine Village District is established to accommodate recreational
development in high elevation communities while recognizing the unique and
challenging features of mountain communities. The Alpine Village District is
intended to provide for a range of housing types and uses that are accessory
and complementary to recreational and residential uses. These purposes are
accomplished by:
      1.   Allowing for a range of housing types.
      2.   Providing for commercial and private resorts which include a range
of recreational activities.
      3.   Excluding uses that are not compatible with the desired
recreational/residential character of the area.
      4.   Applying development standards that address the unique environmental
needs of high elevation communities.
   B.   Use of this zone is appropriate in areas designated as alpine community
by the comprehensive plan. These are areas of the County generally greater than
three thousand feet (3,000') in elevation that support and complement mountain
recreational activities. Consideration within this district should also be
given to potential public and community transportation systems. (Ord. 501, 11-
18-2008)

adversely affect the residential development of the existing neighborhood. The
cemetery shall be provided with perpetual care for maintenance of the grounds
and landscaping.
   (5)    Sufficient land area is required to accommodate the proposed use, and
the use and any appurtenant structures shall be so arranged on the land as to
minimize any adverse effects on surrounding properties. The use shall not
create particular hazards to adjacent properties.
   (6)    Specified conditions with respect to emissions of noise, light,
glare, smoke, odor, dust, particulate matter, vibrations or hours of operation
may be prescribed differently from those required in a given district, as to be
compatible with other applicable State and Federal standards.
   (7)    A traffic plan is required describing, at minimum, the method of
ingress and egress to the site, traffic circulation within the site, and on
premises parking and loading/launching areas.
   (8)    The granting of approval of a heliport shall be based on the design
of the unit, which will meet all local, State and Federal requirements for such
use, and will be subject to the approval of the Federal Aviation
Administration. Heliports will be located in areas where effects from the
noise, vibration, dust or light will not adversely affect adjoining properties,
and where the safety of adjoining residents and the public is not endangered.
Storage of fuel will meet all local, State and Federal Fire Codes. No flammable
liquids, fuel, gases or other combustible materials will be stored below the
surface of any lake, river, stream or water body.

   (11)    The area of land covered by buildings shall not exceed 35 percent of
the total lot area. The site area shall be sufficient to accommodate the
facility and required parking, setbacks, landscaping, walkways and other
applicable development standards. The public utility facility lot or parcel is
not required to meet the minimum lot/parcel size of the zoning district in
which it is located. In considering applications, the Planning or Zoning
Commission shall consider the public convenience and necessity of the facility
and any adverse effect that the facility will have upon properties in the
vicinity, and may require such reasonable restrictions, or conditions of
development; or protective improvements as to uphold the purpose and intent of
this title and the comprehensive plan. A sewage management agreement shall be
approved and executed prior to the issuance of a conditional use permit for
subsurface sewage disposal systems serving 10 or more residential dwelling
units or designed with a capacity of 2,500 gallons or more per day.
   (12)    The site will provide for adequate screening from adjacent sensitive

(Ord. 577, 5-23-2018)
12-339: CLASSIFICATION OF NEW USES WITHIN ZONE DISTRICTS:
It is recognized that new unanticipated types of land uses will be proposed in
Bonner County. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, when a
use is proposed that is not listed as a prohibited, permitted or conditional
use in a zone district, the Planning Director shall make a determination that:
   A.   The use falls within the same standard classification pursuant to the
"Standard Industrial Classification Manual" or the North American Industry
Classification System, as amended, modified or superseded, as a listed
permitted or conditional use in a current zone district and that it may be
processed in the same fashion as the listed use; or
   B.   The use does not fall within the same standard classification pursuant
to the "Standard Industrial Classification Manual" or the North American
Industry Classification System, as amended, modified or superseded, as a listed
permitted or conditional use in a particular zone district, and thus is a
prohibited use in that district; or
   C.   The use is unique in nature and an amendment to this title is necessary
in order to allow for its placement within the appropriate zone district. (Ord.
577, 5-23-2018)
SUBCHAPTER 3.4 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
12-340: INTENT:
Within the district or zone established by this title or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist:
   A.   Lots;
   B.   Structures;
   C.   Uses of land and structures; and
   D.   Characteristics of uses which were lawful before this title was passed
or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this title or future amendment. It is the intent of this title to
permit these nonconformities to continue as required by law. It is further the
intent of this title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded
or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district or zone. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-341: GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
   A.   Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, a nonconforming use or
structure may be continued but may not be extended or altered, unless necessary
to comply with a lawful requirement and unless the use or structure is a less
intensive use than the permitted uses in the zone (such as a residence in a
conforming residential zone which has been rezoned to industrial). Exceptions:
      1.   The accumulated expansion by up to ten percent (10%) of a
commercial, industrial or public use, set forth in BCRC
12-333 and
table 3-3,
12-334 and
table 3-4,
12-335 and
table 3-5, or structure in any zoning district that was established prior to
November 18, 2008, and that has been in use continuously since November 18,
2008, is permitted, provided no additional land area is being acquired for the
expansion.
      2.   The accumulated expansion of such use identified in subsection A1 of
this section by more than ten percent (10%), but no more than fifty percent
(50%) is conditionally permitted, provided no additional land area is being
acquired for the expansion.
      3.   For natural material resource-based uses, operating under an
approved Idaho Department of Lands Reclamation plan, and set forth in BCRC
12-336 and
table 3-6, nonconforming uses may be expanded within the parcel boundaries
existing at/on November 18, 2008. For the complete development of the material
resources of the State or any other necessary means to their complete
development, or any other use necessary to the complete development of the
material resources of the State.
   B.   The extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a structure for
which a building location permit or building permit or zoning permit has been
granted at the time of passage of this chapter shall not be deemed an
enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming structure
which conforms with respect to use may be altered or expanded if the alteration
or expansion does not cause the structure to deviate further from the standards
of this title.
   C.   If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of two (2) years or
more, further use of the property shall conform to this title. For "surface
mines", as defined in section
12-813 of this title, it shall be concluded that the operator has permanently
ceased surface mining operations as to a given affected land if no "minerals",
as defined in section
12-813 of this title, have been removed from the mine in question for a period
of three (3) years or more. Discontinued nonconforming uses are also governed
by the standards of Idaho Code section 67-6538, as it may be amended or
retitled from time to time. If a nonconforming use has been discontinued for
two (2) or more years, the County may require a written declaration of intent
from the landowner, pursuant to the provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6538.
   D.   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall require any change in the
plans, construction, alteration or designated use of a structure for which a
building location permit or building permit has been issued by the county prior
to the adoption of this section, provided the structure has been completed and
in use within two (2) years from the time the permit is issued. (Ord. 501, 11-
18-2008; amd. Ord. 524, 1-11-2012; Ord. 672, 3-18-2022)
12-342: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
   A.   The minimum site area requirements will apply in all districts, except
that these regulations shall not prohibit permitted uses on a lot of record
(i.e., lots divided prior to the date of this section). All structures will
meet minimum setback requirements as provided in this title.
   B.   In any district or zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on
any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
section, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this title.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district or
zone; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying
to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district or zone in which such lot is located. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
   C.   Any conforming or legally nonconforming parcel or lot reduced or
further reduced in size below the zoning district minimums by a government
action for the purpose of acquiring public rights of way shall be considered
legally nonconforming. (Ord. 524, 1-11-2012)
12-343: NONCONFORMING USES OF LANDS:
Nonconforming uses of land may be continued so long as they remain otherwise
lawful, provided:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this section, except where otherwise noted in this
subchapter.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this section. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-344: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason
of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot,
or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way
which increases its nonconformity. Any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   B.   A nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure
destroyed by any means may be reconstructed so long as the reconstruction does
not increase its nonconformity and reconstruction occurs within two (2) years
of its destruction.
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district or
zone in which it is located after it is moved.
   D.   No nonconforming portion of a structure may be enlarged or altered in
any way which increases its bulk (such as lot area, open space, yards, lot
coverage, height, impervious surface ratios and floor area ratios). (Ord. 501,
11-18-2008)
12-345: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN COMBINATION:
If a lawful use involving individual structures exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this title that would not be allowed in the district
or zone under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in
the district or zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district or zone in which it
is located.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time
of adoption or amendment of this section, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and premises may be considered by the Zoning Commission
for a change to another nonconforming use through the conditional use permit
process provided by this title, provided the Zoning Commission shall find that
the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district or
zone than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Zoning
Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this title.
   D.   Any existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in
the district or zone in which it is located that is superseded by a permitted
use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district or zone, and
the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   E.   When an existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title
in the district or zone in which it is located fails to be used for the
nonconforming use for two (2) years (except where government action impedes
access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district or zone in which it is located.
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction", for the purpose of this
subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the replacement value at time of destruction.
   G.   Any nonconforming use or structure and use in combination that is
damaged or destroyed by an involuntary event such as fire, explosion, collapse
or similar catastrophe may be repaired or reconstructed and the nonconforming
use restored, provided the following conditions are met:
      1.   A building permit or building location permit has been issued,
reconstruction has commenced and the use has resumed within two (2) years of
the qualifying event.
      2.   The nonconformity shall not be enlarged, increased or intensified.

SUBCHAPTER 4.1 - DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
12-410: INTERPRETATION OF TABLES:
   A.   Sections
12-411 and
12-412 of this chapter contain general density and dimension standards for the
various zones and limitations specific to a particular zone. The minimum
setbacks shall apply to all structures, as defined in section
12-819 of this title, except as otherwise noted. Additional rules, exceptions
and methodologies are set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   B.   The density and dimension tables are arranged in a matrix format on two
(2) separate tables and are delineated into two (2) zoning district groupings
for ease of use:
      1.   Forestry, agricultural/forestry, rural.
      2.   Suburban, commercial, industrial, rural service center, recreation,
alpine village.
   C.   Development standards are listed down the left side of both matrices,
and the zones are listed at the top. The matrix cells contain the minimum
dimensional requirements of the zone. A blank box indicates that there are no
specific requirements related to the applicable standard. Specific requirements
or exceptions associated with particular standards are identified by numbers in
parentheses. Such requirements or exceptions are listed below the table.
Requirements or exceptions listed in the "standard" column (far left column in
each table) shall apply to the standard in each zoning district referenced in
the table. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)

Requirements Or Exceptions:
   (1)   Building lots in conservation subdivisions can be smaller than the
minimum lot size for each zone. See chapter 6,
subchapter 6.3 of this title for more details.
   (2)   For the purposes of subdividing or adjusting lots or parcel lines:
Gross acreage may include rights of way within the boundaries of the land being
subdivided or where right of way has been dedicated within the subject aliquot
division of a section of land. Acreages may be rounded off per the following:
4.95 acres and larger shall be considered 5 acres; 9.95 acres and larger shall
be considered 10 acres; 19.95 acres and larger shall be considered 20 acres;
39.95 acres and larger shall be considered 40 acres.
   (3)   Density may be increased via conservation subdivision provisions set
forth in section
12-637 of this title for properties in the A/F and R zones.
   (4)   Or 1/16 aliquot division of the section minimum site area.
   (5)   Or 1/32 aliquot division of the section minimum site area.

   (7)   Or 1/128 aliquot division of the section minimum site area.
   (8)   Dwellings, not to exceed a total of 3 single family dwellings, may be
permitted on a single lot or parcel of land; providing, that the lot or parcel
is large enough to comply with the density requirements of the zone. The
maximum density of dwellings on a single lot or parcel of land shall be
calculated using only non-submerged land. For example, 3 single family
dwellings may be permitted on a 15 acre lot or parcel in the Rural 5 (R-5)
district. Exceptions:
      a.   The total allowable number of dwellings does not apply to temporary
or seasonal farm labor housing, such as a bunkhouse where only sleeping
quarters are provided for farmworkers.
      b.   Additional single family dwellings may be allowed on lot in a
conservation subdivision or PUD, provided the subdivision or development plan
complies with the density requirements of the district and where the single
family dwellings are authorized on the plat, if applicable.

exceptions may be applied, provided snow storage and stormwater are
accommodated on the subject site:
      a.   The minimum property line setback may be reduced to 5 feet for lots/
parcels of less than one (1) acre.
      b.   The minimum property line setback may be reduced to 10 feet for
lots/parcels larger than 1 acre but less than 5 acres.
   (12)   Setback requirements per this subchapter do not exempt land owners
from deeded restrictions or confirm landowners are not building in recorded or
prescriptive ingress/egress boundaries. Nothing in this Title shall be
construed to relieve an applicant from complying with deeded restrictions,
prescriptive easements or legally binding easement boundaries.
   (13)   The minimum property line setbacks for agricultural buildings and
other nonresidential structures shall be at least 40 feet, the minimum setback
requirements may be reduced to 50 percent of the requirement if acceptable
landscaping or screening, approved by the planning director, is provided. Such
screening shall be masonry or solid fence between 4 feet and 8 feet in height,

utility purposes not connected with general conduct of business for which
office or sales space is provided.
   B.   Off street parking areas shall contain the minimum number of parking
spaces stipulated in
table 4-3 following, plus adequate stopping or parking areas for service
vehicles, as specified in subsection C of this section. Standards associated
with a particular use are identified by numbers in parentheses. Standards are
listed below the table. A use that is similar to any of the below referenced
uses shall adhere to the minimum parking requirements for the referenced use or
uses. The planning director shall determine the minimum parking requirements
for service vehicles and for a use that is not referenced in this section based
on the most comparable use pursuant to the "Standard Industrial Classification

industrial where commercial uses and services are proposed, and rural service
center districts and all other commercial, multi-family, public and industrial
development in other zoning districts unless otherwise noted. (Ord. 512, 1-6-
2010)
12-452: SITE AND BUILDING PLANS:
The applicant shall submit site and building plans through the applicable
permit process detailed as necessary to demonstrate how the standards in
section
12-453 of this chapter have been met. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-453: STANDARDS:
   A.   Sidewalk/Pathway Standards: Provide a sidewalk or pathway paralleling
or nearly paralleling the street along the front edge of the property for all
new developments and any building addition where the value of the addition
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the existing
structure and/or site improvements as determined by the Bonner County
assessor's office over any five (5) year time period. The sidewalk/pathway may
be built within the public right of way (where authorized by the applicable
agency) or on private property and shall be at least six feet (6') in width
(except where greater widths are specifically set forth in the Bonner County
trails plan). Where the sidewalk/pathway is provided on private property, an
easement at least fifteen feet (15') in width allowing for public access is
encouraged. For subdivisions in applicable zoning districts, the easement shall
be noted on the plat, and the sidewalk/pathway constructed prior to final plat
approval. The sidewalk/pathway shall be constructed with an all weather surface
per specifications in the Bonner County trails plan or as approved by the
planning director. The planning director may grant an exception to the above
requirement if the following criteria are met, as determined by the planning
director:
      1.   Adjacent property or properties along the applicable street frontage
are not zoned for commercial uses.
      2.   For sites with multiple buildings fronting the street, a pathway
along the street linking the two (2) buildings shall be required, but trail
connections to the adjacent properties will not be required where subsection A1
of this section is applicable.
      3.   Sites at the end of dead end road where pedestrian connections
beyond the road are not possible or desirable.
For all exceptions above, except subsection A3 of this section, the development
shall be positioned in a way that allows for trail construction along the front
edge of the property (or within the right of way adjacent to the front property
line) in the future.
   B.   Pedestrian Connections: Provide walkways connecting all on site
commercial and multi-family buildings with each other and the street for all
new developments and any building additions where the value of the additions
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the existing
structure and/or site improvements as determined by the Bonner County
assessor's office over any five (5) year time period. For other additions or
improvements, pathways shall be provided to connect any new structures with
existing structures, as determined by the planning director. Buildings/uses
where little or no pedestrian traffic is anticipated may be exempted from this
requirement. Walkways must be clearly delineated from vehicular access and
other areas by curbs, landscaping, or other elements as approved by the
planning director. Walkways shall be at least four feet (4') in width or wider
where greater pedestrian activity is anticipated. The pathways shall be
constructed with an all weather surface.
   C.   Parking Lot Pathways: Large new or expansion of existing developments
must provide specially marked or paved walkways through parking lots.
Specifically, walkways should be provided every four (4) rows and a maximum
distance of one hundred fifty feet (150') shall be maintained between paths.
Parking lots less than one hundred fifty feet (150') wide or long are exempt
from this requirement. Pathways must be at least five feet (5') in width and
constructed with an all weather surface. The pathway must be separated from
vehicular traffic by an elevation change, change in surface material or color,
or other treatments as approved by the planning director. Where possible, the
pathways shall be aligned to connect with major building entries or other
destinations. The pathways shall conform to the minimum Americans with
disabilities act (ADA) requirements as established by the federal government.
   D.   Parking Location Guidelines: New developments are encouraged to locate
parking areas to the side or rear of buildings. For large sites (more than 2
acres), developments are encouraged to limit parking areas to no more than
fifty percent (50%) of the lot frontage (other areas may be buildings and/or
open space). Developments that meet these guidelines qualify for all of the
following:
      1.   Landscaping buffers between any parking lot and a street may be
reduced by fifty percent (50%) in width.
      2.   Minimum front yard requirements may be reduced by fifty percent
(50%).
      3.   Setbacks for freestanding signs may be reduced to five feet (5').
   E.   Main Building Entry Standards For Commercial Uses: Weather protection
at least four feet (4') deep shall be provided over all building entries.
Accessory building entrances, service only entrances and secondary residence
entrances are exempted from this requirement. Building entry standards are
strongly recommended for industrial uses.

   F.   Lighting Standards:
      1.   Lighting shall be directed downward to the intended area to be
lighted. All exterior lighting fixtures shall incorporate cutoff shields to
prevent spillover into residential areas. Broadcast lighting fixtures that
project lighting outward rather than downward are discouraged. Outdoor lighting
shall be arranged so that the light is directed downward and away from
adjoining properties. Temporary high intensity construction lights should be
oriented so as to reduce or eliminate glare onto adjoining properties.
      2.   Freestanding light fixtures shall be limited to fourteen feet (14')
in height.
      3.   Vehicular roadway and highway lighting shall be subject to the
county requirements.
      4.   Mercury vapor light fixtures are prohibited.
      5.   When using decorative miniature lighting strings, bulbs larger than
eleven (11) watts each shall not be used. Low wattage, light emitting diode
devices and other lighting that reduces electrical use is encouraged.
      6.   Backlit awnings are prohibited.
The above lighting standards are encouraged for single- family uses in all
zones.
   G.   Blank Wall Treatment Standards: Untreated "blank walls", as defined in
section
12-802 of this title, adjacent to a street or customer/resident parking areas
are prohibited. The intent is to add visual character of commercial and multi-
family areas and add visual interest. Proposed methods to treat blank walls
shall be submitted at the time of building location permit or building permit
and shall include one or more of the following:
      1.   Transparent windows or doors.
      2.   Display windows.
      3.   Landscaped bed at least five feet (5') wide in front of the wall
with planting materials sufficient to obscure at least fifty percent (50%) of
the wall surface within three (3) years.
      4.   A vertical trellis in front of the wall with climbing vines or other
plant materials. The trellis must be of sufficient size to enable plant
materials to cover at least fifty percent (50%) of the wall surface within
three (3) years.
      5.   Special architectural design features and/or use of materials that
add visual interest and mitigates the visual impact of a blank wall. Developers
are encouraged to incorporate landscaping elements in front of portions of the
wall.
      6.   Other methods that add visual interest and mitigate the visual
impact of a blank wall as approved by the planning director.
For blank walls that are longer than one hundred feet (100'), a combination of
treatments are encouraged to add visual interest to commercial and multi-family
areas.

   H.   Maximum Building Width: For all building facades adjacent to a street
or customer/resident parking areas, the maximum building width shall be one
hundred twenty feet (120'). The planning director may grant exceptions to the
maximum building width, provided the building design complies with the
following options:
      1.   The building features vertical building modulation so that it
reduces the perceived scale of the building or makes it appear that it is two
(2) separate buildings. To achieve this, the depth of vertical modulation must
be at least twenty feet (20') and the width of the vertical modulation must be
at least thirty feet (30'). Two (2) examples of how this is achieved is
illustrated in
figure 4-4 of this section.
      2.   Other treatments that successfully reduce the perceived scale of the
building or make it appear that it is two (2) separate buildings as per the
planning director. Examples include articulation techniques (repeating window
patterns, changes in building materials or architectural detailing, or roofline
modulation) that break the scale of the building down into components that are
less than one hundred twenty feet (120') in width.

   I.   Recreational Space For Multi-Family Developments: Multi-family
developments featuring more than four (4) dwelling units shall provide at least
two hundred fifty (250) square feet of on site recreational space per dwelling
unit. Examples of on site recreational space include landscaped courtyards,
centralized lawn areas that can be used for informal recreational activities,
common or private decks or balconies, or children's play areas. Such space
shall be located, designed and maintained per the following:
      1.   Space shall be placed in a dedicated recreation tract or area if
developed in conjunction with a planned unit development or subdivision.
      2.   Space shall be maintained by the landowner, homeowners' association,
or other incorporated organization or private organization formed to provide
long term care of the recreational space.
      3.   Space shall be centrally located in an area that is visible from two
(2) or more of the proposed dwelling units.
      4.   Space contains physical conditions that allow for active and passive
recreation. For example, slopes should generally be less than five percent
(5%), soils and hydrological conditions should be compatible with desired
active and passive recreational activities.
      5.   Space shall have no dimension less than thirty feet (30') except for
trail segments and balconies.
      6.   Balconies and private decks may qualify for up to fifty percent
(50%) of the required recreational space.
      7.   Required setback areas shall not be counted as on site recreational
space unless the planning director finds that the design of the space will be
usable for active and/or passive recreational activities.
      8.   Space shall feature landscaping and other amenities to make the area
usable for active and/or passive recreational activities.
      9.   Large developments are encouraged to provide a range of activities
that accommodate a range of age groups.
Exceptions: Developments in the alpine village district shall be exempted from
these requirements. Also, developments in conservation subdivisions, where
indicated on the final plat, may use common open space to meet these
requirements where the applicant can successfully demonstrate that the design
of the common open space will meet the recreational needs of residents.
   J.   Outdoor Storage: Outdoor storage of commercial and industrial
materials:
      1.   Will be screened from view from any existing adjoining residence or
residential zoned area, whether or not such property is separated by an alley
or street per landscaping standards in
subchapter 4.6 of this chapter.
      2.   Will not be located in any front yard setback.
   K.   Solid Waste, Recycling Collection Areas: All solid waste and recycling
collection areas for commercial, industrial and multi-family residential uses:

ages and interests.
      2.   To create an efficient layout of dwelling units that reduces the
development footprint and infrastructure costs.
      3.   To ensure that the overall size, including bulk and mass of cottage
structures and cottage housing developments, remains smaller and incurs less
visual impact than standard sized single-family dwellings.
      4.   To provide centrally located and functional common open space that
fosters a sense of community and a sense of openness in cottage housing
developments.
      5.   To provide private area around the individual dwellings to enable
diversity in landscape design and foster a sense of ownership.
      6.   To ensure minimal visual impact from vehicular use and storage areas
for residents of the cottage housing development as well as adjacent
properties.
      7.   To maintain a single-family character along public streets.
   B.   Cottage Development Procedural Options: Cottage development applicants
have four (4) procedural options for obtaining approval:
      1.   Applicants intending to retain ownership of all of the units may use
the planned unit development process per
subchapter 2.5 of this title to allow the development of four (4) or more
cottages on a single (or multiple) property.
      2.   Applicants intending to record a condominium plat can use the
planned unit development process per
subchapter 2.5 of this title and the requirements for condominium projects in
subchapter 6.7 of this title.
      3.   Applicants intending to subdivide the individual lots must use the
conservation subdivision process and standards set forth in this title.
      4.   The owner or owners of multiple lot or parcels may reconfigure their
properties through one of the processes above to create a cottage development.
   C.   Cottage Development Approval: The applicants must demonstrate
compliance with all standards in this section. For example, an applicant
seeking to create a speculative cottage housing subdivision must demonstrate
how the site is designed to accommodate cottage units and open spaces
consistent with the standards prescribed herein. The final plats, condominium
plans or development plans, thus, shall include building envelopes, building
design and other standards pursuant to approval of the particular application.
   D.   Permit Applicants To Comply: Building location permit or building
permit applicants for cottage housing unit as approved per subsections B and C
of this section shall comply with the requirements in this section.
   E.   Density Bonus: Due to the reduced size of individual cottages, two (2)
cottages are permitted for every one dwelling unit. For example, for a property
large enough to allow three (3) dwelling units, six (6) individual cottages are
allowed, subject to the standards set forth in this section.
   F.   Dimensional Standards: The dimensional standards for cottage housing
shall be pursuant to

The purpose of the overlay districts is to carry out comprehensive plan and
community, subarea or neighborhood plan policies that seek to minimize hazards,
preserve unique natural resources and/or identify special opportunities for
achieving public benefits by allowing or requiring alternative uses and
development standards that differ from the general provisions of this title.
Overlay districts are generally applied to a group of individual properties or
an entire community, subarea or neighborhood planning area and are designated
primarily through the area zoning process. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-501: ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
Overlay districts are established to permit limited special use activities
which are subject to additional limitations and restrictions. Land within an
overlay district is also subject to the provisions of the underlying zoning
district. Where overlap exists between the standards of the overlay district
and those of the underlying zone, the more stringent standards shall be
applied. The following overlay district designations and zoning map symbols are
adopted:

   (Reserved) (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
SUBCHAPTER 5.2 – AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT
12-520: PURPOSE OF DISTRICT:
The airport overlay district is established for the purpose of preventing the
creation or establishment of "airport hazards", as defined in section
12-801 of this title, or where such hazards are already created or established,
eliminating, removing, altering, mitigating, marking or lighting such airport
hazards. The provisions of this subchapter shall be applicable to, but not
limited to, conditional use permits, special use permits, variances,
preliminary and final plats, lot line adjustments, planned unit developments,
zone changes and building location permits or building permits. (Ord. 501, 11-
18-2008)
12-521: AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED:
In order to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones for existing and future planned airport
conditions as they apply to the Bonner County airport. The zones include all
the land lying within the primary zones, approach zones, transitional zones,
horizontal zones and conical zones. Such zones are shown on the approved
Sandpoint airport master plan 1993-2013, as amended from time to time, which by
this reference is incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in full.
Whenever the zoning map shows zones for future planned airport improvements,
the more stringent future planned zones govern. Their limitations and
boundaries shall be adapted for present zoning purposes. The various zones are
hereby established and defined as follows:
   A.   Utility Runways Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zones: The inner edge
of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
five hundred feet (500') wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of two thousand feet (2,000') at a horizontal distance five thousand feet
(5,000') from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the
centerline of the runway.
   B.   Transitional Zones: These zones are hereby established as the area
beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at
ninety degree (90o) angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline
extended at a slope of seven feet (7') horizontally for each foot vertically
from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to which they intersect in
the horizontal conical surfaces.
   C.   Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging
arcs of five thousand feet (5,000') radii from the center of each end of the
primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing
lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the primary,
approach and transitional zones.
   D.   Conical Zone: The conical zone is hereby established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from the horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). The conical zone
does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional
zones. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-522: AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be
erected, altered, allowed to grow or be maintained in any zone created by this
chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established
for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for
each of the zones in question as follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: Slopes upward
twenty feet (20') horizontally for each one foot (1') vertically beginning at
the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') along the extended runway
centerline.
   B.   Transitional Zones: Slopes upward and outward seven feet (7')
horizontally for each one foot (1') vertically beginning at the sides of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zones, and extending
to a height of one hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation, the
airport elevation which is two thousand one hundred twenty six feet (2,126')
above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established
height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet (7') horizontally for each
one foot (1') vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as
the approach zones, and extending to the intersection with the conical surface.
Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical
zone, height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet (7') horizontally for
each one foot (1') vertically shall be maintained beginning at the sides of and
at the same elevation as precision instrument runway approach surface, and
extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') measured at
ninety degree (90o) angles to the extended runway centerline.
   C.   Horizontal Zone: One hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport
elevation or a height of two thousand two hundred seventy six feet (2,276')
above mean sea level.
   D.   Conical Zone: Slopes upward and outward twenty feet (20') horizontally
for each one foot (1') vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal
zone and at one hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation and
extending to a height of three hundred fifty feet (350') above the airport
elevation.
   E.   Restrictive Limitation Prevails: Where an area is covered by more than
one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. (Ord.
501, 11-18-2008)
12-523: USE RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this subchapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or
otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the Sandpoint airport.
   B.   No change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree
shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby
created unless in conformance with this subchapter.
   C.   No use or structure shall be established that would allow the creation
of an "airport hazard", as defined in section
12-801 of this title, or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to
become a greater hazard to air navigation than the hazard was on the effective
date hereof, or any amendments thereto. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-524: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   The regulations prescribed by this subchapter shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure
or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was
begun prior to the effective date hereof, and is diligently prosecuted;
provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall restrict or otherwise
interfere with the use of North Boyer Avenue by vehicular traffic.
   B.   Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of
any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the chairperson of the board to indicate to the
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and
maintained at the expense of the county.
   C.   Nonconforming uses are subject to the provisions for nonconforming uses
as set forth generally in this title. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-525: VARIANCES:
   A.   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in accordance with the
regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply for a variance from such
regulations, the procedure for variances as set forth generally in this title.
   B.   However, a tree or structure of less than forty five feet (45') of
vertical height above the ground is permitted in the horizontal and conical
zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of
four thousand two hundred feet (4,200') from each end of the runway, except
when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective
zone.
   C.   Any variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstance,
be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question
to permit the county, at the owner's expense, to install, operate and maintain
thereon such markers and lights as may be deemed necessary by the Bonner County
airport commission or other appropriate agencies as necessary to indicate to
pilots the presence of an "airport hazard", as defined in section
12-801 of this title.
   D.   Variance applications required by this chapter are to be submitted by
applicant to the Bonner County planning department for review by the:
      1.   Bonner County airport commission for its review and recommendation;
      2.   Federal aviation administration; and
      3.   Other appropriate agencies as necessary. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)

a certificate of compliance with the Bonner County Recorder. The certificate of
compliance shall identify the lot or parcel, and shall state that the lot or
parcel resulting from a division of land complies with the applicable
provisions of this Code in effect at the time the division occurred.
   C.   If the Planning Director, upon reviewing the application, determines
that the lot or parcel resulting from a division of land did not comply with
the applicable provisions of this Code in effect at the time the division
occurred, and upon the effective date of the determination pursuant to this
section, the Planning Director shall record, on a form provided by the Planning
Department, a conditional certificate of compliance with the Bonner County
Recorder. The conditional certificate of compliance shall identify the lot or
parcel, and shall state that the lot or parcel resulting from a division of
land will comply with the applicable provisions of this Code in effect at the
time the division occurred upon completing only those conditions which would
have been applicable to the lot or parcel at the time the division occurred.
The conditional certificate of compliance shall list those conditions.
Compliance with the conditions listed shall be required prior to the issuance
of any permit for the development or use of the property. The Planning Director
shall record a certificate of compliance upon the applicant completing the
listed conditions. A recorded final plat or notice of land division pursuant to
this chapter constitutes a certificate of compliance with respect to the lot or
parcel described therein.
   D.   If the Planning Director, upon reviewing a permit for the development
or use of any lot or parcel, determines that the lot or parcel resulting from a
division of land did not comply with the applicable provisions of this Code in
effect at the time the division occurred, and upon the effective date of the
determination pursuant to this section, the Planning Director shall record, on
a form provided by the Planning Department, a conditional certificate of
compliance with the Bonner County Recorder. The conditional certificate of
compliance shall identify the lot or parcel and shall state that the lot or
parcel resulting from a division of land will comply with the applicable
provisions of this Code in effect at the time the division occurred upon
completing only those conditions which would have been applicable to the lot or
parcel at the time the division occurred. The conditional certificate of
compliance shall list those conditions. Compliance with the conditions listed
shall be required prior to the issuance of any permit for the development or
use of the lot or parcel. The Planning Director shall record a certificate of
compliance on the application completing the listed conditions. A conditional
certificate of compliance recorded pursuant to this subsection shall include as
a condition the fee as set forth at section
12-265 of this title.
   E.   For the purposes of the administration of this section, the following
shall be considered to be in compliance:
      1.   Any lot or parcel which is described on a recorded legal instrument
of conveyance prior to November 18, 2008;
      2.   Any lot or parcel for which a valid building permit or building
location permit has been issued by Bonner County since November 18, 2008,
whereon development has occurred and a use has been established in reliance on
that permit;.
      3.   A recorded final plat or notice of land division pursuant to this
chapter constitutes a certificate of compliance with respect to the lot or
parcel described therein.
      4.   When an original parcel or lot is divided by a public right of way
as a result of some kind of governmental action (e.g. the construction of a
road or railway through a parcel or lot, thereby dividing it), each of the two
resulting parcels or lots shall be deemed original parcels or lots and shall
have an origination date equal to that of the governmental action. The burden
of proof shall be on the applicant to provide. (Ord. 551, 3-9-2016; Ord. 607,
7-22-2020; Ord. 681, 10-12-2022; Ord. 682, 10-12-2022)
SUBCHAPTER 6.2 - DESIGN STANDARDS

center districts provided such access meets the applicable private road
standards of this title.
   E.   For the purposes of a boundary line adjustment, family division, or lot
line adjustment legal access shall be provided to each proposed lot or parcel,
which shall demonstrate ingress and egress. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008; amd. Ord.
524, 1-11-2012; Ord. 681, 10-12-2022; Ord. 682, 10-12-2022)
12-625: TRAILS AND PARKS:
   A.   Trails:
      1.   Implementing Bonner County Trails Plan: New subdivisions should be
integrated with, and expand upon, existing and planned trail network per the
Bonner County trails plan adopted by the Bonner County board of county
commissioners. Subdivisions on land featuring proposed trails per the Bonner
County trails plan are required to construct the trail as part of the
subdivision approval. The Bonner County trails plan shall be used as a guide to
determine the appropriate alignment and design any public trails or pathways
(where applicable).
      2.   Public Access To Trails: All public trails shall be provided within
public rights of way (when approved by the entity having jurisdiction over the
right of way), designated common open space or within a trail easement
dedicated or conveyed to Bonner County, or to the entity that will provide
maintenance as approved by the board. The width of the common open space or
easement shall be sufficient to provide for trail maintenance activities. When
future access may be needed to adjacent parcels of land, trail easements and/or
rights of way shall extend to the property line of the subdivision.
      3.   Sidewalks/Pathways In Residential Subdivisions: All residential
subdivisions featuring average residential lot sizes of less than twelve
thousand (12,000) square feet shall provide a sidewalk/pathway system that
connects all residential lots in the subdivision. Conservation subdivisions in
the rural or A/F districts are exempt, except where there are more than ten
(10) contiguous residential lots averaging less than twelve thousand (12,000)
square feet in size.
      4.   Developing Design Standards For Trails: Trail width and design
standards and guidelines shall be developed in accord with the adopted trails
plan.
   B.   Public Access, Parks And Facilities: Public access easements or the
conveyance of land for public access, parks or facilities may be required for
subdivisions that are contiguous to: 1) public lands; 2) public streams, lakes,
ponds, wetlands or similar areas; or 3) for areas designated in a county
facilities acquisition plan. If so required, the property owner shall be paid
fair market value for the easement or land, or may qualify for a density bonus
as part of a conservation subdivision set forth in section
12-637 of this chapter. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-626: ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES:
   A.   The subdivision shall be designed around identified natural hazards
(highly erosive soils on steep slopes, landslide areas, rock falls, areas of
subsidence, floodplains) to protect building sites and roads from damage from
such hazards.
   B.   The subdivision shall meet the requirements of chapter 7,
"Environmental Standards", of this title.
   C.   All subdivisions containing waterfront property shall conform to the
following standards:
      1.   New lots or parcels on sites in the forestry, agricultural/forestry,
rural and other zoning districts where all urban services are not available,
shall maintain an average width (as measured parallel to the shoreline) of at
least two hundred feet (200') for all portions of the lot or parcel within one
hundred feet (100') of the shoreline. The total depth of the lot (as measured
from the shoreline to the opposite end of the lot or parcel) must be deep
enough to allow development to meet applicable vegetation conservation and
building setback requirements per
subchapter 7.1 in this title.
      2.   New lots or parcels not in the forestry, agricultural/forestry or
rural zoning districts and containing all urban services, shall maintain an
average width (as measured parallel to the shoreline) of at least one hundred
feet (100') for all portions of the lot within one hundred feet (100') of the
shoreline. The total depth of the lot (as measured from the shoreline to the
opposite end of the lot or parcel) must be deep enough to allow development to
meet applicable vegetation conservation and building setback requirements per
subchapter 7.1 in this title. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-627: SUBDIVISIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND RURAL SERVICE CENTER DISTRICTS:
Subdivision applicants in both districts shall demonstrate how the proposed
lots are appropriate for applicable residential and/or nonresidential uses
where permitted in sections
12-332 through
12-336 (tables 3-2 through 3-6) of this title. Individual lots shall be sized
appropriately to accommodate permitted uses in the district, or may be designed
to accommodate a particular set of permitted uses (for example, townhouses,
which feature common walls and zero lot lines). The board may place conditions
on the lots that restrict uses and the exact location and nature of
development. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
SUBCHAPTER 6.3 - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS
12-630: PURPOSE:
   A.   Encourage creative and flexible site design that is sensitive to the
land's natural features and adapts to the natural topography;
   B.   Protect environmentally sensitive areas of a development site and
preserve on a permanent basis open space, natural features and prime
agricultural lands;
   C.   Minimize water quality impacts by reducing the amount of impervious
surfaces in site development;
   D.   Promote cost savings in infrastructure installation and maintenance by
such techniques as reducing the distance over which utilities, such as water
and sewer lines, need to be extended, or by reducing the width or length of
streets; and
   E.   Provide opportunities walking and hiking in open space areas. (Ord.
501, 11-18-2008)
12-631: DESCRIPTION AND DEFINITIONS:
A "conservation subdivision" is a subdivision where lots are clustered in
specific areas to allow the remaining land to be used for recreation, open
space, agriculture and/or preservation of features and/or structures with
environmental, historical, cultural or other significance. "Conservation
subdivisions" may include the following terms:
CLUSTER LOT: A cluster lot is a lot in a conservation subdivision (typically
smaller than the minimum lot size for the applicable zoning district) in which
residential development can occur.
COMMON OPEN SPACE: A part of a conservation subdivision that is set aside in
perpetuity as open space. This area may include freshwater wetlands,
floodplains or flood hazard areas, stream corridors, recreational areas, prime
agricultural lands, wildlife habitat, scenic views, historical or cultural
features, archaeological sites, or other land to be protected from development,
as well as easements for public utilities.
CONSERVATION LOT: A large (larger than the minimum lot size for the applicable
zoning district) privately owned (not common) lot in a conservation
subdivision. Such lot may incur a dwelling unit, but it will count against the
overall density of a subdivision. A conservation lot may be an alternative to
common open space. For example, a property owner can subdivide a portion of
property into a number of smaller cluster lots and retain most of the acreage
for him or herself.
DEVELOPMENT RESERVE LOT:
   A.   An area in a conservation subdivision that is set aside for future
development opportunities. For example, owners of suburban zoned land that do
not yet have all urban services may choose to create a conservation subdivision
to cluster lots and create a development reserve lot that allows for future
development once urban water and sewer services are provided on the land.
   B.   Property owners can choose to utilize a combination of lot types. For
instance, it is possible to have both a conservation lot and common open space
in a conservation subdivision.

(Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-632: APPLICABILITY, PROCEDURES AND PREAPPLICATION REVIEW:
   A.   Applicability: A conservation subdivision shall be permitted as of
right in any zoning district.
   B.   Procedures: Conservation subdivisions are subject to the standard
preliminary plat procedures set forth in
subchapter 6.4 of this chapter.
   C.   Preapplication Review Required: The developer or developer's
representative for a conservation subdivision shall meet with the planning
director or designee, prior to submitting an application. The purpose of this
meeting is to discuss early and informally with the developer, the purpose and
qualifying provisions of this chapter along with any known constraints in order
to assist the applicant in determining the feasibility of the proposal. The
preapplication review shall include a general description of the proposed
subdivision, and a sketch map of sufficient scale to convey the scope and
layout of the proposed subdivision. Discussions may include the concept, the
applicable regulations and standards, comprehensive plan objectives and
specific problems with the proposed subdivision such as impacts on roads,
schools or potential conflicts with surrounding land uses. (Ord. 501, 11-18-
2008)
12-633: STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR ALL CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Uses: All principal and accessory uses authorized in the applicable
zoning districts shall be allowed in the conservation subdivision. Uses not
authorized by chapter 3 of this title will not be permitted in conservation
subdivisions.
   B.   Development Standards: Development standards in chapter 4 of this title
for the applicable zoning district shall apply to all lots in a conservation
subdivision, except where otherwise noted in this chapter.
   C.   Design Standards: Conservation subdivisions are subject to
subchapter 6.2 of this title, design standards, except where otherwise noted.
   D.   Minimum Lot Size: Cluster lots may be smaller than the minimum lot size
for the applicable zoning district, provided the following requirements are
met:
      1.   The minimum lot size for lots containing both individual wells and
septic within the boundaries of the lot shall be two and one-half (21/2) acres.
      2.   The minimum lot size for lots containing either individual wells or
septic (but not both) within the boundaries of the lot shall be one acre.
      3.   Lots may be smaller than the minimum sizes in subsections D1 and D2
of this section, provided water and sewage disposal provisions are provided
within common areas via utility easements.
   E.   Suitable Land: Cluster lots are encouraged to be located on land most
suitable for residential development. For example, where the site contains
floodplains and/or wetlands, such floodplains and/or wetlands are encouraged to
be designated as common open space.
   F.   Further Subdivision Of Cluster Lots: Cluster lots in a conservation
subdivision may not be further subdivided except where in compliance with this
title. For example, if a forty (40) acre conservation subdivision in the R-10
zoning district contains 4 two (2) acre lots and a thirty two (32) acre common
open space is rezoned to R-5, each of the four (4) cluster lots may be split
into two (2) lots to achieve maximum density per the R-5 standards, pursuant to
the procedures set forth in this chapter. However, notes on the final plat as
approved by the board may include other restrictions on future subdivision of
the lots.
   G.   Wells, Sewage Disposal Facilities Within Common Open Space: Individual
and/or common wells and sewage disposal facilities may be provided within
designated common open space areas to allow for maximum efficiency of cluster
lot design and minimize potential negative impacts to the environment.
Applicable easements for the facilities shall be shown on the final plat.
   H.   Preservation Of Common Open Space: Common open space shall be preserved
as permanent open space, except where otherwise noted in this title, and
subject to the following standards:
      1.   A management plan is required for the designated common open space.
The plan shall be submitted and approved with the preliminary plat application.
The plan shall include all of the following items:
         a.   Details concerning ownership, tax liability and responsible
parties for maintenance of open space.
         b.   Use of the designated common open space shall be in accordance
with this title.
         c.   Details concerning permanent protection of open space.
         d.   Details on maintenance of the open space, including control of
noxious weeds.
         e.   Any construction activities (trails, fencing, agricultural
buildings) and vegetative clearing that may occur on site.
      2.   All subsequent activities must be conducted in conformance with the
approved open space management plan. Open space management plans may be
modified through amendment procedures for a plat alteration, but in no case
shall perpetually dedicated open space be revoked.
      3.   The open space management plan, as described above, shall be
referenced on the face of the final plat and shall be filed as a title notice.
   I.   Unavailable Urban Services: For conservation subdivisions in the
suburban, commercial, industrial, recreation, rural service center or alpine
village zoning districts where all urban services are not available, land may
be set aside for future development as a "development reserve lot" if and when
the applicable urban services become available. Such a lot may be privately
owned or collectively owned by the owners of all subdivision lots. See
subsection
12-637A2 of this subchapter for related density bonus provisions. Specific
requirements for development reserve lots:
      1.   For such conservation subdivisions, the following title notice shall
be filed on the property and adjacent properties within the plat and the
wording shall additionally be placed on the face of the plat:
Lot        , Block        , of            is a development reserve lot reserved
for future development when urban services become available. Future development
of this parcel may include uses permitted in the applicable zoning district.
The lot is not intended to be preserved in perpetuity as open space, as
indicated by the consent(s) to plat recorded at Instrument #            .
      2.   Applicants shall submit a sketch of a prospective future street
system and lot layout on development reserve lots to demonstrate that the land
can be subdivided in conformance with the design standards of this title.
   J.   Conservation Lot As Alternative: As an alternative to designated common
open space, applicants may choose to include a large "conservation lot" that is
privately owned and maintained. A conservation lot may incur a dwelling unit,
provided it counts against the overall density of the subdivision.
   K.   Buffering, Clustering: Clustered lots shall be accessed by interior
road systems. To the maximum extent possible, cluster lots shall be located so
that common open space provides a buffer between the cluster lots and adjacent
properties and/or right of way. When this is not possible, the development
shall be designed to provide at a minimum one of the following:
      1.   Cluster lots that abut surrounding properties or right of way shall
be at least seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum lot size standard for the
subject parcel.
      2.   Cluster lots that abut surrounding properties or right of way shall
be separated from adjacent properties or right of way by a minimum buffer strip
of one hundred feet (100'). At a minimum, proposed or existing landscaping and
vegetation within the buffer strip shall be of sufficient size and type to
provide a buffer of vegetation six feet (6') in height and fifty percent (50%)
opaque year round within three (3) years of planting. New landscaping materials
shall consist of a combination of native trees and shrubs, as provided in
appendix B of this title. Variations to these standards may be permitted where
the applicant can demonstrate that unique topographic conditions provide
sufficient buffering, such as intervening waterways, ridges or ravines or other
land features. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-634: STANDARDS FOR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS IN AGRICULTURAL/FORESTRY-20
DISTRICT:
All conservation subdivisions in the A/F-20 zoning district shall use the
conservation subdivision design standards set forth below:
   A.   Cluster lots shall be located on land least suitable FOR commercial
agricultural or forestry purposes based on soil types, slopes, adjacent uses or

12-625 of this chapter.
4. Provide other public amenities. The
board may approve bonus lots for other
improvements and amenities, both on and
off site, where the applicant can
successfully demonstrate that the
proposed improvements/amenities benefit Up to 25 percent
the public. See subsections D and E of
this section for examples and
requirements. Improvements required to
mitigate impacts shall not be used to
earn bonus lots.
5. Bonus for urban sewer (where not
required to achieve given density)      25 percent
(i.e., suburban using "urban sewer" to
get to smaller acres)
 
   D.   Public Amenities: Below are public amenities that can be provided to
obtain a density bonus. All are subject to approval by the board:
      1.   Construct recreational improvements that are available for the use
by the general public. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, play
fields, picnic shelters, children play areas and indoor recreational
facilities. Applicants must successfully demonstrate that the improvements are
safe, accessible and desirable to the general public.
      2.   Construct public facilities such as schools, fire stations or
libraries. To qualify, the land and/or facilities must be accepted by the
applicable public agency. The land itself set aside for such public use shall
be considered as common open space for the purposes of obtaining a density
bonus.
      3.   Pave roadways (where they are not required to be paved).
      4.   Provide environmental improvements as certified by wetlands, plant
or other biologists having expert knowledge of the specific environmental
feature. An example could be replacement of nonnative vegetation with native
vegetation in common open space areas. Such improvements are particularly
desirable in and around wetland areas and designated critical wildlife habitat.
      5.   Provide off site road improvements (above and beyond what is
required by board for subdivision approval).
The applicant shall include a cost estimate for the proposed public amenity
improvements prepared by a professional construction estimator, registered
general contractor, engineer, architect or landscape architect, which shall be
submitted with the application. The cost estimate shall be limited to physical
improvements, labor and utility costs associated with the proposed public
amenity feature.
   E.   Requirements For Density Bonus: To qualify for a density bonus, the
proposed public amenity must meet the following requirements:
      1.   Applicants must successfully demonstrate how the improvements
benefit the public.
      2.   The percentage of density bonus shall be commensurate with the cost
of the applicable improvements per the following scale:
Cost of proposed improvements = $Y
Density bonus = Extra lot or lots* valued at the equivalent of two (2) times
the cost of proposed improvements (2 x Y) up to a maximum density bonus of
twenty five percent (25%).
*The average value of lots in the proposed subdivision as determined by a state
licensed appraiser at the time the application is submitted. The appraised
value shall take into account the average size of proposed lots, proposed
physical improvements (including proposed amenities), and locational
attributes.
For example, if the applicant proposes off site road improvements costing an
estimated fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the applicant is then eligible for
a bonus lot or lots equaling up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)
in assessed value. If a state licensed appraiser concludes that the average
market value for one of the proposed cluster lots is fifty thousand dollars
($50,000.00), then the applicant qualifies for up to two (2) additional lots
(provided the extra lots do not exceed 25 percent of the total density of the
subdivision). (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)

Director shall cause a review of the proposed final plat to verify conformance
with the provisions of this title and the conditions of preliminary plat
approval.
   B.   The applicant shall prepare a final plat which conforms to the
requirements for final plats set forth at Idaho Code section 50-1304, bearing
the endorsement certificates as required at section
12-647 of this subchapter and Idaho Code title 50, chapter 13.
   C.   Upon receipt of such plat, and the payment of the plat checking fee as
set forth at section
12-265 of this title, the Planning Director shall cause an examination of such
plat by endorsing agencies and a licensed surveyor, registered in the State of
Idaho for checking in accordance with the requirements of Idaho Code section
50-1305. When such agencies have signed the plat and all plat certificates,
except those of the Board, Recorder and Planning Director have been endorsed,
the Planning Director shall place the request for final plat approval on the
agenda for the next available meeting of the Board of County Commissioners.
   D.   The Board shall approve the final plat when:
      1.   The final plat conforms to the requirements of Idaho Code and this
Code; and
      2.   The final plat conforms with the approved preliminary plat; and
      3.   The conditions of preliminary and final plat approval have been
completed or financially guaranteed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   E.   The Board may continue consideration of the final plat approval to a

SUBCHAPTER 6.5 - SHORT PLATS, PROCEDURES
12-650: APPLICATION/CONTENTS OF PRELIMINARY PLATS FOR SHORT PLAT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Purpose: To define the procedures for which an administrative approval
may be granted for the development of five (5) to ten (10) lots; to encourage
small scale development which conforms to the intent and scope of the Bonner
County comprehensive plan by providing a means for land development other than
the regular subdivision process; and to expedite the subdivision approval of
developments that conform with the comprehensive plan and this chapter. The
procedures of a regular subdivision apply to the short plat with the exceptions
as outlined in this section.
   B.   Application: Applications for short plats which contain five (5) to ten
(10) contiguous lots under common ownership may be processed as "short plats"
as set forth in sections
12-651 through
12-652 of this subchapter.
   C.   Permit Required: Lots created by a short plat, shall only be eligible
for one short plat for a period of not less than two (2) years. Land divisions
done prior to the end of the two (2) year period shall be processed as a
subdivision.
   D.   Contents: The contents of the preliminary short plat shall include all
of the items set forth in
subchapter 6.2 of this chapter. (Ord. 557, 11-10-2016; amd. Ord. 607, 7-22-
2020)
12-651: SHORT PLAT, PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY SHORT PLAT:
   A.   The applicant shall file an application for a preliminary short plat
with the planning department, pursuant to the procedures of section
12-268 of this title.
   B.   Upon the determination of the planning director that an application is
complete, the planning department shall:
      1.   Send copies of the application, by first class mail, to public
agencies and entities pursuant to section
12-268 of this title.
      2.   Provide notice of the proposed short plat by first class mail to all
property owners of record within three hundred feet (300') of the external
boundaries of the land being considered. The notice shall, at a minimum,
include the applicant's name, a description of the proposed short plat and the
general location of the property. The notice shall advise of a thirty (30) day
written comment period beginning the day after notice is mailed.
      3.   Provide notice to the official county newspaper of record. The
notice shall provide a summary of the proposal and advise of the thirty (30)
day comment period.
      4.   When a short plat is in an area of city impact (ACI) the notice
requirement shall be forty (40) days.
   C.   At the close of the comment and review period and upon a determination
by the planning director that the agency review comments have been addressed by
the applicant, the planning department shall issue a staff report containing,
at a minimum, proposed findings, conclusions and conditions of approval and a
recommendation for action. Any response to the staff report by the applicant or
interested parties shall be received by the planning department not later than
ten (10) days after the issuance of the report.
   D.   Following the ten (10) day response period, the planning director shall
consider the application for the preliminary short plat, any comments received,
the facts on the record and the standards for considering the short plat
application and may:
      1.   Approve the preliminary short plat, as presented;
      2.   Approve the preliminary short plat, as modified in any particular;
      3.   Continue action on the short plat to a date certain, pending changes
to be made in the application, the short plat design or the receipt of
additional information;
      4.   Deny the application for preliminary short plat;
      5.   Recommend the board conduct a public hearing pursuant to the public
hearing noticing requirements and procedures set forth in
subchapter 2.6 of this title, based upon the extent of public comment or other
contested factors in the case which warrant a full hearing before the board.
This option may be selected at any time following the initiation of the review
and comment period when evidence of the record supports it, to ensure prompt
processing of the application for hearing.
   E.   The planning director shall render a decision in writing, setting forth
the ordinance provisions and standards used, all comments received from the
neighbors and agencies, the facts of the application and such conclusions as
support the decision. If the planning director denies the preliminary short
plat, the planning director shall specify in the decision the actions, if any,
which the applicant could take to obtain approval.
   F.   As a part of its decision approving an application for a preliminary
plat, the planning director may require the completion of improvements (such as
roads, utilities or stormwater management controls) prior to final plat
approval. Improvements not completed prior to final plat approval are subject
to surety agreements pursuant to section
12-644 of this chapter. In addition to the standards set forth in this chapter,
the planning director may stipulate conditions to be placed on the final plat
provided evidence of record is sufficient, which may include:
      1.   Minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties.
      2.   Designating the exact location and nature of development.
      3.   Requiring the provision of on or off site public facilities or
services.
      4.   Assuring the development is maintained properly.
      5.   Provisions for setbacks that are greater than the minimum standards
set forth in this title to mitigate effects of the development on wildlife,
fisheries, wetlands, adjoining properties, or to reduce hazards due to
floodplain, floodways, steep slopes or other physical constraints of the land,
provided evidence is deemed sufficient to warrant greater setbacks.
      6.   Safeguards to protect adjoining properties.
   G.   The preliminary short plat shall be valid for a period not to exceed
two (2) calendar years from the date of approval. At any time prior to the
expiration date of the preliminary short plat, an applicant may make a written
request to the planning director for an extension of the preliminary short plat
for a period up to two (2) years, finding that conditions or applicable
regulations have not changed so substantially as to warrant reconsideration of
the proposed subdivision with respect to the public health, safety, and general
welfare. The planning director may recommend such request for extension at any
regular business meeting of the board of commissioners. The extension request
must be approved or denied prior to the expiration date of the preliminary
short plat.
   H.   Any determination made by the planning director in the administration
of this section may be appealed to the board by notifying the planning director
in writing of the intent to appeal within ten (10) calendar days from the date
of the determination. Upon receipt of the appeal, the planning director shall
schedule the application for a public hearing before the board, allowing
sufficient time for notice. The board shall conduct a public hearing and
consider the application, in accord with the procedures set forth in
subchapter 2.6 of this title.

SUBCHAPTER 6.6 - MINOR LAND DIVISIONS
12-660: MINOR LAND DIVISION PROCEDURE:
   A.   Purpose: To ensure that land divisions comply with the applicable
zoning regulations; to establish a ministerial review of all land divisions;
and to expedite the process for those small divisions of land that conform to
the existing zone regulations in which the division lies.
   B.   Procedure: Applications for a minor land division which contain four
(4) or fewer contiguous lots under common ownership may be processed as “minor
land divisions” as set forth in this section and section
12-661 of this subchapter; provided, that no planned unit development is
requested to accommodate the proposed lot sizes.
   C.   Permit Required: Lots created by a minor land division, shall only be
eligible for one minor land division for a period of not less than two (2)
years. Land divisions done prior to the end of the two (2) year period shall be
processed as a subdivision or short plat.
   D.   Application: The application for a minor land division shall include:
      1.   Application: Prior to recordation of a deed or MLD plat, each
application for a minor land division shall be submitted on a form provided by
the Planning Department with appropriate fees approved by the Board of County
Commissioners.
      2.   Design Criteria: The MLD shall conform to the following design
criteria:
         a.   Any new and existing easements or roads showing access to each
property, considering alignment with existing or planned roads.
         b.   All proposed lots which are three hundred feet (300') or less in
width shall maintain a depth to width ratio of not greater than three point two
to one (3.2:1); and lots which are more than three hundred feet (300') in width
shall maintain a depth to width ration of not greater than four point two to
one (4.2:1). All proposed lots one hundred feet (100') or less in width shall
be designed so that the angle of intersection of the side lot lines with the
fronting road is between eighty-five (85) and ninety-five degrees (95), for a
distance of not less than fifty feet (50') from the point of intersection.
Submerged lands are exempt from the requirements herein.
         c.   Lands below the applicable natural or ordinary water mark, or the
applicable artificial high water mark, of any lake, river, stream, channel or
other body of public water shall not be counted in the calculations for
determining the maximum density for a subdivision. For example, if a forty (40)
acre parcel in the R-5 zoning district contains thirty (30) acres submerged
under Lake Pend Oreille’s artificial high water mark, then the parcel contains
ten (10) “usable” acres for the purpose of determining the maximum density in a
subdivision.
         d.   The division shall be designed around identified natural hazards
(highly erosive soils on steep slopes, landslide areas, rock falls, areas of
subsidence, floodplains) to protect building sites and roads from damage from
such hazards.
         e.   All plats shall include the sanitary restriction or the sanitary
restriction lift per Idaho Code 50-13266.
         f.   The lot size minimum shall be appropriate for the zone in which
the division is located.
         g.   Resulting lots shall not be divided by boundary of any city,
county, zoning designation, railroad right-of-way, or public right-of-way.
      3.   MLD Plat: The legal description and MLD plat shall be prepared by an
Idaho State registered land surveyor and shall include the plat certifications,
descriptions, approvals and comments as set forth in sections
12-646,
12-647 and
12-649 of this chapter.

591, 10-23-2019; Ord. 696, 7-12-2023)
12-661: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF MINOR LAND DIVISION:
Upon receipt and review of completeness, the planning and zoning department
shall:
   A.   Review the MLD plat and supplemental information to determine
compliance with these ordinances and prepare its report, which shall include
comments received from other departments.
   B.   Distribute the application to the county surveyor, the Assessor, the
road and bridge department, GIS and floodplain administrator for review and
compliance.
   C.   Based on the above findings, the planning director shall approve,
conditionally approve, or deny the application within ninety (90) days, from
the date of a completed application was stamped as received.
   D.   If administratively approved, the final plat shall be transmitted to
the board of county commissioners at the next business meeting for review and
possible approval.

or more existing adjacent lots or parcels where land taken from one lot or
parcel is added to an adjacent lot or parcel, but not to include readjustments
where public right of way is proposed for dedication. Where dedication is
proposed, the procedures for short plats, as set forth in this chapter, shall
be followed. Applications for readjustment may include:
      1.   The combining of two (2) or more lots.
      2.   Any adjustment of lot lines where no additional lots or parcels than
originally existed are created; and where no lot or parcel is reduced below the
minimum lot or parcel size for the zoning district in which the lots or parcels
are located, except that if a lot or parcel is already below the minimum lot or
parcel size, the lot or parcel shall not be further reduced in size and none of
the reconfigured lots shall be smaller than the smallest original lot or
parcel.
   B.   The board shall retain the authority to make a final determination when
any question should arise as to whether the provisions of this section are
applicable under any particular circumstance.
(Ord. 501, 11-18-2008; amd. Ord. 591, 10-23-2019)

12-700: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to:
   A.   Preserve and manage the county's natural resources, including pure
water, clean air and diverse wildlife, to attain the greatest long term public
benefit.
   B.   To protect its community from the loss of lives and property and to
reduce public and private financial losses due to flood, fire, mass wasting,
avalanches and excessive slopes by setting standards for development within
hazard areas and discouraging development in high hazard areas. (Ord. 501, 11-
18-2008)
SUBCHAPTER 7.1 - SHORELINES
12-710: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this subchapter is:
   A.   To preserve both the quality and quantity of Bonner County water
resources.
   B.   To reduce erosion and sedimentation into waterways. (Ord. 501, 11-18-
2008)
12-711: SHORELINE SETBACKS:
   A.   The following shoreline setbacks shall apply in all zoning districts:
      1.   For lakes, sloughs, ponds or other similar basins, or the Clark Fork
or Pend Oreille rivers, or intermittent streams as shown on the national
hydrography dataset (NHD), no structure shall be located closer than forty feet
(40'), measured horizontally from the "shoreline", as defined in Section
12-819 of this title.
      2.   For rivers, streams, creeks or other similar flowing bodies of
water, excluding the water bodies identified in subsection A1 of this section,
no structure shall be located closer than seventy five feet (75'), measured
horizontally from the applicable natural or ordinary water mark of any stream
as shown on the NHD published by the United States geological survey, or by
actual land survey or field inspection.
   B.   Shoreline Setback Exceptions:
      1.   Placement of constructed trams, rails, uncovered steps, stairs or
walkways, any of which shall be four feet (4') or less in width and installed
to provide access to the shoreline, are permitted within the shoreline setback.
Such structures shall not be constructed in a manner that is parallel to the
shoreline that would create a boardwalk along the waterfront (except where
steep slopes require switchback designs).
      2.   For all parcels or lots where implementation of a seventy five foot
(75') shoreline setback would result in a remaining building envelope of less
than one hundred feet (100'), the shoreline setback may be reduced to a minimum
of forty feet (40') as needed to allow for a maximum building envelope depth of
one hundred feet (100'). The shoreline setback shall only be reduced to the
minimum necessary to achieve the one hundred foot (100') building envelope.
This exception shall apply only to dimensional constraints, but shall not apply
to topographical, environmental or other constraints. This exception shall not
apply to the following streams or rivers: Pack and Priest rivers; Hellroaring,
Twin, Lightning, Grouse, Rapid Lightning, Trestle and Cocolalla creeks. (Ord.
501, 11-18-2008)
12-712: FENCE RESTRICTIONS NEAR WATER:
   A.   Fences or walls, excluding seawalls, taller than thirty six inches
(36"), shall not be located closer than forty feet (40') from the shoreline.
   B.   Fences that are generally perpendicular to the shoreline may be
permitted per subsection A of this section, but may only be placed along
property lines. Fences in other locations within forty feet (40') of
shorelines, including those placed parallel to shorelines, shall be prohibited.
   C.   The fencing restrictions shall not apply to fences erected for the
pasturing of livestock. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-713: IMPERVIOUS SURFACE STANDARDS NEAR WATER:
The maximum "impervious surface", as defined in section
12-809 of this title, within "shore land" areas, as defined in section
12-819 of this title, which are defined as those lands extending landward for
two hundred feet (200') in all directions as measured on a horizontal plane
from any shoreline, shall be thirty five percent (35%).
   A.   Exceptions:
      1.   Submerged lands shall be excluded from the lot size calculations
above. Building location permits or building permit applications shall clearly
show all existing and proposed impervious surfaces within the shoreline area
and calculate the applicable percentage.
      2.   Developments may exceed these requirements by up to fifty percent
(50%), provided all structures are not located closer than seventy five feet
(75') from the shoreline. For example, the maximum percentage of impervious
area may be increased from thirty five percent (35%) of the shore land area to
fifty two and one-half percent (521/2%) of the shore land area, provided all
structures are not closer than seventy five feet (75') from the shoreline.
(Ord. 527, 5-16-2012)
12-714: SHORELINE VEGETATIVE BUFFER:
   A.   Areas: Vegetation buffer management areas include all lands within
forty feet (40') from shorelines.
   B.   Delineated On Final Plat: Shoreline vegetation buffer management areas
shall be delineated on the final plat of any subdivision. Applicants for shore
land subdivisions may be required to plant vegetation as provided in
appendix B of this title in shoreline vegetation buffer management areas prior
to final plat approval. Exceptions may be made for areas that contain no
cultivatable soil, such as pebble beach areas or rock outcroppings.
   C.   Water Quality Standards: To maintain water quality, reduce the
potential for nutrients entering the waterways and to protect fish and wildlife
habitat and drinking water standards, within shoreline vegetation buffer
management areas, one of the following standards shall be met:
      1.   Preferred option: Noninvasive vegetation shall be left intact in
existing natural condition within the shoreline vegetative buffer. The
vegetative buffer may be enhanced with the planting of additional native and
nonnative beneficial forbs, reeds, sedges, grasses, vines, shrubs, trees,
ferns, perennials or ground cover listed in
appendix B of this title.
      2.   Alternative option: Noninvasive vegetation shall be established and
maintained within the shoreline vegetative buffer. The vegetative buffer strip
shall consist of any combination of native and nonnative beneficial forbs,
reeds, sedges, grasses, vines, shrubs, trees, ferns, perennials or ground cover
listed in
appendix B of this title. The planting shall be sufficiently dense to provide
close growing vegetation designed to receive overland flow and hold and
stabilize soils.
   D.   Trees: In addition, in vegetative buffers adjacent to perennial
streams, trees shall be retained in accord with the following:
      1.   Standing trees, including conifers, hardwoods and snags, shall be
left within forty feet (40') of the ordinary high water mark on each side of
all perennial streams, in the following minimum numbers of standing trees per
one thousand feet (1,000') of stream on each side:

   20"+                                      4        -         -
 
         a.   Snags will be counted as standing trees in each diameter class if
snag height exceeds one and one-half (11/2) times the distance between the snag
and the stream's ordinary high water mark. Not more than fifty percent (50%) of
any class may consist of snags.
         b.   Trees should only be pruned up to one-third (1/3) of their height
in order to maintain optimum tree health. If defensible space is a high
priority, up to one-half (1/2) of the tree height may be pruned. (Ord. 501, 11-
18-2008)
   E.   Exceptions: The shoreline vegetation standards shall not apply to the
following:
      1.   Placement of trams, rails, uncovered steps, stairs, walkways four
feet (4') or less in width to provide access to the shoreline. These structures
shall not be constructed in a manner that is parallel to the shoreline that
would create a boardwalk along the waterfront, except where steep slopes
require switchback designs.
      2.   Replacement of lawn areas with native vegetation.
      3.   Removal of trees infected by a pathogen or attacked by insects that
threaten the surrounding trees.
      4.   Removal of trees that are potentially hazardous to public health or
safety due to the risk of falling, and structural instability cannot be
remedied due to nonmanmade, natural caused injury, such as weather or animal
related damage.
      5.   Shoreline property owners are encouraged to plant native vegetation
where none exists, in areas that contain cultivatable soils.
      6.   Exceptions may be made for areas that contain no cultivatable soil,
such as pebble beach areas or rock outcroppings. (Ord. 512, 1-6-2010)

12-723.1: GRADING STANDARDS:
   A.   The slope of cut surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the
intended use and shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1),
unless a design professional can demonstrate to the planning director
substantial evidence that steeper slopes are feasible, taking into account
safety, stability, erosion control, revegetation and overall water quality
impacts. Subsurface drainage shall be provided as necessary for stability. All
engineering reports are subject to review by the planning director or designee.
   B.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use and
shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), unless a design
professional can demonstrate to the planning director substantial evidence that
steeper slopes are feasible, taking into account safety, stability, erosion
control, revegetation and overall water quality impacts. Fill slopes shall not
be constructed on natural slopes of forty percent (40%) (21/2 horizontal to 1
vertical) or steeper, without special treatment or design. In addition, the toe
of fill slopes shall not be closer to the top of existing or planned downhill
cut slopes than the height of that cut (e.g., if an 8 foot cut is planned, the
toe of the uphill fill slope shall not be closer than 8 feet to the top of that
cut), unless the design professional has demonstrated that comparable stability
can be achieved with lesser setbacks.
   C.   Prior to placement of fill, the ground surface shall be prepared to
receive fill by removing vegetation, topsoil, forest duff and any other
unsuitable material. The area to receive fill shall be scarified to provide a
bond with the new fill. Fill shall not be placed until the area is prepared by
constructing a level or slightly insloped toe bench into competent material at
the base of the new fill. The planning director may waive the benching
requirement for minor fills which are not intended to support a road, driveway
or structure where the project design professional provides adequate evidence
the fill is not at risk for slippage or movement. In high risk areas where
slopes exceed fifteen percent (15%), or where highly erosive soils, seepage
areas or known areas of subsidence exist, the position, width and configuration
of the bench shall be determined by a design professional. Fill slopes and the
transition zone into natural terrain shall be configured to a generally smooth,
planar configuration so that runoff traverses the area as sheet flow and is not
concentrated. Fill material shall be composed of mineral soil that is free of
organic material. Roadway fills shall be placed in lifts and compacted to a
minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of the maximum density as determined by
the AASHTO T-99 or ASTM D-698 compaction procedure, or as specified in the
design professional's report.
   D.   Except where roads or driveways cross property lines, the tops and toes
of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from property boundaries one-half (1/
2) of the height of the slope with a minimum of five feet (5') and a maximum of
twenty feet (20'), unless a design professional has demonstrated to the
planning director that smaller setbacks provide a sufficient measure of safety
and stability for activities which may occur on adjacent property.
   E.   Terracing shall be required on all cut or fill slopes which exceed
fifty feet (50') in height. Spacing, width and drainage requirements of the
terrace shall be determined by a design professional. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)

12-726: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following performance standards shall be applicable to all design,
construction, implementation and maintenance of stormwater management systems
as required by this subchapter:
   A.   Treatment System: All stormwater from impervious areas shall be
directed to a stormwater management system identified in the handbook of best
management practices for stormwater management and erosion and sedimentation
control, and the stormwater management plan criteria and engineering standards,
prepared for the Panhandle health district and the interagency stormwater
committee by Kennedy Engineers, Spokane, WA, April 1992, or by implementation
of measures shown by a design professional to have an effective design
capability which equals or exceeds the standards of this subchapter. Stormwater
treatment systems shall be sized to hold and treat the first one-half inch (1/
2") of stormwater from impervious surfaces.
   B.   Collection And Conveyance System: No stormwater shall be collected or
concentrated, except within a channel or artificial watercourse protected
against erosion and containing energy dissipation measures to prevent erosion
on adjoining lands. Existing watercourses and streams shall be protected from
disturbance and erosion during site development. Any site development shall
preserve installed components of a stormwater management system if they exist.
All disturbed soils shall be protected from erosion during the course of
construction.
   C.   Disposal System: The disposal component of a stormwater management
system shall have the capacity to collect, convey and provide detention for a
twenty five (25) year design storm, without damage to the stormwater management
system or adjacent land and improvements.
   D.   For new subdivisions, planned unit developments, commercial and
industrial development and public projects, as set forth at section
12-720.2 of this subchapter, there shall be no increase in the peak rate of
runoff from the site when compared with the dissipation of stormwater from the
site prior to the start of any construction, for the first one-half inch (1/2")
of runoff. Within project boundaries, sufficient retention capacity shall be
constructed to retain stormwater flow from the first one-half inch (1/2").
   E.   Certification: Certification in the Panhandle stormwater and erosion
education program is encouraged for all contractors, developers, and excavators
involved in site disturbance activities within two hundred feet (200') of the
shoreline.
   F.   Weed, Pesticide Free Materials: Use of weed free and pesticide free
materials is encouraged when natural materials are called for in stormwater/
erosion control plans. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-727.1: INSPECTIONS:
   A.   Grading/Stormwater Management Plans: At a minimum, two (2) inspections
shall be required: 1) after erosion and sedimentation controls have been
installed, prior to ground disturbance; and 2) after the project has been
completed, including revegetation. For sites which are active during the
winter, two (2) additional inspections shall be required; 3) after the site has
been prepared for the winter (typically in September or October); and 4)
sometime in January or February to ensure that the erosion and sedimentation
control measures are adequate and maintained. The permittee's design
professional shall perform the inspections and submit inspection reports to the
planning director or designee.
   B.   Grading/Erosion Control Plans: A minimum of one inspection shall be
conducted by the planning department or the permittee's design professional.
The planning director shall determine whether additional inspections are
necessary based on the nature of the project. The permittee's design
professional (when applicable) or the planning director, or their designee,
shall conduct the inspections. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-727.2: GUARANTEE OF INSTALLATION:
   A.   For subdivisions, applicants must meet the requirements of section
12-644 of this title.
   B.   For all other developments requiring grading/stormwater management
plans, the applicant shall enter into a surety agreement with the county
agreeing to complete the improvements in accordance with surety agreement
conditions and the grading/stormwater management plans. A cash deposit,
certificate of deposit, corporate surety bond written by an insurance company
licensed in Idaho having a rating from AM Best & Company of "A" or better,
letter of credit issued and backed by a federal or state chartered bank, is
required equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the design professional's
estimated cost of construction of the improvements for the purpose of
guaranteeing completion of the work. Prior to release of the financial
guarantee, the developer's design professional shall submit a letter to the
county, approving the construction and certifying its completion.
   C.   If the required improvements have not been completed by the specified
date, the county may contract to have the work completed with the money from
the financial guarantee. The county may also take additional enforcement
measures as provided by law. (Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-728: VARIANCES, APPLICATION FOR, NOTIFICATION, PROCEDURE:
   A.   It shall be the duty of the planning director to determine when an
applicant's request for variation from the standards of this subchapter is
beyond the scope of an administrative exception as set forth at section
12-721.2 of this subchapter. The planning director shall inform the applicant
that the request must be processed as a variance, pursuant to
subchapter 2.3 of this title, and subject to the filing fee as set forth in
section
12-265 of this title.
   B.   An applicant for a variance shall show that the site character is
topographically, physiographically, vegetatively or geologically so unique that
the strict imposition of the standards of this subchapter would:
      1.   Defeat the purposes of this subchapter; or
      2.   Be less efficient in the collection, conveyance, detention,
retention or treatment of stormwaters than the proposed alternative; or
      3.   Create an undue hardship.
   C.   No variance shall be issued where such variance would impose a burden
upon adjacent landowners or divert untreated stormwaters onto adjacent lands.
(Ord. 501, 11-18-2008)
12-729: INVESTIGATION, VIOLATION, ENFORCEMENT, REMEDIES AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Investigation: The planning director shall cause investigations to be
made upon the request of the board or any public agency when any violation of
the provisions of this subchapter is alleged to have occurred. The planning
director shall make every effort to contact the property owner, and in no case
shall be authorized to conduct warrantless searches of private property in the
absence of consent from the property owner or occupier. The prosecuting
attorney may seek to obtain a search warrant upon a showing of probable cause
to suspect a violation or the existence of a reasonable program of inspection
of the terms of a stormwater management system.
   B.   Violation: Whenever the planning director determines that any person is
in violation of any provision of this subchapter, the planning director may
commence an administrative enforcement action by issuing a written notice of
violation. The notice of violation shall identify the alleged violation with
specificity and shall inform the person to whom it is directed of an
opportunity to confer with the planning director in a compliance conference. A
written response may be required within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the
notice of violation by the person to whom it is directed.
      1.   The planning director shall schedule a compliance conference which
shall provide an opportunity for the recipient of a notice of violation to
explain the circumstances of the alleged violation and, where appropriate, to
present a proposal for remedying damage caused by the alleged violation and
assuring future compliance.
      2.   If the parties cannot reach agreement for remedying damages and/or
assuring future compliance, the board of county commissioners may seek civil
enforcement through court action.
   C.   Any person determined in a civil enforcement action to have violated
any provision of this subchapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of three
hundred dollars ($300.00) per day, and each violation of each provision of this
subchapter may be deemed a separate violation.
   D.   The planning director, with the consent of the board, may pursue civil
action to compel future compliance or to enjoin any continuing violation. (Ord.

CHAPTER 9
CONDITIONAL ZONING DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
SECTION:
12-901: Purpose
12-902: Initiation Of Agreements
12-903: Jurisdiction
12-904: Time Limits
12-905: Form Of Agreements
12-906: Approval Of Agreements
12-907: Recordation Of Agreements
12-908: Duty To Comply With Terms Of Agreement
12-909: Modification Of Agreements
12-910: Termination Of Agreements
12-911: Enforcement Of Agreements
12-901: PURPOSE:
Conditional zoning development agreements are a discretionary tool that may be
used by the board as a condition of rezoning. Conditional zoning development
agreements allow a specific project with a specific use to be developed on one
or more parcels located in an area that is not currently zoned for the proposed
uses. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-902: INITIATION OF AGREEMENTS:
An agreement may be initiated with the consent of the applicant for the
rezoning of a particular parcel of land or collection of parcels of land
through the following methods:
   A.   On application by the applicant;
   B.   By recommendation of the director;
   C.   By recommendation of the Zoning Commission or a Hearing Examiner; or
   D.   As required by the board. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-903: JURISDICTION:
   A.   In the event that a hearing body finds that a conditional zoning
development agreement should be entered into, the hearing body shall retain
jurisdiction of the matter, defer consideration of the rezone applied for and
set a time limit for submittal of a proposed agreement. The hearing body shall
then proceed as specified herein.
   B.   In the event of a determination by the board that an agreement should
be entered into, the board may remand the matter to the hearing body to set a
time limit for submittal of a proposed agreement. The hearing body shall then
proceed as specified in this article. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-904: TIME LIMITS:
In the event of findings by the hearing body, or by requirement of the board to
submit an agreement, all time limits required by the provisions of Idaho Code
or this title may be stayed, modified, or extended upon affirmative decision of
the hearing body or vote of the board. The hearing body or the board may
establish time limits for submittal of a proposed agreement. Failure by the
applicant to comply with such time limits may be deemed to constitute just
cause for termination of conditional zoning development agreement proceedings
and denial of the zone change application. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-905: FORM OF AGREEMENTS:
An agreement shall be in the form required by the director. No agreement shall
be accepted by the department which does not include the following:
   A.   The legal name, title and addresses of the applicant, property owner
and/or others with a direct vested interest in the conditional zoning
development agreement and rezone request.
   B.   A legal description of the property that is subject of the rezone
request. Such legal description must be acceptable to the county.
   C.   An affidavit by the owner of the parcel agreeing to submission of the
use and property for an agreement upon the adoption of an order by the board
approving the requested rezone of the subject parcel.
   D.   The current use of the property for which the conditional zoning
development agreement is sought.
   E.   The proposed specific use of the property for which the conditional
zoning development agreement is sought and an explanation of how the proposed
use is permitted or conditionally permitted in the zone for which application
has been made.
   F.   A project summary report, which shall include:
      1.   A narrative description of the proposed density, amenities,
improvements or other uses sought, including, but not limited to: height,
setbacks, size, and location of all proposed structures or activities on the
property.
      2.   The estimated time of start and completion of all proposed
development activities. This may be simplified by devising a time line that
splits development activities into phases.
      3.   Plans for use and reuse of property after proposed project
completion.
      4.   A narrative description of physical and environmental effects,
constraints, or limitations of the proposed development, including
infrastructure demands, and proposals for mitigation of identified physical and
environmental effects, constraints or limitations.
      5.   Economic benefits gained or lost from proposed development.
      6.   Conceptual site plans, with some representation of scale showing the
approximate location of any proposed structures, perimeter buffer treatment (as
required), road improvements, conceptual drainage strategy, and other proposed
usage information. Exhibits on general soil types, topography, slope,
vegetation, drainages, and other pertinent land characteristics may also be
required.
   G.   Signed letters of application, approval, or preapproval from any
applicable federal, state, or local agencies involved in the permitting process
for the specific use proposed. Letters shall include any written agreements
made with agencies to perform specific action. If letters of application,
approval, or preapproval are not provided, acknowledgment and consent to comply
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and
standards shall be substituted.
   H.   A statement by the owner of the property that failure to comply with
the commitments in the agreement shall be deemed consent to rezone the property
to the preexisting zone. Rezoning of the subject parcel will occur at the time
of termination of the agreement and shall comply with the notice and hearing
procedures set forth in section 67-6509, Idaho Code. The costs of such rezone
shall be paid by the applicant, owner and/or developer.
   I.   Signatures of all applicants, owners, developers, or lawfully
authorized agents, shall be notarized, and in the case of lawfully authorized
agents, properly executed powers of attorney in a form acceptable to the
county's legal counsel shall be presented to the director and shall be made
part of the agreement.
   J.   A clause that the commitment shall run with the land and be binding on
the heirs, assigns, and successors in interest of the owner and/or developer.
   K.   Any other matter mutually agreeable to the parties. This may include,
but is not limited to, performance bonding or other fiscal guarantees. (Ord.
668, 5-11-2022)
12-906: APPROVAL OF AGREEMENTS:
The board may require an agreement to be executed to allow a rezone in order to
ensure implementation of the project as represented by the applicant and to
promote the general health, safety, comfort, convenience, and welfare of the
citizens of Bonner County. A conditional zoning development agreement shall not
allow a use of the property that is not a permitted use (whether of right or
with the appropriate permit) in the zone requested.
   A.   Conditional zoning development agreements may be recommended for
approval by the hearing body, and may be approved by the board, only after
public hearings complying with the notice and hearing procedures set forth in
section 67- 6509, Idaho Code and
subchapter 2.1 of this title.
   B.   The hearing body may recommend, and the board may add, conditions,
terms, duties or obligations to the development agreement. (Ord. 668, 5-11-
2022)
12-907: RECORDATION OF AGREEMENTS:
Following approval of a conditional zoning development agreement and adoption
of a companion ordinance rezoning the subject property by the board, the
agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder at the expense
of the property owner or applicant. The recorded agreement shall take effect
and be in force upon adoption of the approval order or publication of the
ordinance rezoning the subject property, whichever occurs later. The agreement,
and all conditions, terms, duties or obligations included therein, shall run
with the land and shall be considered to be continuing obligations of the
owner, all subsequent owners and any other person acquiring an interest in the
property. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-908: DUTY TO COMPLY WITH TERMS OF AGREEMENT:
Any owner, subsequent owner, and any other person acquiring an interest in
property that is restricted by an agreement adopted pursuant to this chapter,
shall comply with all terms, conditions, obligations and duties contained in
the agreement. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-909: MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS:
   A.   No substantial modification of an agreement may be made without
approval of the board unless the modification is required by changes in state
or federal laws, rules, or regulations. An agreement may be modified by the
board without a public hearing only upon an affirmative recommendation from the
hearing body that the proposed modification is not a substantial change to the
terms and conditions of the agreement, or that the modification is required by
changes in state or federal laws, rules, or regulations.
   B.   After recordation of a conditional zoning development agreement, any
party bound by the agreement may seek to modify the agreement. Requests for
modification of a conditional zoning development agreement shall comply with
the procedures set forth in this article, and may also follow any procedures
contained in the original agreement which are consistent with those set forth
in this article. The hearing body may recommend to the board, and the board may
approve, a substantial modification of a previously adopted agreement based
upon the following criteria:
      1.   A public hearing is held which complies with the notice and hearing
procedures set forth in section 67-6509, Idaho Code and
subchapter 2.1 of this title.
      2.   A finding that the circumstances surrounding the agreement currently
in effect have changed and that the proposed modification will:
         a.   Preserve the enjoyment of a substantial property right of the
owner;
         b.   Not be detrimental to the public welfare; and
         c.   Not be injurious to other property in the surrounding
neighborhood. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-910: TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS:
   A.   A conditional zoning development agreement may be terminated by the
board without the consent of the breaching party for failure to comply with any
term, condition, obligation or duty contained in the agreement. Such
termination shall take place after a public hearing on the termination, at
which time testimony shall be taken to establish noncompliance with the
agreement. The public hearing shall comply with the notice and hearing
procedures set forth in section 67-6509, Idaho Code and
subchapter 2.1 of this title.
   B.   A conditional zoning development agreement may contain termination
procedures, including, without limitation, notification of the persons bound by
the agreement of the alleged violation and establishing a reasonable time to
remedy the violation prior to the initiation of termination proceedings.
   C.   Upon termination of the agreement, the property which was the subject
of the agreement shall revert to the zone applicable as of the date of
submittal of the rezone request which resulted in the adoption of the
agreement. If no such zone then exists, the zone then in effect which most
closely conforms to the characteristics and requirements of the prior existing
zone, as determined by the director, shall apply. At that time, all uses of the
property which are not permitted within the subsequently applied zone following
termination of the agreement shall immediately cease. The property owner may
apply for the appropriate permit for any use that is permitted within the
subsequently applied zone upon approval of such permit.
   D.   A conditional zoning development agreement shall stipulate that the
costs incurred to rezone the property upon termination of the agreement be paid
by the applicant, owner and/or developer of the property. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)
12-911: ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENTS:
Conditional zoning development agreements may be enforced by the county through
any means deemed to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, specific
enforcement, injunctive relief, or damages for violation of any provision of
this article or of any agreement approved pursuant to the provisions of this
article. The foregoing enforcement options available to the county shall not be
deemed exclusive. (Ord. 668, 5-11-2022)

renovation of existing private roads for subdivisions, in Bonner County. All
construction shall conform to the standards set forth in this manual.
   A.   The Board of County Commissioners is authorized to waive requirements
of
appendix A upon satisfaction of the criteria of this section. The purpose of
granting a waiver under the provisions of these regulations shall be to ensure
that an applicant is not unduly burdened as opposed to merely inconvenienced by
the Private Road Standards. The Board shall not approve any waiver(s) except
finding that all of the following apply:
      1.   The granting of the waiver will not result in impacts that are
detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other
property.

standards and requirements of these regulations.
      3.   A practical hardship, or unnecessary and unreasonable expense, would
result from strict compliance with the foregoing regulations.
      4.   The purpose of these Private Road Standards may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, or where such requirements are
redundant and clearly unnecessary for the land division in a particular area.

traffic volume* of less than two hundred (200) vehicle trips per day, and in an
area zoned for lot or parcel sizes of five (5) acres or greater on the official
Bonner County zoning map. Note: Private roads are not maintained by Bonner
County.
* Projected traffic volumes to be based on ten (10) vehicle trips per day per
household over the design life of the road (usually 20 years).
New private roads shall have a minimum roadway width, travelway width and
surfacing based on the classification of the road as follows:
 
Classification Of Road       Roadway Width Travelway Width Hard Surfaced
Private Access Roads                                      
   High density private ro26 feet       20 feet         yes
   Standard private road  22 feet       20 feet         yes
   Low volume private road22 feet       20 feet         no
 
Hard surfaced roads shall have a minimum surfacing of a two (2) shot
application of light bituminous surface treatment.
   B.   Where fire hydrants are located along the roadway, the minimum width of
the travelway shall be twenty six feet (26'). This may be accomplished by
construction of a turnout providing an overall travelway width of twenty six
feet (26') and forty feet (40') in length at the hydrant location.
   2.6 Road Intersections
All new private roads which intersect new or existing roads and rights of way/
easements shall intersect at an angle which is between eighty (80) and one
hundred degrees (100o), and as close to ninety degrees (90o) as is possible.
The edge of the road surfaces shall be connected with a curve having a minimum
radius of twenty eight feet (28'). All new roads intersecting a public right of
way shall be constructed or reconstructed to meet the current Bonner County
road standards.
   2.7 Visibility At Intersections
At intersections, a minimum clear sight triangle shall be maintained as
illustrated on plate 2, sight triangle at intersections, of the current Bonner
County road standards manual. It shall be the responsibility of the developer/
adjacent landowner to maintain the clear sight triangle at all times.
SECTION 3: ROAD CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES
   3.1 Clearing And Grubbing
Prior to the start of road construction, clearing of the entire width of the
right of way/easement shall be completed. All materials removed by clearing or
grubbing shall be properly disposed of in compliance with state and local
requirements. All denuded areas shall be erosion protected as specified in the
stormwater and erosion control plan if applicable.
   3.2 Erosion Control
During road construction, erosion control measures shall be installed and
maintained to minimize soil erosion from disturbed sites. Permanent erosion
control measures shall be included in all road designs, with design guidance
from the handbook of best management practices for stormwater management and
erosion and the Idaho standards for public works construction. Refer to title
12,
subchapter 7.2 of the Bonner County Revised Code for stormwater management and
erosion control plan requirements.
   3.3 Subgrade
   A.   The subgrade shall consist of the native materials remaining after duff
(organic material) and topsoil have been removed and suitable underlying road
construction material, or to a depth as necessary to allow placement of
sufficient depth of subbase material. The extent of the excavation necessary to
expose the subgrade shall be determined by the project engineer. Soil and
compaction tests are required to document the acceptability for construction.
All testing shall be at the expense of the developer.
   B.   In solid rock excavation, the solid rock shall be excavated six inches
(6") below the finished subgrade elevation and backfilled with approved
granular material.
   C.   Unstable subgrade conditions shall be remedied by over excavation and
backfilling with approved material under the direction of the project engineer
and/or placement of appropriate geosynthetic materials to meet the required
vehicular support criteria.
   D.   Subgrade shall be prepared as necessary to allow overlying road
material to be constructed in accordance with these specifications.
   E.   Prior to placing any ballast on the subgrade, the project engineer is
responsible for ensuring that all testing, required inspections and standards
outlined herein are adhered to.
   3.4 Ballast
   A.   All underground utilities and conduits crossing the road shall be
installed before placement of ballast material.
   B.   Pit run gravel or fractured rock I shall be used for the ballast
material. Ballast material shall have a sand equivalent of not less than thirty
(30), and which meets the following gradations:
 
Sieve Size Percent Passing
6 inch     100
3 inch     98 - 100
2 inch     75 - 100
1 inch     40 - 80
#4         25 - 60
#200       5 - 12
 
   C.   The ballast material shall be placed in loose six inch (6") to nine
inch (9") lifts and shall be compacted using mechanical methods to at least
ninety five percent (95%) of the ASTM D-698 standard proctor density.
   D.   Prior to placing any top course material on the ballast, the project
engineer is responsible for ensuring that all testing, required inspections and
standards outlined herein are adhered to.
   E.   All culvert installations crossing the roadway shall be installed
before any base material is placed.
   F.   Recommended ballast thickness and top course thickness:
The following charts may be used by the project engineer to assist in the soils
classification and to determine the depth of the minimum required ballast and
top course material. The intent is to design a roadway section capable of
providing an all-weather road for a seventy eight thousand (78,000) pound fire
apparatus.

14-102: Findings Of Fact
14-103: Statement Of Purpose
14-104: Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
14-101: AUTHORITY:
The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code §§ 46-1020
through 46-1024, authorizes local governments to adopt floodplain management
ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum floodplain development
standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human life, health, and
property. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Bonner County, Idaho does
hereby ordain as follows: (Ord. 565, 5-3-2017; amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-2023)
14-102: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Bonner County are subject to periodic
inundation that results in:
      1.   Loss of life and property;
      2.   Health and safety hazards;
      3.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
      4.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection;
and
      5.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
   C.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management. (Ord. 565, 5-3-2017; amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-2023)
14-103: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The purpose of this ordinance is to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life, health, safety and property;
   B.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
   C.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
   D.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   E.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   F.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   G.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 565, 5-3-2017; amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-
2023)
14-104: OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purpose, this ordinance includes methods and
provisions to:
   A.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
   C.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
   D.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
   E.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 565, 5-3-2017;
amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-2023)

         A general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to
         FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment
         (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill
         (LOMR-F)
         1.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): an official amendment, by letter, to an
         effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
         property’s location in relation to the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). LOMAs are
         usually issued because a property has been inadvertently mapped as being in the
         floodplain but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood elevation.
         2.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA’s modification to an effective Flood
         Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) or both.
         LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect
         the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
LETTER   the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective Base Flood
OF MAP   Elevations (BFEs), or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The LOMR officially
CHANGE   revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map
(LOMC):  (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and when appropriate,
         includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by
         an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
         3.   Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA’s modification of the
         Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) based
         on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The LOMR-F does
         not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
         4.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to
         whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the
         minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special
         flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
         (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and approval of certified
         as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to
         revise the effective FIRM. Building Permits and/or Flood Development Permits cannot
         be issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
         A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed
LEVEE:   according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or divert the flow
         of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE    A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
SYSTEM:  structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and
         operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST
ADJACENT The lowest point of the ground level next to the structure. Refer to the FEMA
GRADE    Elevation Certificate for LAG related to building elevation information.

         The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or
         flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access
LOWEST   or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s
FLOOR:   lowest floor; Provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the
         structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44

14-219: DEFINITIONS - S:
SPECIAL FLOOD The land in the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or
HAZARD AREA   greater chance of flooding in any given year. For purposes of these regulations,
(SFHA):       the term “special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase
              “area of special flood hazard”.
              Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
              issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
              rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
              the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
              construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
              the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
              stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
START OF      Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
CONSTRUCTION: grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
              walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
              foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
              installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
              occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
              improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
              wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
              alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE:    A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
              principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
              Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
              structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent (50%)
SUBSTANTIAL   of its market value before the damage occurred. See definition of “substantial
DAMAGE:       improvement”. Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a
              structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of
              repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25
              percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
              Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
              the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent (50%) of the market value of the
              structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term
              includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the
              actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
SUBSTANTIAL   1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
IMPROVEMENT:  state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
              identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
              necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
              2.   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will
              not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure” and
              the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this ordinance. (Ord.

      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   D.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
title, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this title.
   E.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage.
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance.
   F.   The Planning Director or designee shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of Idaho upon request.
   G.   Conditions for Variances:
      1.   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if the
variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   H.   A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or sites,
hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage
facilities that are located in Special Flood Hazard Areas provided that all of
the following conditions are met.
      1.   The use serves a critical need in the community.
      2.   No feasible location exists for the use outside the Special Flood
Hazard Area.
      3.   The lowest floor of any structure is elevated or floodproofed to at
least the Flood Protection Elevation.
      4.   The use complies with all other applicable Federal, State and local
laws.
   I.   Bonner County will notify the State NFIP Coordinator of the Idaho
Department of Water Resources of its intention to grant a variance at least
thirty (30) calendar days prior to granting the variance.
   J.   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal
such decision to the Court, as provided in Idaho Code 67-6535. (Ord. 565, 5-3-
2017; amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-2023)

14-507: Critical Facilities
14-501: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the following provisions are required:
   A.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and other development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure.
   B.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and other development
shall be constructed with flood damage-resistant materials as defined herein,
and with utility equipment resistant to flood damage, in accordance with FEMA
Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, or as
hereafter amended, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   C.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and other development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
   D.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the Flood Protection Elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
   E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   F.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   G.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   H.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved
structures, which is below the lowest floor shall:
      1.   be constructed entirely of flood damage-resistant materials to at
least to the Flood Protection Elevation; and

coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
         f.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   I.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure,
which is in compliance with the provisions of this title, shall meet the
requirements of “new construction” as contained in this title.
   J.   Nothing in this title shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a lawfully constructed building or structure legally existing on
the effective date of this title and located totally or partially within the
floodway, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below
the Flood Protection Elevation in the floodway, or stream setback, and provided
that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other
requirements of this title.
   K.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in BCRC
14-405.H. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an

Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
   P.   When a structure or development is partially located in a Special Flood
Hazard Area, the entire structure or development shall meet the requirements of
this Title, including but not limited to the standards for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   Q.   When a structure or development is located in multiple flood hazard
zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the
provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest Base
Flood Elevation (BFE) shall apply. (Ord. 565, 5-3-2017; amd. Ord. 690, 4-18-
2023)
14-502: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has
been provided, as set forth in BCRC
14-302 or
14-504, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of BCRC
14-501, are required:
   A.   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the
Base Flood Elevation, as defined in Chapter 2 of this title, except as provided
in this section. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject
to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or licensed architect, and must meet or exceed
the following minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings located on different walls of the
structure, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or
devices; provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      4.   All structural and nonstructural building materials at or below the
flood protection elevation shall be flood damage-resistant materials. A “flood
damage-resistant material” is defined as any building material capable of
withstanding direct and prolonged contact of at least seventy-two (72) hours
with floodwaters without sustaining significant damage, meaning any damage
requiring more than low cost cosmetic repair such as painting.
      5.   In unnumbered A zones where a base flood elevation has not been
established, the applicant may submit a site-specific engineering analysis to
determine BFE, or plans shall be provided demonstrating the structure shall be
elevated at minimum two feet (2') above highest adjacent grade (HAG) at the
building site or to the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE) whichever is higher,
as defined in Chapter 2 of this Title.
   B.   Non-Residential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one
foot above the Base Flood Elevation, as defined in Chapter 2 of this title.
Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 may be floodproofed to one
foot above the Base Flood Elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all
areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the Flood Protection Elevation are watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effect of buoyancy. For AH and AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be
in accordance with BCRC
14-506.B. A licensed professional engineer or licensed architect shall certify
that the floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Planning Director or designee as set
forth in BCRC
14-403.C., along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance
plan.
   C.   Below Grade Crawl Space Construction for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings: In addition to the standards provided herein, below grade crawl
space construction shall be designed and certified by a licensed engineer or
licensed architect to meet the following:
      1.   The interior grade of the crawl space below the base flood elevation
shall not be greater than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent exterior
grade.
      2.   The height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the
interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation
wall, shall not exceed four feet (4') at any point.
      3.   An adequate drainage system shall be designed and installed to
remove floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within seventy-two
(72) hours after a flood event. The system may include perforated pipes,
drainage tiles, gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical
means, and shall meet the minimum construction practices outlined by the
national flood insurance program guidelines.
      4.   Below grade crawl spaces are prohibited at sites where the velocity
of floodwaters exceeds five feet (5') per second, as established by the flood
insurance study.
      5.   All building utility systems within the crawl space shall be
elevated above base flood elevation or be designed so that floodwaters cannot
enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.
Ductwork shall be placed above the base flood elevation or shall be sealed from
floodwaters.
      6.   All structural and nonstructural building materials at or below the
flood protection elevation shall be flood resistant material as defined herein.
      7.   Below grade crawl spaces constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
However, applicants who construct buildings that have below grade crawl spaces
are hereby advised that such buildings will have higher flood insurance
premiums than buildings that have crawl spaces with interior elevations at or
above the lowest adjacent grade.
   D.   Manufactured Homes.
      1.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is no lower than the Flood Protection
Elevation, as defined in Chapter 2 of this title.
      2.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the Idaho Division of Building Safety’s “Idaho Manufactured
Home Installation Standard” in accordance with Idaho Code § 44-2201(2).
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      3.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of BCRC
14-501.H.
      4.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within Special Flood Hazard Areas. This plan
shall be filed with and approved by the Planning Director or designee and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
   E.   Additions/Improvements.
      1.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure; or
         b.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      2.   Additions to post-FIRM structures that are a substantial improvement
with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in
the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
      3.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
         c.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      4.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a four (4) year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started, must
comply with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure,
the four (4) year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair
of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this title.
If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
requirement does not, however, include either:
         a.   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         b.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   F.   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall be either:
      1.   Temporary Placement:
         a.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
      2.   Permanent Placement.
         a.   Recreational vehicles that do not meet the limitations of
Temporary Placement shall meet all the requirements for new construction, as
set forth in BCRC
14-501.
   G.   Temporary Non-Residential Structures. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must

14-506: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO, AH, AR/AO, OR AR/AH):
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in BCRC
14-302, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to BCRC
14-501 and
14-502, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
   A.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of
one (1) foot, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two(2) feet above
the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   B.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed

15-101: SHORT TITLE:
This Chapter 1 of Title 15 shall be known and may be cited as the Bonner County
Fire District Development Impact Fee Ordinance. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-102: FINDINGS:
The Board of Bonner County Commissioners finds that:
   A.   Within unincorporated Bonner County, the County is experiencing
considerable growth and development.
   B.   The new growth and development occurring within unincorporated Bonner
County will place ever-increasing demands on any Fire District whose boundaries
include land in unincorporated Bonner County to provide, improve and expand
existing public safety facilities to serve that new growth and development and
the tax revenues generated from that new growth and development often does not
generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements and expansion
of the public safety facilities to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. Those users that create the increased demand should bear their
proportionate share of the cost of public safety facilities needed to serve the
new growth and development.
   C.   Fire Districts organized pursuant to Idaho Code § 31-1401 et seq. do
not have authority to make and adopt ordinances as a method of carrying out
their statutory duties.
   D.   The Idaho Development Impact Fee Act (Act) at Idaho Code § 67-8201 et
seq. requires an entity to adopt an ordinance in order to impose and collect
development impact fees.
   E.   The Act does provide, pursuant to Idaho Code § 67-8204A, in
circumstances where the County and the Fire District are both affected by the
considerable growth and development as is occurring within the County, that the
County and the Fire District may enter into an intergovernmental agreement for
the purpose of agreeing to collect and expend Development Impact Fees for
System Improvements which provides for a new funding mechanism for those System
Improvements Costs incurred by the Fire District to meet the demand and growth
occurring within the County and which promotes and accommodates orderly growth
and development and protects the public health, safety and general welfare of
the people, residential and non-residential establishments within the
boundaries of the County.
   F.   The County has statutory authority to make and adopt ordinances
pursuant to Idaho Code § 31-714. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-103: AUTHORITY:
This Chapter 1 of Title 15 is enacted pursuant to the County's general police
powers, its authority to enact ordinances, and its authority as provided by the
Act and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho to impose and collect
development impact fees on behalf of the Fire District; and the County's and
the Fire District's authority to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement as
provided for in Idaho Code § 67-8204A when jointly affected by growth and
development for the purpose of agreeing to impose, collect and expend
Development Impact Fees in order for new growth and development to pay their
proportionate share of the cost of public facilities to serve that new growth
and development. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-104: APPLICABILITY:
This Chapter shall apply to the Development of property located within the
boundaries of the Northside Fire District and; Spirit Lake Fire Protection
District in unincorporated Bonner County. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021; amd. Ord. 679,
9-21-2022)
15-105: PURPOSE:
The intent of this Chapter 1 of Title 15 is to ensure that new residential and
non-residential development bears a proportionate share of the cost of System
Improvements; to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost
of such System Improvements required to accommodate new Development; and to
ensure that funds collected from new Development are actually used for System
Improvements in accordance with the Act. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)

15-502: Request For Certification Requirements
15-501: REQUEST FOR WRITTEN CERTIFICATION:
A Fee Payer may request a written certification of the impact fee schedule or
individual assessment which shall establish the impact fee for that
Development. Such certification shall establish the Fire District Impact Fee so
long as there is no material change to the particular Development as identified
in the individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule. A
certification may be applied for in the manner established in
15-502. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-502: REQUEST FOR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Requests for certification shall be in writing and made to the Fire District
Administrator. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request, the Fire
District Administrator shall issue a written certification of the amount of the
Fire District Impact Fee due for the proposed Development. The certification

ARTICLE F: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT
SECTION:
15-601: Individual Assessment
15-601: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT:
In lieu of calculating the amount of the Fire District Impact Fee using the
impact fee schedule in Article C of this Chapter 1 of Title 15, an individual
assessment of Impact Fees is permitted when the Fee Payer demonstrates by clear
and convincing evidence that the established Impact Fee is inappropriate.
   A.   Individual Assessment Process: A Fee Payer may file a written request
for an individual assessment of the Development by the Fire District with the
Fire District Administrator prior to the receipt of a Building Location Permit
or other necessary approvals or entitlements from Bonner County. A request for
an individual assessment process shall involve consideration of studies, data,
and any other relevant information submitted by the Fee Payer to adjust the
amount of the Fire District Impact Fee. If a Fee Payer files a request for the
use of an individual assessment, the Fee Payer shall be responsible for
retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual assessment that
complies with the requirements of this Chapter 1 of Title 15, at the Fee
Payer's expense. The Fee Payer shall bear the burden of proving by clear and
convincing evidence that the resulting individual assessment is a more accurate
measure of its proportionate share of the cost of System Improvements, based on
the Fire District's adopted Level of Service, than the development impact fees
that would otherwise be due pursuant to the fee schedule.
   1.   Each individual assessment request and supporting documentation
submitted by the Fee Payer shall be based on the same level of service
standards and unit costs for System Improvements used in the Fire District's
Capital Improvements Plan, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost)
methodology, and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions
used.
      2.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the Fire District
Administrator may then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by
the Fire District Administrator as the basis for calculating the Fire District
Impact Fee. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or acceptance with
modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is a more accurate
measure of demand for System Improvements element(s) created by the proposed
Development, or the costs of those facilities, than the applicable fee shown in
the fee schedule.
      3.   The Fire District Administrator shall issue a written decision
within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed request for individual
assessment together with all supporting information from the Fee Payer, so as
not to unreasonably delay the Developer's (Fee Payer's) subsequent applications
to the County for Building Location Permits.
      4.   The decision by the Fire District Administrator on an application
for an individual assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of
the Fire District Impact Fee, shall specify the System Improvement(s) for which
the Fire District Impact Fee is intended to be used, and shall include an
explanation of those factors identified in Idaho Code § 67-8207.
      5.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the Fire District Administrator then the Fire District Impact
Fee due under this Chapter 1 of Title 15 for such Development shall be
calculated according to such individual assessment.
      6.   The Fire District Administrator shall provide notice of final
determination of an individual assessment to the Fee Payer and Bonner County.

15-703: Valuation Of Credit At Present Value
15-704: When Credits Become Effective
15-705: Credit Request Process
15-701: CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
When a Developer or their predecessor in title or interest has constructed
System Improvements of the same category as a Fire District's Capital
Improvements Element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards the
completion of System Improvements of the same category as the Fire District's
Capital Improvements Element, and the Fire District has accepted such
construction, contribution or dedication, the Fire District shall issue a
credit against the Fire District's Impact Fees otherwise due for the same Fire
District's Capital Improvements Element in connection with the proposed
Development, as set forth in this Article G, credit shall be issued regardless
of whether the contribution or dedication to System Improvements was required
by the Fire District as a condition of Development Approval or was offered by
the Developer and accepted by the Fire District in writing, and regardless of
whether the contribution or dedication was contributed by the Developer or by a
local improvement District controlled by the Developer. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-702: CREDITS AGAINST FEE:
Credits against a Fire District Impact Fee shall not be given for: (a) Project
Improvements; or (b) any construction, contribution or dedication not agreed to
in writing by the Fire District prior to commencement of the construction,
contribution, or dedication. Credits issued for one Fire District Capital
Improvements Element may not be used to reduce Fire District Impact Fees due
for a different capital improvement. No credits shall be issued for System
Improvements contributed or dedicated prior to the effective date of this
Chapter 1 of Title 15. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-703: VALUATION OF CREDIT AT PRESENT VALUE:
   A   Land: Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the Fee Payer's
option, be valued at the present value of: (a) one hundred percent (100%) of
the most recent assessed value for such land as shown in the records of the
county assessor; or (b) that fair market value established by a private
appraiser acceptable to the Fire District in an appraisal paid for by the Fee
Payer.
   B.   Improvements: Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall be valued by the Fire District at the present value
of such improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications,
and construction cost estimates submitted by the Fee Payer to the Fire
District. The Fire District Administrator shall determine the amount of credit
due based on the information submitted, or, if it determines that such
information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or
construction costs acceptable to the Fire District as a more accurate measure
of the value of the offered System Improvements to the Fire District. (Ord.
648, 9-22-2021)
15-704: WHEN CREDITS BECOME EFFECTIVE:
   A.   Land: Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the Fire District in a form acceptable to the
Fire District, at no cost to the Fire District, and has been accepted by the
Fire District. Upon request of the Fee Payer, the Fire District shall issue a
letter stating the amount of credit available.
   B.   Improvements: Approved credits for acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall generally become effective when (a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the Fire District, (b)
a suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the
Fire District, and (c) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding,
and acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the Fire District and the state of Idaho. Upon request of the
Fee Payer, the Fire District shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit
available. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-705: CREDIT REQUEST PROCESS:
   A.   Request: In order to obtain a credit against a Fire District Impact Fee
otherwise due, a Fee Payer shall submit to the Fire District Administrator a
written offer of request to dedicate to the Fire District specific parcels of
qualifying land or a written offer to contribute or construct specific System
Improvements to the Fire District Capital Facilities in accordance with all
applicable State or County design and construction standards, and shall
specifically request a credit against the type of Fire District Impact Fee for
which the land dedication or System Improvements is offered.
   B.   Review: After receipt of the written offer of request for credit, the
Fire District Administrator shall review the request and determine whether the
land or System Improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of
providing Fire District Capital Facilities by an amount at least equal to the
value of the credit. If the Fire District Administrator determines that the
offered credit satisfies that criteria and will be acceptable to the Fire
District's Board of Commissioners, then the credit shall be issued. The Fire
District shall complete its review and determination of an application within
thirty (30) days after receipt of an application for credit.
   C.   Credits Exceeding Fee Amounts Due: If the credit due to a Fee Payer
pursuant to Section
15-703 exceeds the Fire District Impact Fee that would otherwise be due from
the Fee Payer pursuant to the Chapter 1 of Title 15 (whether calculated through
the Impact Fee schedule in Article C of this Chapter 1 or through an individual
assessment), the Fee Payer may choose to receive such credit in the form of
either: (a) a credit against future Fire District Impact Fee due for the same
System Improvements; or (b) a reimbursement from Fire District Impact Fees paid
by future Development that impacts the System Improvements contributed or
dedicated by the Fee Payer. Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the
Fee Payer, the Fire District shall be under no obligation to use any of the
Fire District funds - other than Fire District Impact Fees paid by other
Development for the same System Improvements - to reimburse the Fee Payer for
any credit in excess of Fire District Impact Fees that are due.
   D.   Written Agreement Required: If credit or reimbursement is due to the
Fee Payer pursuant to this Article G, the Fire District shall enter into a
written agreement with the Fee Payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the System Improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount,
time and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years.
   E.   The Fire District Administrator's determination on the written offer of
request for credit shall be provided to the Fee Payer and the County. (Ord.

SECTION:
15-801: General Provisions
15-802: Methodology; Proportionate Methodology
15-803: Proportionate Share Determination
15-801: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Accounting Principles: The calculation of the Fire District Impact Fee
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee
may result in an incidental benefit to owners or Developers within the service
area other than the Fee Payer.
   B.   Levels Of Service: The Fire District Impact Fee shall be calculated on
the basis of levels of service for Public Facilities in the adopted Capital
Improvement Plan that are applicable to existing Development as well as new
growth and Development. The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement
of new or existing Public Facilities for which the Fire District Impact Fee is
imposed must be attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new
Development. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-802: METHODOLOGY; PROPORTIONATE METHODOLOGY:
The Fire District Impact Fee shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost
of the System Improvements determined in accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8207,
as it may be amended. Fire District Impact Fees shall be based on actual System
Improvements Costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. The amount of the
Fire District Impact Fee shall be calculated using the methodology contained in
the adopted Capital Improvements Plan. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-803: PROPORTIONATE SHARE DETERMINATION:
   A.   The Fire District Impact Fee shall be based on a reasonable and fair
formula or method under which the Fire District Impact Fee imposed does not
exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the
Fire District in the provision of System Improvements to serve the new
Development. The proportionate share is the costs attributable to the new
Development after the Fire District considers the following:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land or construction of System Improvements;
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
      3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the Fire
District to System Improvements; and
      4.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.
   B.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of System
Improvements to be paid by the Developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the Fire District and accounted for in the calculation of the
Fire District's Impact Fee:
      1.   The costs of existing System Improvements within the Service area;
      2.   The means by which existing System Improvements have been financed;
      3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements Costs through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements Costs
through Developer or landowner contributions;
      4.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing System Improvements in the future;
      5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area;
      6.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development;
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)

15-902: Process
15-901: INITIAL DETERMINATION:
A Fire District may make an initial determination that Development may impose
an Extraordinary Impact due to a review of a development application
transmitted by the County to a Fire District pursuant to the County's zoning
authority under the Local Land Use Planning Act, Chapter 65, Title 67, Idaho
Code. (Ord. 648, 9-22-2021)
15-902: PROCESS:
   A.   Within thirty (30) days after Fire District Administrator's receipt
from the County of the development application, the Fire District Administrator
will notify the Fee Payer and the County of the Fire District Administrator's
initial determination that the Development may impose an Extraordinary Impact.
Such notice shall include that a supplemental study, at the Fee Payer's expense
will be required.
   B.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a Development with
Extraordinary Impact, the Fire District Administrator shall meet with the Fee
Payer to discuss whether the Fee Payer wants to: (a) pay for the supplemental
study necessary to determine the System Improvements Costs related to the
proposed Development; (b) modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary
Impact; or (c) withdraw the application for certification, or Development
approval.
   C.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed Development's proportionate share of System Improvements
Costs, then the Fire District and the Fee Payer shall jointly select an
individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The Fee
Payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the Fee Payer agrees to a longer time.
   D.   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to: (a) pay
the proportionate share of System Improvements Costs documented by the
supplemental study; or (b) modify the proposed Development to reduce such
costs; or (c) withdraw the application. The Fire District Administrator shall
notify the County of the Fee Payer's choice within fifteen (15) days of the Fee
Payer's decision.
   E.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay the System Improvements Costs documented
in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to writing between
the Fire District and the Fee Payer prior to review and consideration of any
application for any Development approval or Building Location Permits related
to the proposed Development. The Fire District Administrator shall provide a
copy of the agreement to the County within fifteen (15) days after the
agreement has been signed by both parties.
   F.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the proportionate
share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental study,
nothing in this Chapter 1 of Title 15 shall obligate the County to approve
Development that results in an Extraordinary Impact to the Fire District. (Ord.

development size or number of Service Units more than ten percent (10%) higher
than that reflected in the original Building Location Permit, then the Fire

proportionate share; or
      2.   Discontinue the collection of any Fire District Impact Fees until

Payer shall be refunded by the Fire District within thirty (30) days after the
Fire District's acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the
