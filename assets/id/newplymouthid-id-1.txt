The words, "written" and "in writing" may include printing. Provided, that
these rules of construction shall not be applied to any Section of the
Municipal Code which contains any express provision excluding such construction
or where the subject matter or content may be repugnant thereto.
1-1-5: DEFINITIONS:
The term "personal property" includes every description of money, goods,
chattels, effects, evidence of rights in action, and all written instruments by
which any pecuniary obligation, right or title to property is created,
acknowledged, transferred, increased, defeated, discharged or diminished, and
every right or interest therein.
The word "streets" includes alleys, lanes, courts, boulevards, public ways,
public squares, public places and sidewalks.
The word "owner" applied to a building or land shall include any part owner,
joint owner, tenant in common, joint tenant or lessee of the whole or of a part
of such building or land.
The word "tenant" or "occupant" applied to a building or land shall include any
person who occupies the whole or any part of such building or land whether
alone or with others.
Words prohibiting anything being done, except in accordance with a license or
permit or authority from a board or officer, shall be construed as giving such
board or officer power to license or permit or authorize such thing to be done.
The word "officer" shall include officers and boards in charge of departments
and members of such boards. Such reference as use of the word "City" shall mean
this Municipality. "Clerk," "Treasurer" or other officer titles used shall mean
City Clerk, City Treasurer of other City officer as the use may be applicable.
The term "wilfully" when applied to the intent with which an act is done or

omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to
injure another, or to acquire an advantage.
The term "neglect," "negligence," "negligent," and "negligently" imports a want
of such attention to the nature or probable consequences of the act or omission
as a prudent man ordinarily bestows in acting in his own concern.
The term "knowingly" imports only a knowledge that the facts exist which brings
the act or omission within the provisions of these ordinances. It does not
require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of such act or omission.
1-1-6: INTERPRETATIONS:
In the determination of the provisions of each Section of the Municipal Code
the following rules shall be observed:
   (A)   Intent to Defraud: Whenever an intent to defraud is required in order
to constitute an offense, it shall be sufficient if an intent appears to
defraud any person.
   (B)   Liability of Employers and Agents: When the provisions of any Section
of the Municipal Code prohibit the commission of an act, not only the person
actually doing the prohibited act or omitting the directed act, but also the
employer and all other persons concerned with or in aiding or abetting the said
person shall be guilty of the offense described and liable to the penalty set
forth.
1-1-7: PENALTIES:
In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by
different clauses or sections of the official Municipal Code the prosecuting
officer may elect under which to proceed; but not more than one (1) recovery
shall be had against the same person for the same offense; provided, that the
revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty
so as to bar any other penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a
breach of any Section or provision of the Municipal Code, and there shall be no
fine or penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of the
general penalty clause shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during or on which a breach or violation occurs or
continues.
1-1-8: LIABILITY OF OFFICERS:
No provision of the official Municipal Code designating the duties of any
officer or employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee
liable for any fine or penalty provided for a failure to perform such duty,
unless the intention of the Council to impose such fine or penalty on such
officer or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the Section
creating the duty.

council. The standing animal control board shall consist of a council member, a

shall meet as often as may be directed by the mayor or city council, but not

review the actions of any animal and make a determination that an animal is
vicious or is not vicious, the animal control board shall be increased to
include the owner of the animal subject to a review and a person who has been
damaged by the animal.

manner that it should be declared vicious, the person wishing to have the
animal declared vicious shall file a written request with the city clerk asking
that the city convene the animal control board to review the actions of the
animal.

determination. If the owner of the animal contests the determination, he or she

own determination as to viciousness. Said hearing shall be conducted within

or against the owner of the animal regardless of the fact that said owner fails
to appear at said hearing.
   (F)   The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive
upon all parties thereto. A finding that the animal is not vicious does not
preclude the animal control board from making a later determination that the
animal is vicious based upon subsequent actions of the animal.
   (G)   In the event the animal control officer or a law enforcement officer
has probable cause to believe that an animal is vicious and may pose a threat

8-4-5-3: LOCAL LIMITS:
The City shall from time to time establish quantitative or other limitations
where necessary to protect against pass through and interference and to provide
for protection of the POTW, worker safety, public health, or environment. No
user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following
pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
   (A)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation and
operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths (3/4)
horsepower or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the City;
   (B)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes or
concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not;
   (C)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the City for such materials;
   (D)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the City as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage,
to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies of
jurisdiction of such discharge to the receiving waters;
   (E)   Materials which exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert
suspended solids, such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries
and lime residues or of dissolved solids, such as but not limited to sodium
chloride and sodium sulfate. (Ord. 356, 2-6-2017)
8-4-6: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
   (A)   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time
limitations specified by the EPA, the State, or the Public Works
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City
for review and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an acceptable discharge to the City under the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Public Works Superintendent may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Public Works Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand,
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Public Works
Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the user at its expense. The introduction of chemical,
bacterial, enzyme, or any other additive into an interceptor, directly or
indirectly, that causes interference with the normal operation of the unit or
causes pass through of prohibited substances is prohibited. Interceptor
maintenance and cleaning records shall be maintained by the user and made
available to pretreatment inspectors for review upon request. Users with the
potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. (Ord. 356, 2-6-2017)
8-4-7: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   (A)   Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring
facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the City. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's
premises, except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, the City may concur with the facility being constructed
in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The Public
Works Superintendent, whenever applicable, may require the construction and
maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end
of a manufacturing line or a wastewater treatment system).
   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
including the sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   (C)   The Public Works Superintendent may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction
standards and specifications. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 356, 2-6-2017)
8-4-8: SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Grab Samples: Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during the 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows:
for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
POTW, as appropriate.
   (B)   Baseline Monitoring: For sampling required in support of baseline
monitoring, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the POTW may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12 (e) and (h), the POTW shall
require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (C)   Location For Taking Samples: Samples shall be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist, immediately downstream
from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a
location determined by the City.
   (D)   Sample Results: All sample results shall indicate the time, date and
place of sampling, and methods of analysis and shall certify that the
wastestream sampled is representative of normal work cycles and expected
pollutant discharges from the user.
   (E)   Pollutant Analyses: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in
40 CFR part 136. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
   (F)   Agreements To Accept Industrial Wastes: No statement contained in this
section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the City and industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to
payment therefor, by the industrial concern. (Ord. 356, 2-6-2017)
8-4-9: ENTRY POWERS:
The City shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the Public Works Superintendent ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Public Works Superintendent will be permitted
to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   (B)   The Public Works Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (C)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Public Works Superintendent and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   (D)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Superintendent access
to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 356, 2-6-
2017)
8-4-10: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in this chapter, and/or in the judgment of the City
may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, in addition to the penalty schedule outlined in title I,
chapter 3 of this Code, the City may:
   (A)   Reject the wastes;
   (B)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;

Code)
8-6-4: USE OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   (A)   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on any premises at the
point on the premises where the consumer connects to the public water supply
system or within any premises where, in the judgment of the city, the nature
and extent of the activities, or the materials stored on the premises, would
present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health and/or deleterious to the
quality of the water should a cross connection occur; even though such cross
connection does not exist at the time the backflow prevention devices shall be
installed under circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Premises having any auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of
the auxiliary supply is in compliance with state of Idaho title 1, chapter 8,
Idaho regulations for public drinking water and is acceptable to the city.
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross connections exist.
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist.
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being
established or reestablished.
      5.   Premises, on which any contaminant is handled under pressure so as
to permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters.
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard
might result.
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public
water supply. A backflow prevention device shall be installed at these
facilities unless the city and department determine that no hazard exists:
Agricultural chemical storage, formulations and distribution facilities;
Car washes;
Chemical or other industrial plants;
Food processing plants;
Hospitals;
Laboratories;
Mortuaries;
Petroleum storage facilities;
Piers and docks;
Sewage treatment plants;
Tank truck fill stations;
Other facilities specified by the director or the city.
   (B)   The type of protective device required shall depend on the degree of
hazard which exists:
      1.   In cases where testing and repair of mechanical devices is not
possible an air gap separation shall be required.
      2.   An air gap separation or reduced pressure principle prevention
device shall be required where the water system may be contaminated with sewage
or other hazardous or toxic substances which may have an effect on the health
of the consumer.
      3.   A double check valve assembly, an air gap separation, or a reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed where the
water system may be contaminated with a substance which may be aesthetically
objectionable but not hazardous to the health of the consumer.
   (C)   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be
installed at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are
not used, or at a location designated by the city. The device shall be located
so as to be readily accessible for maintenance and testing, and furthermore,
where not part of the device will be submerged.
   (D)   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be
installed under the supervision of, and with the approval of, the water and
sewer superintendent or his designee.
   (E)   Any protective device required by this chapter shall be a model

backflow prevention program. Inspections, tests and maintenance of backflow
prevention devices shall be at the customer's expense. Whenever the devices are
found to be defective, they shall be repaired or replaced at the customer's
expense. Inspections, tests, repairs and records thereof shall be accomplished
under the city's supervision.
   (G)   Failure of a customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance,
testing or inspection of backflow prevention devices required by this chapter
and section 1-8306 of the Idaho regulations for public drinking water, shall be
grounds for the termination of water services to the premises, or, in the
alternative, the installation of an air gap separation or other device at the
customer's expense. (1960 Code)
8-6-5: CROSS CONNECTION INSPECTION:
   (A)   No water shall be delivered to any new facility cited in subsection
8-6-4(A) of this chapter within areas served by city water until the same shall

act to the extent of sixty percent (60%) of its reproduction value as
determined by the City Council at the time of the damage shall not be restored

VARIANCE
SECTION:
11-17-1: General
11-17-2: Application And Standards
11-17-3: Supplementary Conditions And Safeguards
11-17-4: Public Hearing
11-17-5: Action By The Planning And Zoning Commission
11-17-1: GENERAL:
The Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming
use of neighboring lands, structures or building in the same zone and not
permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or buildings in other zones
shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be
granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict
application of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary
hardship. A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege, but
may be granted to an applicant only upon showing of undue hardship. (Ord. 253,
7-26-1999)
11-17-2: APPLICATION AND STANDARDS:
   (A)   A variance from the terms of this title shall not be granted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission unless and until a written application for a
variance is submitted to the Administrator and the Planning and Zoning
Commission, which application contains the following information:
      1.   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s).
      2.   Legal description of property.
      3.   Description of nature of variance requested.
      4.   Names and addresses of property owners within three hundred feet
(300') beyond the external boundaries of the land being considered. (Ord. 253,
7-26-1999)
      5.   A filing fee as set by resolution of the City Council shall
accompany the application. (Ord. 375, 6-18-2018)
      6.   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the zone.
         (b)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same zone under the terms of this title.
         (c)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
         (d)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same zone. A variance attaches to the realty and
is transferable with the title to the property.
   (B)   A variance shall not be granted unless the Planning and Zoning
Commission makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented to it which support conclusions that the above mentioned
standards and conditions have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 253, 7-26-1999)
11-17-3: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the Planning and Zoning Commission grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this title in the
zone involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms
of this title in said zone. In granting any variance, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards and, when made a
part of the terms under which the variance is granted, any deviation shall be
deemed a violation of this Title. (Ord. 253, 7-26-1999)
11-17-4: PUBLIC HEARING:
Upon receipt of the application for a variance, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall hold a public hearing, publish notice in a newspaper of
general circulation within the County, or the official City newspaper, and give
written notice to all parties as required in Section
11-15-6 of this Title. (Ord. 253, 7-26-1999)
11-17-5: ACTION BY THE PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION:
   (A)   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing or at the next
regular meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission, whichever occurs last,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall either approve, conditionally approve
or disapprove the request for a variance.
   (B)   Upon granting or denying an application, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall specify:
      1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application.
      2.   The reasons for approval or denial.
      3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
   (C)   Within thirty (30) days after a decision has been rendered, the
Administrator shall provide the applicant with written notice of the action on
the request.
   (D)   The applicant or any affected person who appeared in person or in
writing before the Planning and Zoning Commission may appeal the decision of
the Commission to the City Council, in accordance with Chapter 18 of this
Title. (Ord. 253, 7-26-1999)

The purpose of this Chapter is to standardize the appeal procedure for any
party from any adverse ruling of either the City Council, Commission or
Administrator. All time limits set out herein shall be deemed controlling
unless a specific time limit is set out in another section. Any party aggrieved
by the final action of the Administrator, Commission or City Council, may
appeal in accordance with the appellant's procedures herein set forth. Time
limits shall be deemed jurisdictional. (Ord., 5-7-1984)
11-18-2: APPEALS FROM DECISIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR:

decision of the Administrator. Such appeal must be filed in writing with the
Administrator or the Commission within fifteen (15) days after the decision is
rendered.

set out reasons why the appealing party is aggrieved and shall state why the
appellant believes the Administrator committed error.
   (C)   The Commission may hear the appeal either by receiving and reviewing
the record accumulated by the Administrator or by holding a hearing. Should the
Commission choose to schedule a hearing, such a hearing shall be held at the
first regular Commission meeting which falls after the filing of the notice of
appeal, provided that at least five (5) days have elapsed between notice of
filing and meeting. If the regular meeting is less than five (5) days after
filing, said hearing may be scheduled at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
Should the Commission choose to decide an appeal strictly on the record
presented by the Administrator, the Commission may do so at any time, but no
later than the first regular meeting which occurs fifteen (15) days after the
filing of the notice of appeal.
   (D)   Within sixty (60) days after the hearing or record review, the
Commission shall render a decision together with a summary of findings, setting
forth reasons why a particular decision was made.
   (E)   Should the Commission fail to take action within the allotted time,
the appeal shall be deemed denied and the aggrieved party may pursue further
appeal.

but must be written and conform to the requirements of Section
11-18-2(B).
   (B)   The City Council may hear the appeal as set out in Section
11-18-2(C), and may do so at any regularly or specially scheduled meeting. Such
meeting must be held within thirty (30) days of the filing of the notice of
appeal.
   (C)   Should the City Council schedule a hearing de novo, it shall give the
appellant at least three (3) days' written or oral notice. An appearance at any
hearing automatically waives notice requirements unless the appellant can
demonstrate some prejudice resulting from insufficient notice.
   (D)   Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time at the request of
either party for good cause shown. A subsequent meeting where a final decision
is rendered must be held within sixty (60) days of the adjourned meeting,
unless agreed otherwise by the parties.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by any action of the City Council may appeal to
the District Court for administrative relief. No court action shall be taken
until all administrative remedies are exhausted.
   (F)   Should the City Council fail to act within the time limits set out
herein, the appeal shall be deemed automatically denied and the appellant free
to pursue his remedies in court.
11-18-4: GENERAL:
   (A)   Any party may be represented at any stage by counsel.
   (B)   The City Council or Commission shall act by a simple majority of a
quorum.
   (C)   Any appeal stays all work or all proceedings in furtherance of the
action unless the Administrator certifies to the Commission after the notice of
appeal is filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the application, a
stay would, in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. (Ord., 5-

11-22-11: Public Hearings
11-22-12: Enforcement Of Development Agreements
11-22-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of a development agreement is to provide a vehicle for development
or uses in areas where, in the opinion of the Council, the use of a development
agreement will assure compliance with the required rezone findings and
conclusions. Development agreements can be used when a determination is made
that a proposed rezone by itself is not sufficient to ensure compliance and the
use of a development agreement would allow a development to proceed under
stricter regulations than those imposed generally in the proposed zoning
district. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as relieving the property
which is subject to development agreement restrictions from further compliance
with all other permit and code requirements applicable because of the zoning
designation of the property. Restrictions imposed upon property as a result of
a development agreement are in addition to all other zoning ordinance
requirements. (Ord. 235, 3-3-1997)
11-22-2: TIME OF FILING:
Simultaneously with or after an application for rezone has been received by the
Administrator, a request to enter into a development agreement for an affected
parcel may be submitted by the rezone applicant. In the absence of a request by
a rezone applicant, a development agreement may be required by the Council at
the Council's rezone hearing, or may be required by Council upon recommendation
from the Commission following the Commission's rezone hearing. (Ord. 235, 3-3-
1997)
11-22-3: RECOMMENDATION BY COMMISSION:
In the event of a recommendation by the Commission that a development agreement
should be entered into, the rezone shall be forwarded to the City Council with
a recommendation that the requested rezone be denied or that it be remanded to
the Commission, with the Council requiring an application for a development
agreement to be submitted by the applicant. If, however, the applicant agrees
to submit an application for a development agreement prior to the conclusion of
the Commission's rezone hearing, then the Commission shall defer its
recommendation to the City Council on the rezone application until a public
hearing is held on the development agreement application. After the public
hearing on the development agreement application is held, the Commission shall
forward its recommendation on both the rezone and development agreement
requests to the City Council. (Ord. 235, 3-3-1997)
11-22-4: DETERMINATION OF NEED:
In the event no development agreement has been submitted to the Council at the
time of its rezone hearing, in the event a determination is made by the Council
that a development agreement should be entered into, the Council shall remand
the matter back to the Commission, with the Council requiring an application
for a development agreement to be submitted by the applicant. The Council
shall, upon remand direct the Commission on the specific issues to be addressed
by the development agreement. The Commission shall then proceed as specified in
this Chapter. (Ord. 235, 3-3-1997)
11-22-5: COMMISSION CONSIDERATION:
In the event a developer submits an application for a development agreement in
accordance with Section
11-22-2 or
11-22-3 of this Chapter, the developer's application for a development
agreement shall be taken to the Commission at the time of the scheduled rezone
hearing. The Commission shall, following consideration of the rezone and
development agreement applications, forward its recommendation to the City
Council regarding each of the applicant's requests. (Ord. 235, 3-3-1997)
11-22-6: TIME LIMITS STAYED:
In the event a request for a development agreement is filed pursuant to section
11-22-2 or
11-22-3 of this chapter, all time limits required by this Code may be stayed
upon affirmative vote of the Council or commission. (Ord. 235, 3-3-1997)
11-22-7: FORM OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT APPLICATION:
All applications for development agreements shall be in a form as required by
the City Clerk or the Zoning Administrator. No application shall be accepted by
the Clerk which does not include the following:
   (A)   An affidavit or a sworn statement by the owner of the property
agreeing that the use of the property shall be subject to the uses set out in

including the time period with which the development or use must commence and
the time period within which the development and the terms of the agreement are
to be completed.
   (E)   A statement that failure to comply with all commitments in the
approved development agreement shall be deemed a consent to rezone the property
to the pre-existing zone, or in the case of an initial zone at annexation, a
zone deemed appropriate by the Council.
   (F)   If the development agreement is being requested by the rezone
applicant, as opposed to having been required by Council, a statement must be

1997)
   (G)   A fee as set by resolution of the City Council shall accompany the
application to defray the costs of the notice and publication requirements of
the public hearings. (Ord. 375, 6-18-2018)
11-22-8: PHASING PLAN AND PROPOSED PHASING SCHEDULE:
   (A)   Process: Upon receipt of an application for development agreement, the
City Clerk or the Zoning Administrator shall work with the applicant to prepare
a development agreement. The development agreement shall include the
requirements as set out in subsection
11-22-7(C) of this chapter and any other information which, in the discretion
of the City Clerk or the Zoning Administrator, would address the concerns for
the development. Such concerns addressed may include, but shall not be limited
to, density, bulk, site design, mitigation of impacts on the surrounding
neighborhood, appearance, provision of utilities or public facilities and
restrictions on use. The draft of the development agreement shall be reviewed
by the City Attorney and City Engineer as to form prior to being sent to the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (B)   Approval Of A Development Agreement:
      1.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on
the draft development agreement and the rezone request, and make recommendation
to the Council. The Commission may recommend approval or denial and may
recommend the addition of conditions, terms, duties or obligations to the
development agreement.
      2.   The Council shall hold a public hearing on the draft agreement and
the rezone request, and shall review the recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The Council may approve, deny, or may add conditions, terms,
duties or obligations to the development agreement. Approval or denial of
development agreements shall be at the sole discretion of the Council.
      3.   Upon approval of a development agreement or any modification
submitted by the Council or the applicant, said approval shall be recorded at
the expense of the applicant and prior to the rezone approval. Proof of
recording must be submitted by the applicant prior to the passage of the rezone
ordinance by the City Council. The development agreement, or any modification
thereto, and all conditions, terms, duties or obligations included therein,
shall run with the land and shall be considered continuing obligations of the

where a showing is made that unusual topography or other conditions make it
impossible to meet this requirement an exception may be approved by the
Council.
