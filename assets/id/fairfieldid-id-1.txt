or connection until the inspection is made and the work approved.
Notwithstanding the provision in this subsection for inspections, any
applicant, or his successor, who installs any pipeline or connection in a
manner violative of the codes and standards specified herein shall cause
corrections to be made at his own expense promptly following demand by the
city.

resulting from such interruption or termination.
   C.   Access To Premises: Employees of the city and persons under contract
with the city, properly identified, shall have free access at reasonable hours

system and sewage disposal facilities of the city, and by the water system of
the city. All owners who receive or have the right to receive the benefit of
the municipal sewer and water systems shall, in return for said benefit, pay
monthly user fees as established by resolution of the city council. All
"improved property" in the city, defined as any lot with a structure of not
more than three hundred (300) square feet and/or used as a dwelling, whether
vacant or not, to which the municipal sewer system and municipal water system
is available, but is not used by the owner or occupier of said parcel of land,
is still subject to monthly minimum user charges to cover the costs of
providing and maintaining the system. The base fee shall be established by
resolution of the city council and shall be based on the costs and expenses of
operation, maintenance and repair of the municipal water system and municipal
sewer system.
      2.   No owner shall have water delivered or turned on, or be connected to
the city sewer disposal facilities until he has deposited with the city
treasurer a sum established by the city council through resolution for each
single-family dwelling, mobile home, water and sewer user and for each unit of
a multiple- family dwelling or apartment. This deposit shall be refunded, or
applied to any outstanding charges for the owner's use of water or sewer, at
the time he orders the water or sewer turned off.
      3.   If the owner has made prompt payments for a period of two (2) years,
meaning that the owner has not been placed on the city's shutoff list, the
owner may make a written request for a refund of his or her water deposit,
provided said remaining deposit is in a nondeminimus amount of five dollars
($5.00) or more. Any refund of the water and sewer deposit will be attributed
to the balance due and owing on the owner's account.
      4.   All contracts heretofore entered into between the city and
nonresident users or potential users are hereby ratified and confirmed.
   B.   General Duties Of City Clerk: The city clerk shall collect and receive
all connection fees, water service charges, sewer service charges and other
funds payable by law to the city with respect to the municipal water system or
sewer system. The city clerk shall keep accurate and complete records of all
funds received, dates and amounts received, names of payors and accounts
credited, together with accurate and complete accounts of all disbursements,
showing the dates and amounts thereof, payees, and accounts debited. All funds
received or held shall be deposited by the city clerk in a bank duly authorized
to accept such deposits, pursuant to the Idaho Code.
   C.   Billings: With the approval of the city council, the city clerk shall
establish a date or series of dates on which water service and sewer service
charge bills are sent to owners of property or premises using or consuming
water from the municipal water system or using the municipal sewer system.
Billings shall be rendered according to this schedule, and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from date of billing. If the owner does not pay the amount
owed within thirty (30) days after the billing is rendered, the city clerk
shall cause a notice to be issued to such owner, stating that the account is
delinquent, and that, if the amount of the delinquency is not paid within
twenty (20) further days, water service will be discontinued and water service
will not be reinstated except upon payment of the delinquent amount, plus a
twenty dollar ($20.00) resumption of service fee. The notice shall also advise
the owner that, if he contests the amount of the delinquency or seeks relief
from shutting off water service, he must apply in writing at the city clerk's
office for a hearing before the city council, prior to expiration of the twenty
(20) day period. If such written application is received, water service will
not be shut off until the city council has conducted a hearing and has made its
determination of the case.
   D.   Lien And Collection Of Delinquencies: Any delinquency in payment of
water or sewer fees shall become a lien against the real property to which
water and sewer services were furnished, upon recording, at the office of the
Camas County recorder, of the city clerk's sworn certification of the
delinquency. Provided, however, the city shall not initially deny or
discontinue water or sewer service to any water consumer or sewer user because
of any delinquent bill on that premises that is attributable to the prior water
or sewer user of another water consumer or sewer user. The city may collect
such delinquency by commencement of a civil action, and, if such action
prevails, the city shall be entitled to award of its costs and reasonable
attorney fees. When a delinquency has been recovered following recording of a
lien, satisfaction of the lien shall be recorded. In the alternative to
collecting by commencement of a civil action, the city may certify under oath
the amount of the delinquency to the treasurer of Camas County who shall, upon
receiving such certification, include the amount of the delinquency in the next
assessment of real property taxes against the premises in question, to the
extent that such action is authorized by applicable provisions of the Idaho
Code.
   E.   Adjustment To Water Billings: In cases where adjustments are required,
upon written application by the owner, the city council may make adjustments to
unfair or inequitable water billings, including, without limitation,
adjustments to compensate for leaking pipes or fixtures for which the city is
responsible. The power of adjustment shall not be used by the city council to
confer a discriminatory benefit, or to impose a discriminatory burden upon any
owner of a property or premises using or consuming water from the municipal
water system.

from time to time set the rate to charge for connection to the sewage system
and a rate for the users of the city sewage system. For new construction, the
sewer user charge is to begin when the service connection has been inspected
and approved or when the building being served is substantially completed,
whichever is the latest date. The monthly sewage user charge is established to
cover operation and maintenance costs of the treatment system, and to provide a
fund to pay replacement costs. All charges for connections and for sewerage
service provided for in this section shall be a lien upon the property with

This chapter shall officially be known and cited as the CROSS-CONNECTION
CONTROL ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FAIRFIELD. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-2: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to:
      1.   Protect the public water supply of the City by isolating the
customer's water service from the City water system, thus preventing
contamination or pollution, which could backflow from the customer's premises
to the City water system;
      2.   Eliminate both potential and existing cross-connections between the
potable water system and non-potable water systems within the customer's
premises; and
      3.   Maintain the Backflow Prevention Program by administering an
Inspection and Testing Program of the customer premises and backflow prevention
assemblies installed at the location specified by the City Water Department.
(Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-3: DEFINITIONS:
APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE OR ASSEMBLY: A device or assembly that has
been designed specifically for preventing the backflow of water or liquid from
entering the system and the device that has passed laboratory and field
evaluation tests performed by a recognized testing organization which has
demonstrated competency to perform such tests to the Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality.
BACK PRESSURE: A pressure, higher than the supply pressure caused by a pump,
elevated tank, boiler, or any other means that may cause backflow.
BACK SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into
the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other
than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable
water supply system.
BACKFLOW: The reversal of the normal flow of water in a potable water
distribution system as a result of cross-connection.
CITY WATER SYSTEM: The City of Fairfield's water source facilities, water
storage facilities and distribution system under the control of the City Water
Department up to and including the meter.
CROSS-CONNECTION: Any actual or potential connection or piping arrangement
between a potable water system and any other source or system through which it
is possible to introduce into the potable water system any used water, water
from any source other than an approved public water system, industrial fluid,
gas or substance other than the intended potable water with which the system is
supplied. Cross- connections include bypass arrangements, jumper connections,
removable sections, swivel or change-over devices and other temporary or
permanent devices which, or because of which "backflow" can or may occur. (Ord.
271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-4: WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION; CROSS-CONNECTION PROHIBITED:
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by
the City or any other water utility, unless the water supplying the premises is
protected as required by State and City laws and regulations. It is unlawful
for the owner or occupant of any premises using water supplied by the City
water system or other water utility to cross-connect such water supply to a
foreign or non-approved source of water that does not meet the standards of the
City of Fairfield and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. It shall
be the responsibility of the owner of occupiable premises to effect
installation and inspections as required herein, and to give notice to the
supplier water utility of any deficiencies of his/her water system in that
regard. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-5: DUTY TO INSTALL AND INSPECT ANNUALLY:
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of property where water is
consumed, to purchase, install, test and maintain approved backflow prevention
devices or assemblies wherever it will be possible for used, unclean, polluted
or contaminated water, mixtures, or substances to enter any portion of his/her
potable water system, and to otherwise control cross-connections. Such owner
shall have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once a
year at the owner's expense. Where the City deems the hazard to be great, or
where an assembly has a history of failing tests, the City may require the
owner to have such inspections and tests at a more frequent interval as
prescribed by the City. All such tests shall be made according to the standards
set forth by the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality by testers licensed
by the Idaho Bureau of Occupational Licenses. Test reports will be made in
triplicate, with copies going to the owner, the City Water Department and one
retained by the inspector for his/her records. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-6: NEW CONSTRUCTION:
The building official of the City and the State plumbing inspector will review
all plans for new construction to ensure that unprotected cross-connections are
not an integral part of the owner's water system. If a cross-connection cannot
be eliminated, protection will be required by installation of an air gap or
other approved backflow prevention device or assembly, in accordance with the
Uniform Plumbing Code, Idaho Code section 37-2102, IDAPA 58.01.08, table
900.02, and the current edition of the Accepted Procedures and Practice in
Cross Connection Control Manual Pacific Northwest Section of American Water
Works Association (AWWA), as adopted. Water vacating the drinking water supply
must do so by means of an approved air gap or mechanical backflow prevention
device or assembly as required by said Code. The owner shall provide the
building official with verification of a certified test of assembly before a
certificate of occupancy is issued. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-7: INSTALLATION REQUIRED:
Whenever the City deems that a service water usage contributes a sufficient
hazard to the water supply and a property owner has not made appropriate
installation, the installation of an approved backflow prevention device or
assembly shall be required on the lateral service line of the owner's water
system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside the building being
served, but before the first branch line leading off the lateral service line
in any event. The type of protective device or assembly shall comply with local
and State requirements. Backflow assemblies must be on the List of Approved
Assemblies published by the University of Southern California Foundation for
Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research. The owner shall provide the
City Water Department with a certified test of such backflow prevention devices
or assemblies within ten (10) working days after their initial installation in
order to determine proper function. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-8: EXISTING EQUIPMENT:
All existing backflow prevention assemblies, which do not meet the requirements
hereof, shall nonetheless be required to comply with the requirements of this
chapter. Backflow prevention assemblies that are deemed by the building
official or the City Water Department to be adequate for the purposes intended
may receive a waiver of compliance with any particular provision hereof in
writing by the City. Such previously existing assemblies shall be subject in
any event to the annual testing requirements of this chapter. Whenever an
existing assembly is moved to another location, or requires more than minimum
maintenance, or where it is determined to constitute a hazard to health, the
unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention device or assembly
meeting the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-9: REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT:
The maintenance, including necessary repairs, of all backflow prevention
devices or assemblies and cross-connection devices required by this chapter
shall be the responsibility of the owner of property where an assembly or
device is installed, and failure to adequately maintain any required equipment
shall be a violation hereof. No device or assembly shall be placed back in
service unless it is functioning as required. (Ord. 271, 8-11-2016)
6-5-10: ACCESS FOR INSPECTION:
All water systems shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times by
authorized representatives of the City Water Department in order to determine
whether cross- connections or other structural or sanitary hazards including
violations of this chapter exist. In order to make such determination, the
inspection shall include access to above-ceiling areas, pits, paneled interior
areas, or their locations where cross- connections might exist. The owner and
any occupant shall be responsible to provide a route of access across the
property for inspection purposes that is free from litter, overgrowth, the
threat of a vicious animal, or other hindrance that may be detrimental to the
safety of the inspector or obstructive to his/her ease of access. (Ord. 271, 8-
11-2016)
6-5-11: CERTIFIED BACKFLOW TECHNICIAN:
All tests of backflow prevention devices or assemblies shall be conducted by a
certified backflow technician who will be responsible for the competence and
accuracy of all tests and reports. Such technician shall be responsible for the
following:
   A.   Assure that acceptable testing equipment and procedures are used for
the testing, repairing or overhauling of backflow prevention devices or
assemblies.
   B.   Make report of such testing and/or repair within required times to the
owner and the City Water Department on a form approved for such use by the City
Water Department.
   C.   Include in all reports a list of any materials or replacement parts

number.
   I.   Agreement For Reduction In Requirement: Where there is an adequate
public transit system, or where, for any other reason, parking demand is
unusually low, such as where uses with differing operating hours or needs share
parking under a formal, written agreement to which the city is a party, then
the parking space provisions cited herein may be reduced proportionately by the
planning and zoning commission. If the owner whose parking facility is under
such an agreement which requires the facility to be available to the patrons of
the other use(s), fails or refuses to make such parking available in accordance
with the agreement, such failure or refusal is a violation of this title.
   J.   Special Conditions: Where special conditions exist which make
compliance with these standards impractical, the planning and zoning commission
will consider alternative proposals presented according to the procedures and
standards for a variance.
   K.   Loading Spaces: Required off street loading space is not to be included
as off street parking space in computation of required off street parking
spaces. All off street loading spaces shall be located outside of any right of
way or a street or alley.

winter business, the developer or owner of the property shall designate a snow
storage area and remove snow as necessary to maintain minimum traffic
circulation and parking.
   M.   Adjustments: Adjustments to required parking may be authorized by the
planning and zoning commission based upon evidence of actual parking demand for
the proposed use.
   N.   Multiple Uses; Shared Parking: Required parking facilities for two (2)
or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may be satisfied by the same
parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that the owners or operators
show that the need for parking facilities does not materially overlap (e.g.,
uses primarily of a daytime versus nighttime nature; weekday uses versus
weekend uses); and provided, that the right of joint use is evidenced by a
recorded deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument establishing the
joint use. The city may review and approve owner requests for shared parking.
   O.   Authority To Reduce Required Parking: If more than one type of land use
occupies a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirements for off
street automobile parking shall be the sum of the requirements for all uses,
unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are actually less (i.e.,
the uses operate on different days or at different times of the day). The city
may reduce the total parking required accordingly. (Ord. 223, 7-13-2006; amd.
Ord. 254, 1-15-2015)

be designed in such a manner that any vehicle leaving or entering the parking
area from or onto a public or private street shall be traveling in a forward
motion. Access driveways for parking areas or loading spaces shall be located
in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such area shall be clearly
visible by a pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or driveway from a
public or private street.
   E.   Screening And/Or Landscaping:
      1.   Parking areas shall be effectively screened on all sides which
adjoin or face any property used for residential purposes by an acceptably
designed wall, fence or planting screen. Use of chainlink fencing in or
adjacent to residential areas is discouraged; if proposed, approval by the
administrator is required.
      2.   Such fence or wall shall be not less than four feet (4') nor more

GLARE: Stray, unshielded light striking the eye that may result in: a) nuisance
or annoyance glare such as light shining into a window; b) discomfort glare
such as bright light causing a squinting of the eyes; c) disabling glare such
as bright light reducing the ability of the eyes to see into shadows; or d)
reduction of visual performance.
LAMP: The generic term for an artificial light source, to be distinguished from
the whole assembly (see definition of Luminaire). Commonly referred to as
"bulb".
LIGHT POLLUTION: Any adverse effect of manmade light including, but not limited
to, discomfort to the eye or diminished vision due to glare, light trespass,
uplighting, the uncomfortable distraction of the eye, or any manmade light that
diminishes the ability to view the night sky.

at the luminaire. Lumen output of most lamps is listed on the packaging. For
example, a sixty (60) watt incandescent lamp, six (6) to eight (8) watt LED,
and a fluorescent thirteen (13) watt lamp produce approximately nine hundred
(900) lumens while a fifty five (55) watt low pressure sodium lamp produces
eight thousand (8,000) lumens.

used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outdoors. Luminaires that
are indoors that are intended to light something outside are considered outdoor
lighting for the purpose of this chapter.
PARTIALLY SHIELDED: A type of luminaire that incorporates a translucent
barrier, the "partial shield" around the lamp that allows some light to pass
through the barrier while concealing the lamp from the viewer.
SKYGLOW: The overhead glow from light emitted sideways and upwards caused by
the reflection and scattering of light by dust, water vapor and other particles
suspended in the atmosphere, and which reduces one's ability to view the night
sky.
UNSHIELDED: A type of luminaire that only incorporates clear glass, which
permits all light to escape.

result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of
this title would result in unnecessary hardship or the loss of a building or
site that is on a national, state, or local register of historic places or
sites. (Ord. 223, 7-13-2006)

peculiar to the land, structures or buildings in the same district.
         b.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this title.
         c.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
   B.   Findings Of Fact: A variance shall not be granted unless the commission
makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence
presented to it which support conclusions that the above mentioned standards
and conditions have been met by the applicant. (Ord. 223, 7-13-2006)
8-12-2-4: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
Under no circumstances shall the commission grant an appeal or variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this title in the district
involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this
title in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this title. (Ord. 223, 7-13-2006)

public hearing:
      1.   There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property that the strict application of the provisions of this title would
clearly be impracticable, or unreasonable; in such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his reasons in writing to the specific provisions or requirements
involved;
      2.   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated;
      3.   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code; and
      4.   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the interest
and purpose of this title and the comprehensive development plan. (Ord. 165, 7-
30-1992)
9-8-2: TOPOGRAPHICAL VARIANCE LIMITATION:
Where, in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this title would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, other
physical conditions, or other such conditions which are not self-inflicted, or
that these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the
objectives of this title, the planning and zoning commission may recommend to
the city council that variance modifications or a waiver of these requirements
be granted. (Ord. 165, 7-30-1992)

protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-4: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.

parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
ADDITION (To An Existing Building): An extension or increase in the floor area
or height of a building or structure.
APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation
of provisions of this chapter or request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA- approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of structure.
CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum
currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for measuring heights is
the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.

community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The Elevation Certificate is an important administrative
tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; it is used to document elevation information necessary to ensure
compliance with community floodplain management regulations; and it may be used
to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map
Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community, March 18, 1985.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on

utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
FLOOD FRINGE: Shall have the meaning set forth in Idaho Code section 46-1021,
as may be amended: "Flood fringe" is that portion of the floodplain outside of
the floodway covered by floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the
Federal Insurance Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been
designated as Zones A, M, and/or E.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).

flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations; or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or
flood- related erosion hazards.
FLOOD OR FLOODING:
   A.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
as defined in subsection A2 of this definition and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when
earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   B.   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection A1 of this definition.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
   A.   In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations (BFEs) have
been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus one foot (1') of
freeboard; and
   B.   In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established, this
elevation shall be at least one foot (1') above the highest adjacent grade.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of flooding
in the area.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation
(BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE).
Freeboard shall be one foot (1').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1.   By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      2.   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F):
   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as
to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with
the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of
special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and
approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building permits and/or
flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR
does not change the NFIP map.
   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's location in relation to the special flood hazard area (SFHA). LOMAs
are usually issued because a property has been inadvertently mapped as being in
the floodplain but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood
elevation.
   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) or both.
LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the
modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the
affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
   Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The
LOMR-F does not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Shall have the meaning set forth in Idaho Code section 46-
1021, as may be amended: "Local government", in the context of this chapter,
means any county or city having planning and zoning authority to regulate land
use within its jurisdiction.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this
chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations
(BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
MITIGATION: Shall have the meaning set forth in Idaho Code section 46-1021, as
may be amended: "Mitigation" means any action taken which will reduce the
impact, damage, or cost of the next flood that occurs.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program
of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide
control works, and floodplain management regulations.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program created
by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. Any construction started after March 18, 1985
and before the effective start date of this chapter is subject to the ordinance
in effect at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of construction
was within one hundred eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by the City of Fairfield, which date is March 18, 1985.
PERSON: Shall have the meaning set forth in Idaho Code section 46-1021, as may
be amended: "Person" means any individual, group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, political subdivision, public or private agency, or
entity.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before March 18, 1985, the effective date of the initial
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis, and
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: Shall have the meaning set forth in Idaho Code section 46-
1021, as may be amended: "Regulatory flood" is a flood determined to be
representative of large floods known to have occurred in Idaho and which may be
expected to occur on a particular stream because of like physical
characteristics. The regulatory flood is based upon a statistical analysis of
stream flow records available for the watershed or an analysis of rainfall and
runoff characteristics in the watershed. In inland areas, the flood frequency
of the regulatory flood is once in every one hundred (100) years. This means
that in any given year there is a one percent (1%) chance that a regulatory
flood may occur or be exceeded.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
10-year period since 1978.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See
definition of "substantial improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-
related damage sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
chapter.
TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS: FEMA publications that provide
guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are
contained in title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations section 60.3. The
bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and local
officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by
members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
   It should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets
provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the State or local Building Code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-5: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:

required by section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments
of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
   C.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water Resources
State Coordinator for the NFIP prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
   D.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained.
   E.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the
reference level (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new and
substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 10-1-15C of this chapter.
   F.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which all
new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been floodproofed,
in accordance with the provisions of subsection
10-1-15C of this chapter.
   G.   Obtain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of all public
utilities in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10-1-15C of this

the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean sea level. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
         b.   An Elevation Certificate (FEMA Form 86-0-33) is required after
the reference level is established. Within seven (7) calendar days of
establishment of the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done
within the seven (7) day calendar period and prior to submission of the
certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and
prior to further work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project.
         c.   A final as-built Finished Construction Elevation Certificate
(FEMA Form 86-0-33) is required after construction is completed and prior to
Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of
final as-built construction of the elevation of the reference level and all
attendant utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy.
      2.   Floodproofing Certificate: If non-residential floodproofing is used
to meet the flood protection elevation requirements, a Floodproofing
Certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan,
and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start
of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design
elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to
mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the
operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit
approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required
corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to
construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold
the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy.
      3.   Manufactured Home: If a manufactured home is placed within Zone A
and the elevation of the chassis is more than thirty six inches (36") in height
above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance
with the provisions of subsection
10-1-19C of this chapter.
      4.   Altering Or Relocating Watercourse: If a watercourse is to be
altered or relocated, the following shall all be submitted by the permit
applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit:
         a.   A description of the extent of watercourse alteration or
relocation; and
         b.   A professional engineer's certified report on the effects of the
proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the
effects to properties located both upstream and downstream; and
         c.   A map showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration
or relocation; and
         d.   An Idaho stream channel alteration permit approval shall be
provided by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.
      5.   Certification Exemptions: The following structures, if located
within Zone A, are exempt from the elevation/floodproofing certification
requirements specified in subsections C5a and C5b of this section:
         a.   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of subsection
10-1-19E of this chapter;
         b.   Temporary structures meeting requirements of subsection
10-1-19F of this chapter; and
         c.   Accessory structures less than two hundred (200) square feet
meeting requirements of subsection
10-1-19G of this chapter.
   D.   Determinations For Existing Buildings And Structures: For applications
for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including
alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy,
additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of
substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and
structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the building
official, shall:
      1.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
      3.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
      4.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of the adopted Idaho
Building Code and this chapter is required. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-16: CORRECTIVE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the Floodplain Administrator finds
violations of applicable State and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited in such
notification.
   B.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating that:
      1.   The building or property is in violation of the floodplain
management regulations;
      2.   A hearing will be held before the Floodplain Administrator at a
designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      3.   Following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may issue an
order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
   C.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor
more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. Where the Floodplain
Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he
or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may
be feasible.
   D.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the local elected Governing Body by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk within ten (10)
days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the
order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local Governing Body
shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and
affirm, or revoke the order.
   E.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the Governing Body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-17: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   Appeal Board: The City Council, hereinafter referred to as the "Appeal
Board", shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
   B.   Issuance: Variances may be issued for:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
      2.   Functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the
definition as stated in section
10-1-4 of this chapter, provided provisions of subsection I of this section,
have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public
safety; or
      3.   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements of
this section.
   C.   Considerations: In passing upon variances, the Appeal Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined
under section
10-1-4 of this chapter as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
Floodplain Management Program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

each of the above factors in subsection C of this section with their
application for a variance.
   E.   Purpose Of Board: Upon consideration of the factors listed above and
the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives of this chapter.
   F.   Written Notice: Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the BFE and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
   G.   Maintenance Of Records: The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the
records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State of Idaho upon request.
   H.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or
flood fringe area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   I.   Issuance Of Variance: A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal

appeal such decision to the court, as provided in Idaho Code section 67-6535.
(Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-18: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all SFHAs the following provisions are required:
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement of the structure.
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance
with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements,
and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

FPE; and
      2.   Include, in Zone A, flood openings to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by
a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
design criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         c.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area
must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;
         d.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than
one foot (1') above the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
         e.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         f.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
   I.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure,
which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the
requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
   J.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, flood fringe
area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the
FPE in the floodway, flood fringe area, or stream setback, and provided that
such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements
of this chapter.
   K.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in section
10-1-17 of this chapter. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage
incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or
wastewater treatment facility may be located in an SFHA only if the structure
or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the FPE and certified in

   L.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and determined to be
reasonably safe from flooding.
   M.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   N.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   O.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
   P.   When a structure is partially located in an SFHA, the entire structure
shall meet the requirements for new construction and substantial improvements.
   Q.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest BFE shall apply.
   R.   Fill is prohibited in the SFHA, including construction of buildings on
fill. This includes not approving Conditional Letters or Letters of Map
Revision (CLOMR-F or LOMR-F). (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-19: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all SFHAs where BFE data has been provided, as set forth in section
10-1-6 of this chapter, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions
of section
10-1-18 of this chapter, are required:
   A.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the FPE, as defined
in section
10-1-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Non-Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the
FPE, as defined in section
10-1-4 of this chapter. Structures located in Zone A, may be floodproofed to
the flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of
the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below
the FPE are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water, using structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in subsection
10-1-15C of this chapter, along with the operational plan and the inspection
and maintenance plan.
   C.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the
reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the FPE, as defined
in section
10-1-4 of this chapter.
      2.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the Idaho Division of Building Safety's "Idaho Manufactured
Home Installation Standard" in accordance with Idaho Code section 44-2201(2).
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty six inches (36") or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty six inches (36") in height, an engineering
certification is required.
      3.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of subsection D of this section.
      4.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This plan shall be
filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the local Emergency
Management Coordinator.
   D.   Additions/Improvements:
      1.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-
conforming than the existing structure; or
         b.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      2.   Additions to post-FIRM structures that are a substantial improvement
with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in
the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards
for new construction.
      3.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
         a.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements
only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
         b.   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the
addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
      4.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one year
period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started,
must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building or
structure, the one year period begins on the date of the first improvement or
repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are
considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
         a.   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         b.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   E.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall be either:
      1.   Temporary Placement: Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and
has no permanently attached additions); or
      2.   Permanent Placement: Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new
construction, as set forth in section 10-1-18 of this chapter.
   F.   Temporary Non-Residential Structures: Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must
submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure
(s) in the event of a flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.
The following information shall be submitted in writing to the Floodplain
Administrator for review and written approval:
      1.   A specified time period for which the temporary use will be

subsection D4 of this section.
   An accessory structure with a footprint less than two hundred (200) square
feet, costs two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) or less to construct,
and satisfies the criteria outlined in this subsection is not required to meet
the elevation or floodproofing standards of subsection B of this section.
   H.   Tanks: When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within an
SFHA, the following criteria shall be met:
      1.   Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads during conditions of the base flood, including the effects of
buoyancy (assuming the tank is empty);
      2.   Elevated above-ground tanks, in flood hazard areas shall be attached
to and elevated to or above the design flood elevation on a supporting
structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement
during conditions of the base flood. Tank-supporting structures shall meet the
foundation requirements of the applicable flood hazard area;
      3.   Not elevated above-ground tanks, that do not meet the elevation
requirements of subsection B of this section shall be permitted in flood hazard
areas provided the tanks are anchored or otherwise designed and constructed to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood, including the effects
of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty and the effects of flood-borne debris.
      4.   Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and vents shall be:
         a.   At or above the FPE or fitted with covers designed to prevent the
inflow of floodwater or outflow of the contents of the tanks during conditions
of the base flood; and
         b.   Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic

the base flood.
   I.   Construction Of Below-Grade Crawlspace:
      1.   The interior grade of a crawlspace must not be below the BFE and
must not be more than two feet (2') below the exterior lowest adjacent grade
(LAG).
      2.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, must not
exceed four feet (4') at any point.
      3.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a flood event.
      4.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet
(5') per second for any crawlspace.
      5.   See Technical Bulletin 11 for further information.
   Caution: Buildings that have below-grade crawlspaces will have higher flood
insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation of the crawlspace soil at or above
the BFE. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-20: STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS:

10-1-21: EFFECT ON RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE EXISTING FLOOD DAMAGE
PREVENTION ORDINANCE:
This chapter, in part, comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions
of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted July 13, 2006, as amended, and
it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to
enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights
and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may be enforced.
The enactment of this chapter shall not affect any action, suit, or proceeding
instituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance
of City of Fairfield enacted on July 13, 2006, as amended, which are not
reenacted herein are repealed. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
10-1-22: EFFECT UPON OUTSTANDING FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction,
size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a
floodplain development permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator
or his or her authorized agents before the effective date of this chapter.
Provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding
permit within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days subsequent to the date
of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 269, 12-14-2016)
