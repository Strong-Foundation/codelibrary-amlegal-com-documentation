incurred in enforcing this chapter or for any other lawful purpose. The Council

worthy of such subsidy.
   D.   The City shall have the power to regulate the maximum rate which a
franchisee may charge subject to the provisions contained in any agreement

and except any of those producers residing in areas in which collection service
is not available for the entire area, and in such areas where no service is
rendered. The boundaries within the Municipality exempted from such charges
shall be established by the Council; provided, however, that the Council shall
have authority to grant exemptions from payment of charges, as herein provided,
to churches, nonprofit entities, fraternal organizations, and producers as
defined herein, which satisfy the Council that they do not produce or generate
solid waste. The franchisee shall not be obligated to furnish service to such
exempt business or residential units. (Ord. 265 § 6, 1987)

the public and the franchisee shall be immediately notified of all changes. The
Council may direct that the franchisee shall not collect solid waste from any
premises where said rules and regulations are not complied with, and the
failure to collect the same by such direction shall not relieve the producer of
such premises from the payment of fees or penalties as provided for herein.
(Ord. 265 § 7, 1987)

regarding the subject portion of said sidewalk shall be stayed pending such a
hearing.
   C.   Should the property owner fail to repair, restore or replace said

it cannot be removed without injury to the sidewalk, cause the snow and ice to

such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers or to dry wells.
Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on
approval of the City and Health Department, to dry wells or other disposal
areas.
      3.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
         a.   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid or gas.
         b.   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids,
liquids, organic chemicals or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage disposal
process, constitute any hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance,
or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant,
including but not limited to cyanides in excess of two milligrams per liter (2
mg/L) as CN in the wastes as discharged to the public sewer.
         c.   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment and personnel of the sewage works.
         d.   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper

13.04.100: SEWER USER CHARGES FOR OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, REPLACEMENT
AND DEBT RETIREMENT:
   A.   Purpose: There is hereby established a system of periodic sewer user
charges in order to equitably impose upon all users the costs and expenses of
the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and debt retirement of the
sewer system. The sewer user charges for purposes of computation shall be based
upon: 1) the volume and BOD5 and SS loading of effluent discharged into the
sewer system of the City, 2) the actual and expected costs and expenses of
maintenance, operation, replacement and repair and debt retirement of the sewer
system, and 3) the benefit derived by each building, structure or user by the
sewer system.
   B.   Charges: The monthly cost per ER shall be calculated by dividing the
total annual projected expenditures for operation, maintenance, administration,
bond payment, capital reserve and replacement (hereinafter referred to as TC),
by the summation of the total number of ER x 12. This calculation can be
expressed by the following formula: cost for one ER = TC divided by (total
number of ER x 12).
      1.   The TC shall be calculated at the end of each fiscal year and rates
may be adjusted to reflect the projected costs of the service for the following
fiscal year.
      2.   A single-family residence shall be assessed the cost for one ER.
      3.   The charge for special users, i.e., all users other than single-
family residences, shall be directly proportional to the waste produced from
the special user to that from a single-family residence, except that no charge
shall be less than that for one ER. The charge for special users shall be
calculated as follows:
         a.   For metered users, i.e., water or sewage metered, the monthly
service charge shall be based upon the gallons of water or sewage as measured
by the water or sewage meter reading. The said monthly service charge shall be
calculated as follows: (metered gallons of use previous month divided by 6,750
gallons) x cost for one ER.
         b.   For nonmetered users, or water metered users where the wastewater
reading is not representative of the true sewage flow, the ER shall be
calculated depending on the classification of each special user according to
the following schedule:
      NONMETERED USERS ER SCHEDULE
Mobile home park                 ER = # of spaces
Churches                         ER = 1

 With kitchen and showers        ER = # students x 0.29
Elementary schools:
 Without kitchen                 ER = # students x 0.065
 With kitchen                    ER = # students x 0.125
 With showers                    ER = # students x 0.085
 With kitchen and showers        ER = # students x 0.145
Miscellaneous: Any sewer use that cannot be classified in one of the above
classes shall have its ER computed on an individual basis by the City.
 
         c.   Any user that discharges industrial wastes or produces a flow,
biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solid loading in excess of five percent
(5%) of the average dry weather sewage flow measured at the main interceptor or
at the treatment plant shall be calculated by the City. No quantity discounts
shall be allowed and the City may assess a surcharge on waste flow with
biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids concentrations above two hundred
fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/L).
   C.   Revisions To User Charge:
      1.   Revisions to the user charges shall be based upon actual operation,
maintenance, capital reserve and replacement expenses and/or a change in the
total number of equivalent users, total daily BOD5, total daily SS, and/or
total daily flow to the sewage treatment facilities. The user charge for
operation, maintenance, capital reserve, replacement and bond repayment may be
reviewed annually and updated to reflect actual costs.
      2.   The City may install a measuring device in the sewer service line at
any time to determine the amount of wastewater and/or to collect wastewater
samples for testing. After measuring and/or sampling the City may adjust the
user charge to conform to actual usage.
   D.   Appeals To User Charge:
      1.   Any user feeling aggrieved at the user charge for operation,
maintenance and bond repayment may request that his charge be changed if:
         a.   Flow proportioned BOD5 or SS tests certified by an independent
laboratory specializing in wastewater analysis indicate a significant deviation
in BOD5 and SS from the value used by the City in computing the BOD5 and SS
charge; and/or
         b.   Total daily wastewater flow measurements derived from a
continuously recording measuring device (i.e., water meter) and certified by an
authorized representative of the City as to their authenticity indicate a
significant deviation in wastewater flow charge.
         c.   The flow measurement and testing methods are approved in detail
by the City prior to actual measurement and testing.
      2.   All changes in user charges applicable to this chapter shall be
computed by the method outlined herein.
   E.   Minimum Charge: Each sewer user billed separately shall pay a minimum
charge per month regardless of actual flow. The minimum charge shall be the
charge for one ER as calculated in this section.
   F.   Administrative Fee: Each sewer user billed separately shall pay an
administrative fee which shall, as near as practicable, be equal to the cost of
providing necessary administration services. The fee shall be set by resolution
adopted by the City Council. (Ord. 307 § 1, 1998: Ord. 275 § 2, 1989)
13.04.110: COLLECTION SYSTEM CONNECTION FEES:
   A.   After the effective date of this chapter, the City shall collect from
each potential user, either in advance or at the time a building permit is
issued, the collection system connection fee. The fee shall be in addition to
other permanent fees, sewer line construction costs and sewer user charges as
described in this chapter.
The collection system connection fee (CSCF) related to the operation,
maintenance, repair, replacement, and debt retirement costs of the City's
collection system. This fee also shall be established by resolution of the City
Council, to be reviewed annually and may be changed from time to time. The fee
established shall be per ER and the potential user shall pay the number of ERs
times the fee. (Ord. 275 § 2, 1989)
13.04.120: PENALTY:

State regulation if it is deemed that the conditions do dictate. The City shall
adopt rules and regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 251 § 3, 1983)
13.14.040: USE OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service
connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the City, the
nature and extent of activities, or the material stored on the premises, would
present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health and/or be deleterious to
the quality of the water should a cross-connection occur; even though such
cross- connection does not exist at present, the backflow prevention devices
shall be installed under circumstances including but not limited to the
following:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with the Idaho Drinking Water Regulations and
is acceptable to the City;
      2.   Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross-connections exist;
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross-connections do not exist;
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being
established or reestablished;
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross-connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters;
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard
might result;
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public

         g.   Carwashes;
      8.   Other premises, as specified by the City, where backflow prevention
devices are required to protect the public water supply.
   B.   The type of protective device required shall depend on the degree of
hazard which exists.
      1.   An air-gap separation or a reduced pressure principal backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the public water supply may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard.
      2.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not
hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air-gap separation, or a
reduced pressure principal backflow prevention device shall be installed.
   C.   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed
at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are not used, or
at a location designated by the City. The device shall be located so as to be
readily accessible for maintenance and testing, and furthermore, where no part
of the device shall be submerged.
   D.   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed
under the supervision of, and with the approval of, the Supervisor.
   E.   Any protective device required by this chapter shall be a model
approved by the City. A double check valve assembly or a reduced pressure
principal backflow prevention device will be approved if it has successfully
passed performance tests of the University of Southern California Engineering
Center or other testing laboratories satisfactory to the engineer. These
devices shall be furnished and installed by and at the expense of the customer.

and records thereof shall be accomplished under the City's supervision by
certified testers.
   G.   No underground sprinkling device will be installed without adequate
backflow prevention devices at the point from which the water for irrigation is
taken from the public water supply.
   H.   Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance,
testing or inspection of backflow prevention devices required by this chapter
shall be grounds for the termination of water service to the premises, or, in
the alternative, the installation of an air-gap separation at the customer's
expense. (Ord. 251 § 4, 1983)
13.14.050: CROSS-CONNECTION INSPECTION:
   A.   No water shall be delivered to any structure hereafter built within the
City of Deary or within areas served by City water until the same shall have
been inspected by the City for possible cross-connections and been approved as
being free of same.
   B.   Any construction for industrial or other purposes which is classified
as hazardous facilities pursuant to section
13.14.040 of this chapter, where it is reasonable to anticipate intermittent
cross-connections, or as determined by the City, shall be protected by the
installation of one or more backflow prevention devices at the point of service
from the public water supply or any other location designated by the City.
   C.   Inspections shall be made periodically of all buildings, structures, or
improvements of any nature now receiving water through the City's system, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether cross-connections exist. Such inspections
shall be made by the City. (Ord. 251 § 5, 1983)
13.14.060: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
In the event an improper cross-connection is not corrected within the time
limit set by the City, or in the event the City is refused access to any
property for the purpose of determining whether or not cross-connections exist,
delivery of water to the property shall cease until the deficiency is corrected
to the City's satisfaction. In addition, the City may effect the necessary
repairs or modifications at the expense of the property owner and refuse
delivery of water to the property until the cost thereof shall have been paid.

shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three inch (3") layers
with each layer moistened and thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical
equipment. The backfill around all pipes twenty four inches (24") or less is
diameter shall be flooded or tamped, as specified in subsection A of this
section, to a depth of eighteen inches (18") above the top of the pipe before
any additional backfilling is placed thereon. (Ord. 157 § 460, 1961)
13.16.160: BACKFILLING; WATER-SETTLING; USE OF HYDRANTS FOR PURPOSE:
   A.   When backfilling is done by water-settling, excavations above utility
installations shall be deposited uniformly in layers of not more than five feet
(5') in thickness and shall be thoroughly flooded. During the flooding the
water shall be allowed to flow slowly to the trench from high points and shall
be worked down to the full depth of the layer of backfill with bars. All bars
used shall be long enough to extend entirely through the layer being filled and
shall be forced down through the loose backfill material. As bars are withdrawn
water shall be allowed to flow downward around the bars. The channel or hole
formed by bars shall be kept open and water kept running into it until the fill
has settled. Sufficient hose shall be provided in order to apply water to the
trench at intervals not to exceed one hundred feet (100'). All work shall be
done in a manner as to obtain a relative compact through the entire depth of
the backfill not less than that which exists adjacent to the excavation.
   B.   When water is drawn from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign a
qualified man to operate the hydrant. The permittee shall, upon commencement
and completion of the work, notify the Water Commissioner in order that the
hydrants used may be checked by said Commissioner. The permittee shall pay for
water drawn from the hydrants at the rate established by the Water Department.

shall be the sole responsibility of the permittee. (Ord. 157 § 600, 1961)
13.16.210: CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL:
   A.   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench,
or in highways, shall be piled and maintained in such a manner that the toe of
the slope of the excavated material is at least eighteen inches (18") from the
edge of the trench. When the confines of the area through which the gas pipes
are to be laid are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside
the trench, the permittee may be required to haul excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
   B.   It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary
permission and make all necessary arrangements for all storage and disposal
sites required. (Ord. 157 § 620, 1961)
13.16.220: INTERFERENCE WITH OTHER SERVICES:
The work shall be conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire stations
and fire hydrants. Material or obstructions shall not be placed within fifteen
feet (15') of fire hydrants. Passageways leading to fire escapes or

cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of abutting property
and to the general public; provided, that the Water Commissioner may permit the
closing of highway to all traffic for a designated period of time, if, in his
opinion, it is necessary. Before any highway may be closed or restricted to
traffic, the permittee must obtain the approval of the Water Commissioner and
notify the Chief of the Fire Department and the Chief of the Police Department.
The permittee shall route and control all traffic, including its own vehicles,
as directed by the Chief of the Police Department. Upon completion of
construction work, the Chief of the Police Department and the Chief of the Fire
Department shall again be notified before traffic is returned to its normal
route. When flagmen are deemed necessary by the Chief of the Police Department,
they shall be furnished by the permittee at its expense.
   B.   Through traffic shall be maintained without detours if possible. When
it is necessary to construct a detour, the permittee shall construct same at
its expense in accordance with specifications of the Water Commissioner. The
permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any highway
by the operation of its equipment.
   C.   The permittee shall erect and maintain suitable timber barriers to
confine earth from trenches or other excavations in order to minimize
encroachment upon highways. It shall construct and maintain adequate and safe
crossings over excavations and across highways during construction to
accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections, under
the supervision of the Water Commissioner. Decking shall be not less than four
inches (4") thick and shall be securely fastened together with heavy wire and
staples. Pedestrian crossings shall consist of planking three inches (3")
thick, twelve inches (12") wide and of length required, together with necessary
blocking. The walk shall be not less than four feet (4') wide and shall be
provided with a railing if required by the Water Commissioner. (Ord. 157 § 680,
1961)
13.16.250: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The permittee shall have and maintain in force public liability insurance in
amounts of not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for injury
to one person and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for any one
accident and property damage in an amount not less than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) which policy shall be in force and effect during the
period of the permit. (Ord. 157 § 900, 1961)
13.16.260: VIOLATION; PENALTY:

chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at City Hall. (Ord. 271 § 3.2,
1988)
   ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
14.04.050: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: Means the land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASE FLOOD: Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equalled
or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the 100-year flood.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
DEVELOPMENT: Means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): Means the official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: Means the official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-
floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: Means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOODWAY: Means the channel of a river or other watercourses and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
LOWEST FLOOR: Means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in any area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at subsection
14.04.210B of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: Means a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain
management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term
"manufactured home" does not include park trailers, trailers, travel trailers,
and other similar vehicles.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Means structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement or permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. "Permanent construction" does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
STRUCTURE: Means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. (Ord. 271 § 2, 1988)

available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less). (Ord. 271 § 5.1-4, 1988)
14.04.190: REVIEW OF BUILDING PERMITS:
Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study
or from another authoritative source (section
14.04.100 of this chapter), applications for building permits shall be reviewed
to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The
test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data,
high water, marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure
to elevate at least two feet (2') above grade in these zones may result in
higher insurance rates. (Ord. 271 § 5.1-5, 1988)
14.04.200: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section

following minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings
or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(Ord. 271 § 5.2-1, 1988)
14.04.220: NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:
New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or
other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
   A.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
   B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
   C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted

   E.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood
level will be rated as 1 foot below that level). (Ord. 271 § 5.2-2, 1988)
14.04.230: MANUFACTURED HOMES:
All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-
30, AH and AE, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the wet
floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance
with the provisions of subsection
14.04.150B of this article. (Ord. 271 § 5.2-3, 1988)
14.04.240: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
 14.04.040 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.

unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after
its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or
abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. The
Building Official is authorized to grant, in writing, not more than three
extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 days each. The party must
request an extension and pay the fee as shown in Section 15.04.09.
Renewal. When a permit has expired or is going to expire, a renewal permit must
be obtained. No work can be recommenced on an expired project until a renewal
permit has been issued. The fees for such renewal permits are specified in
Section 15.04.09. At the discretion of the Building Official, and only when
deemed appropriate, in lieu of the fees specifically outlined, the applicant
may be charged the fees set out for remodels or may, if the project is
substantially close to being finished with approximately 90% or more of the
project completed, be charged for individual items or inspections needed to
complete a permit. A Certificate of Occupancy may be issued without all
permitted elements completed provided that these elements are not essential to
the completion of construction of the structure (i.e. garage or carport with a
home, cover over a deck) and so long as construction of the elements has not
begun. If these will be built at a future date, a new permit for these will be
required at the time of construction. All subsequent work, which was not
previously approved, shall adhere to the most current adopted code. No refund
shall be given for partial permit approval.

authorized to issue a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy before the completion
of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that such portion or
portions shall be occupied safely and the corresponding fee for a Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy has been paid. To occupy a structure safely, the
Building Official shall determine what items must be complete and pass
inspection prior to issuance.
The Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, when issued, shall contain a list of
all items remaining for final approval and be signed by the applicant. It shall
be valid for a period of 180 days. An applicant can request and receive, at the
discretion of the Building Official, two (2) one-time 180 extensions of their
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. The fees, as indicated in Section 15.04.09,
for a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy and Temporary Certificate of Occupancy
extension shall be paid prior to issuance or extension. This Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy may be recorded by the Building Official and may be
revoked at any time if a safety hazard is deemed to exist that was not readily
apparent at the time of the issuance.
If a structure is not completed at the time of the expiration of the Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy, a renewal permit shall be required and a Certificate
of Non-Compliance shall be recorded against the structure and shall not be
removed until a valid Certificate of Occupancy has been issued. Enforcement
actions may be taken against the owners of any property when occupying a
structure that has no valid Certificate of Occupancy or Temporary Certificate
of Occupancy.

review fee shall be as shown in Section 15.04.09. A non-refundable fee deposit,
in an amount set forth in Section 15.04.09, for commencement of the plan review

15.04.080: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
The following are available to enforce compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council of Deary or any other
public official or private citizen from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or correct any violation of this Chapter or of the Idaho
Code.
   A.   Injunction: The City may obtain from a District Court having
jurisdiction, an injunction enjoining the construction or installation of
buildings or structures on any building site upon affidavit of the City that
such building or structure does not conform to the requirements of this
chapter. The affidavit must set forth such violations in detail. The injunction
may be made permanent, at the discretion of the court.
   B.   Stop work order: Upon notice from the code official that work is being
performed contrary to the provisions of this code or in a dangerous or unsafe
manner, such work shall immediately cease. Such notice can be in the form of a
letter or placed upon any structure or property where the violation is
occurring. Any person who shall continue any work on the item after having been
served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to
perform by the City to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be liable
for a fine of not less than three hundred dollars ($300) for each day the work
continues.
   C.   Violation Penalties: Any person who willfully violates or fails to
comply with any provisions of this chapter or any provisions of the codes
enumerated in this chapter or rules promulgated by the Administrator of this
chapter or the Board pursuant to this chapter or the codes enumerated in this
chapter, or who, having obtained a permit hereunder, shall willfully fail to
continue to comply with the conditions as set forth herein, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined not more than three hundred
dollars ($300.00), or imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days, or by both
fine and imprisonment. A separate violation is deemed to have occurred with
respect to each building or structure not in compliance with this chapter.
Further, each day such violation continues constitutes a separate offense.
   D.   Work commencing before permit issuance: In addition to any penalties
assessed under Section
15.04.080 of this chapter, any work which is started or proceeded prior to
obtaining a permit or approval to include plan or system approval, which is
required by these rules and/or the codes enumerated in Title 39, Chapter 41,
Idaho Code, where any enforcement action has begun, shall be subject to a fee,
as set forth in Section
15.04.090. Such fee shall be in addition to the required permit and/or approval
fees. The fee for work commenced prior to obtaining any required permit or
approvals shall be double the permit fee for any second or additional offenses
by any person, company, contractor, individual, property owner or the like and
is not dependent on any enforcement action. The payment of such fees shall not
relieve any persons from fully complying with the requirements of Title 39,
Chapters 40 or 41, or both, Idaho Code, or these rules in the execution of the
work, nor from any other penalties as prescribed by law.
   E.   Civil Action: Notwithstanding any other remedies available, any person
damaged as a result of a violation of this chapter or the codes enumerated
herein or promulgated pursuant to this chapter has a cause of action in any
court of competent jurisdiction against the person who committed the violation,
and if such damaged person prevails, they shall be entitled to a reasonable
attorney's fees to be determined by the court, together with court costs.
Further, each day such violation continues constitutes a separate offense.
   F.   Withholding Of Permits: The Building Official may withhold permits,
including building permits and certificates of occupancy, on lots or parcels of
land where a violation of any provision of this Code or the City of Deary
Zoning Ordinance exists, unless the permit being requested is to resolve the
violation(s). The Building Official may also suspend issuance of permits,
including building permits and certificates of occupancy to applicants who have
demonstrated a record of unresolved noncompliance with provisions of this Code.
If a permit is withheld, the Building Official shall refer to the notice and
order that details the violations or any letter sent regarding the City of
Deary Zoning Ordinance. If a notice and order or letter of violation has not
been issued, the Building Official, within thirty (30) days of the denial of a
permit, shall issue a notice and order in accordance with Subsection F of this
Section; or in the case of a violation of the City of Deary Zoning Ordinance,
the City of Deary shall issue a letter detailing the violations in accordance
with the procedures set out in City of Deary Zoning Ordinance.
   G.   Recordation Of Noncompliance: Notwithstanding any other remedies
available, the Building Official may, to ensure that future owners of
properties are put on notice of noncompliance, record with the Latah County
Auditor any letter, document, or item that describes the matter of
noncompliance on a property. This may be done any time after the issue of
noncompliance is discovered.
   H.   Notice of Noncompliant Building or Structure or Other Code Violation:
      1.   Commencement of Proceedings: When the Building Official has
inspected or caused to be inspected any building or structure or property and
has found that such building or structure or property is noncompliant, or the
Building Official is unable to verify compliance because the required
inspections have not been requested and performed, the Building Official shall
commence proceedings to cause the repair or inspection of the building or
structure.
      2.   Notice and Order, and Appeal Process: The Building Official shall
issue a notice and order directed to the record owner of the building or
structure. The notice and order shall contain:
         a.   The street address, if issued, and/or a legal description or
Assessor's parcel number sufficient for identification of the premises upon
which the building or structure is located.
         b.   A statement that the Building Official has found the building or
structure to be noncompliant with a brief and concise description of the
conditions found to render the building or structure noncompliant under the
applicable provisions of the applicable code.
         c.   A statement of the action required to be taken as determined by
the Building Official and that any person having any record title or legal
interest in the building or structure may appeal from the notice and order or
any action of the Building Official to the Board of Appeals, in accordance with
the appeal procedures outlined in this code; and that failure to appeal will
constitute a waiver of all right to an administrative hearing and determination
of the matter.
      3.   Service of Notice and Order: The notice and order shall be mailed by
regular mail, or by any other method of service or delivery at the discretion
to the Building Official, to the owner of the property as shown on the tax
record of the property. The failure of the Building Official to serve any
person having an interest in the property that is not shown on the tax records
of the County shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other
person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation
imposed by the provisions of this Section. The failure of any person to receive
notice as set out in this Subsection F3 shall not affect the validity of any
proceedings taken under this Section.
      4.   Proof of Service: The Building Official shall keep a copy of the
notice and order sent with the records of the noncompliance for the property.
      5.   Recordation of Noncompliance: If compliance is not had with the
order within the time specified therein, and no appeal has been properly and
timely filed, the Building Official shall file in the Office of the County
Recorder a certificate describing the property and certifying:
         a.   That the building or structure is noncompliant; and
         b.   That the owner has been so notified. Whenever the corrections
ordered shall thereafter have been completed or the building or structure
demolished so that it no longer exists on the property described in the
certificate, the Building Official shall file a new certificate with the County
Recorder certifying that the building or structure has been demolished or all
required corrections have been made so that the building or structure is no
longer noncompliant, whichever is appropriate.
   I.   Referral for Further Action: The Building Official shall notify the

15.09.010: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
Adopted under the authority of Idaho Code § 50-301, the purpose of this Chapter
is to set out a uniform addressing system for all of the City of Deary to
maintain a consistent addressing system and records, and to assist with
emergency response and other services. (Ord. 399, 10-12-2022)
15.09.020: STANDARDS FOR CITY ADDRESSING:
   A.   City Clerk for the City of Deary shall issue all addresses within the
city limits of the City of Deary and shall maintain an official City address
list and map.
   B.   Address Standards:
      1.   Road Name and Signs: All public roads shall be named. No road names
shall duplicate existing road names within the City of Deary or a nearby
unincorporated area unless said road is a natural extension of a road named in
an unincorporated area. Any existing duplicated road names shall be corrected
by the City Clerk. The responsible highway district or Idaho Transportation
Department shall install and maintain road name signs at each intersection with
another named road.
      2.   Address Requirements:
         a.   All residential, commercial, and public structures, facilities,
such as commercial storage, RV parks, commercial telecommunications towers,
campgrounds, and community sewage treatment facilities, and all accessory
structures where no primary structure is present, within the City of Deary,
shall be assigned an address.
         b.   Addresses and sub-numbering shall be issued by the City Clerk.
         c.   Addresses shall include the road name established by the
responsible highway district or Idaho Transportation Department or the "Lane"
name established by the City Clerk.
         d.   Each address shall have a three (3) digit number and, when
applicable, sub-numbering as described under Section 15.09.020B.4. of this
ordinance or an "NS" as described under Section 15.09.020B.5. of this
ordinance.
         e.   Addresses shall not be issued to structures or properties which
are not in compliance with State and local laws, including, but not limited to,
the City of Deary Building Code and/or Land Use ordinances.
      3.   Private Lanes: At the expense of the owner(s), private driveways
serving three (3) or more building sites, whether developed or undeveloped, and
regardless of existing addresses currently on the driveway, shall be assigned a
name as a "Lane" under the following circumstances and per the below standards:
         a.   An application for an address, non-standard address, building
permit, or land use permit, which results in a private driveway serving three
(3) or more building sites as noted above, shall trigger the requirement to
name the driveway as a "Lane".
         b.   The "Lane" shall be numbered when turning off the main road with
even numbers to the right and odd numbers to the left, starting at one thousand
(1,000) nearest to the identified main road, with numbers increasing the
farther you get from the road. If in the interest of public safety,
convenience, to keep existing numbers, or for any other reason the City sees as
appropriate, "Lane" numbering may vary from this, so long as the numbering
follows this standard as much as possible, is logical, and will not cause any
confusion for emergency service vehicles.
         c.   The City Council has discretion to choose and issue a name for
the "Lane" without agreement from property owners along the "Lane". If the
property owners utilizing the "Lane" prefer to choose a name, they may submit
to the City Clerk a proposed "Lane" name following these standards:
            (1)   The name cannot be vulgar, profane, or violate any
intellectual property rights protected by law.
            (2)   The name cannot have more than sixteen (16) characters
including spaces.
            (3)   The name cannot match or be similar to any other named road
or "Lane" in the City of Deary in spelling or pronunciation. Use of direction
or preposition is not allowed to differentiate between "Lane" and road or
"Lane" names.
            (4)   The name must be easy to pronounce and spell and not
confusing to emergency services personnel.
            (5)   At a minimum, sixty-six percent (66%) of owners of property
that will have an address issued on the "Lane" must agree, in writing, or on a
form provided to them by the City Clerk, of the new name.
            (6)   A name must be provided to the City Clerk in the time frame
given to the property owners by the City.
            (7)   The City reserves the right to reject any "Lane" name
proposed.
         d.   If a "Lane" has already been named and every current property
owner with an address on said "Lane" wants to rename it, they may make an
application on a form provided by the City Clerk. All expenses to change such
name shall be incurred by the requestors. Fees for renaming the "Lane" shall be
charged and shall be paid at the time of the request. Every property owner with
an address on the ""Lane"" shall sign the application. They may request the
City choose a new name or may submit a name to the Department following the
standards in section 15.09.020C.3.c., except under 15.09.020C.3.c.(5). One
hundred percent (100%) of property owners with an address on the "Lane" must
agree to the new name.
         e.   To ensure that emergency vehicles can find structures and in the
interest of public safety, the City may require, even when no address, non-
standard address, building permit, or land use permit is being requested, that
existing shared private driveways be named and the structures readdressed in
accordance with this Chapter. When this occurs, the City shall bear the expense
for the "Lane" sign and installation thereof. All individual property owners on
a "Lane" are responsible for and shall modify their address numbers on their
homes and their sub-driveways.
      4.   Multiple Homes with One Address Number: Manufactured home
developments, condominiums, townhouses, apartment buildings, accessory cottage
houses, RV parks and the like shall be individually sub-numbered using the
following standards:
         a.   An address sign shall be installed at the comer of the driveway/
intemal road(s) with the road and meet the specifications of section
15.09.020C. of this Chapter for display of the four (4)-digit address number.
         b.   When there are multiple apartment buildings or attached townhouse
type structures, each building/group of buildings shall be designated and
clearly marked with a logical number or letter (such as "Building A" and
"Building B") and shall also be clearly signed along the road, "Lane", or
internal road or driveway.
         c.   Sub-number signs shall be placed on each trailer, condominium,
townhouse, apartment, house or the like or, when applicable, on each space.
         d.   Sub-numbers should generally start at one (1), ten (10), one
hundred (100) or A and continue in a logical fashion, but shall not duplicate
themselves for any primary address.
         e.   Address signs and sub-numbering signs shall meet the standards of
subsection 15.09.020C. of this Chapter, except that on apartments, multi-family
houses, townhouses and the like the numbers/letters shall be located near the
door of the apartment and all numbers shall be clearly visible from the road
(internal or external) that provide access to the structures.
      5.   Non-Standard Addresses: Bare-land that is eligible for a building
pennit or ineligible for a building permit but legally created may be assigned
an address, and accessory structures and structures exempt from building
permits that require a placement pennit where no primary structure is present
shall be assigned an address, which consists of a road name and a three (3)
digit number with the letters "NS" (Non-Standard) on the end. These addresses
shall only be for emergency service purposes and shall not have mail delivery
or be used for voting, vehicle registration, or licensing. The address for
these properties will not be reported to the United States Postal Service by
the City. The application for an address for bare-land will include the Deary
City Code citation regarding the temporary use of property or "permanent living
quarters" and information regarding the limits on building permits/structures
on unbuildable parcels.
      6.   Approach Approvals: Prior to assigning an address, a permanent
approach must be approved by the appropriate highway district or the Idaho
Transportation Department. Approaches for new bare-land addresses and multiple
access driveways must be constructed prior to issuance. Approaches for single-
family residences and accessory structures must be constructed prior to a
certificate of occupancy/completion for the structure. If the approach is not

logical numbers to address new structures in lieu of the above.
      9.   Non-Standard "NS" Conversions: If a structure or use that requires a
standard address is going to be placed upon a property with a non-standard "NS"
address, the owner shall apply for a new address and pay a new address fee. Any
other legal conversions from a non-standard "NS" address to an address for a
structure shall also require a new application and fee.

      1.   Addresses shall be displayed along the named road or "Lane" at the
approved point of the constructed access/approach and on the structure.
      2.   The property owner shall install address signs at any new address
location in a manner that allows those signs to be easily seen from the named
road or "Lane".

driveway (when there is one or more sub driveways) shall be easily visible,
kept free of obstructions and maintained by the property owner.
      4.   When a driveway or internal road accesses more than one residence
and there are sub-driveways, additional address signs that meet the
requirements of this section are required to be placed at the corner of the
primary driveway and the sub-driveway indicating the address assignment for the
structure located on each sub-driveway.
      5.   Signs shall contain numbers and letters that are three inches (3")
tall by two inches (2") wide and they shall be made of reflective material that
contrasts with the background color and are easy to see by emergency personnel,
day, or night.

no more than 5 feet off the ground, on a substantial, maintained support
structure.
      7.   The preferred addressing sign has the top of the sign located at
forty-eight inches (48") high and has a six-inch wide by eighteen inches (6" x
18") long placard made of metallic blue reflective material with metallic white
reflective address numbers placed in the center with the first number of the
address near the top and the last number of the address near the bottom.
   D.   Installation and Maintenance of City Address Signs:
      1.   Maintaining and replacing address signs in accordance with the
standards of this Chapter shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
      2.   The City may order a property owner to replace a damaged or missing

environmental assessment for those areas of critical concern as above noted
along with the preliminary plat applications.
         c.   Content Of Environmental Assessment: The content of the
environmental assessment shall usually be prepared by a team of professionals
that will provide answers to the following questions:
            (1)   What environmental impacts will probably occur (i.e.,
wildlife, plant life, social, economic, physical, etc.) as a result of the
proposed development?
            (2)   What corrective action or alternative plans could be
developed so as not to significantly cause detrimental environmental impact?

   A.   General: Subdivisions shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan, the
"Zoning Ordinance", and other ordinances and regulations of the City. Land
which the Council determines to be unsuitable for subdivision because of poor

   B.   Street Requirements:
      1.   All streets in the subdivision must conform to the Master Plan of
the City.
      2.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street or railroad, the Council may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting containing a nonaccess reservation along
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
      3.   Street right-of-way width is to be measured from property line to
property line. The minimum right-of-way of streets so measured shall be:
 
a. Noncontinuous residential streets serving less than 30 dwelling 56 feet

      5.   Cul-de-sac or dead end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall
not be longer than five hundred feet (500') and shall be provided at the closed
end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least sixty feet
(60') curb face to curb face and a street right-of-way diameter of at least
seventy five feet (75').

will be discouraged.
      8.   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make reasonable
provisions of the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
subdivisions, or their proper projections in future subdividing of adjoining
property. The street and alley arrangement must cause no hardship to owners of
adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide for convenient
access thereto. This arrangement must also provide for continuing a reasonable
number of through utility lines.

      14.   The governing Highway Department in accordance with adopted
standard specifications shall erect street name signs.
      15.   All streets and alleys within the subdivision shall be dedicated
for public use. The dedication of half streets in any subdivision is prohibited
except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in
conformity with the other requirements of these rules and where the Mayor and
Council determine it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other
half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there is an existing
half street right-of-way adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half
of the street right-of-way shall be platted within such new tract.
      16.   Concrete sidewalks shall be a minimum of forty inches (40") (per
standard ordinance) in width and may be required to be wider in areas near
shopping centers, schools, along arterial streets or where conditions may
warrant a greater width.
   C.   Easements:

boundaries where necessary for surface drainage or for the extension of main
sewers or other utilities.
      2.   An easement of not less than ten feet (10') in width shall be
dedicated along exterior boundaries where no easements exist on the adjoining
property.
      3.   A general utility and right-of-way easement of not less than five
feet (5') in width shall be dedicated along all front lot lines in cul-de-sacs
and where street rights-of-way are less than sixty feet (60') in width.
      4.   Easements for pedestrian walkways or bicycle paths shall be provided
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping areas, or high pedestrian traffic areas. Walkways shall
have a minimum width of five feet (5') and shall be improved with a concrete
walk over the full width of the easement.
   D.   Blocks:
      1.   The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to adequate sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use
contemplated; the zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions; the need
for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; and
the limitations and opportunities of topography.
      2.   Block lengths shall not exceed six hundred sixty feet (660')
measured from the center line of intersections.
   E.   Lots:
      1.   All lots shown on the subdivision plat must conform to the minimum
requirements of the zoning regulations.
      2.   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial
to the street lines unless a variation will give a better street and lot plan
as determined by the City. All intersecting property lines at a street
intersection corner shall be connected by a curve having a minimum radius of
twenty feet (20').
      3.   Double frontage lots shall be prohibited except where unusual
topography or other conditions make it impossible to meet this requirement.
      4.   All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after the
subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than

street.
      3.   Existing off site storm drainage facilities or off site facilities
proposed by the subdivider shall have sufficient capacity to handle the
stormwater runoff from the proposed subdivision and other tributary areas
resulting from a storm having a 10-year return frequency. If the above
condition is not met, the rate of stormwater runoff from the proposed
subdivision shall not exceed the rate of stormwater runoff from the subdivision
area, which existed prior to preliminary platting. (Ord. 325 §§ 1, 2, 2003:
Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.080: IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:

The owner and/or subdivider shall retain a licensed professional engineer who
shall supervise the construction inspection, certify that all improvements were
constructed in accordance with the approved improvement drawings and City
standards and furnish the City a set of reproducible "as built" improvement
drawings complete with ties to all water valves and service connections. The
City shall be notified when construction begins on any of the improvements
listed in section
16.04.080 of this chapter and prior to performing utility line pressure tests.
Any improvements deemed unsatisfactory by the City Engineer shall be corrected
at the subdivider's expense. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.100: SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT:
The developer shall enter into a subdivision improvement agreement delineating
the improvements to be made, when they are to be completed and how they will be
secured with the City prior to commencing development of the subdivision. (Ord.
311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.110: BONDING AND ONE YEAR GUARANTEE:
A right-of-way permit shall be obtained for construction within a recorded
right-of-way. A right-of-way or a building permit shall be issued only if the
requirements of this Code have been complied with and the proposed improvements
are covered by a surety bond or approved letter of credit. A surety bond
written by a surety company authorized to do business in the State or an
approved letter of credit in an amount equal to one hundred twenty five percent
(125%) of the estimated cost of the improvements not previously installed shall
be filed with the City Clerk. The improvements so covered shall be constructed
within two (2) years from the date of recording of the final plat; provided,
the Council may extend the period one year upon showing of just cause by the
subdivider. The owner and/or subdivider shall guarantee all improvements within
the public right-of-way for a one year period following the date of final
inspection and acceptance by the City. Any defects, repairs or maintenance
during the one year guarantee period due to faulty workmanship or materials
shall be corrected at the expense of the owner and/or subdivider. (Ord. 311 §
1, 1999)
16.04.120: DEDICATIONS:
All streets, alleys and required easements within the subdivision must be
dedicated for public use (exceptions may be granted for planned unit
developments). Dedication of all other public open space within the subdivision
will be required in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the City. Where
this plan calls for a larger amount of public space than the subdivider can be
reasonably expected to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider's fair
contribution is to be reserved for acquisition by the City, provided such
acquisition is made within five (5) years from the date of approval. (Ord. 311
§ 1, 1999)
16.04.130: AMENDED PLATS:
Amended plats must be filed as per the original. In the event a plat of a
subdivision has been recorded and major changes have been made which change the
subdivision materially, the subdivision upon which these changes have been made
must be vacated and an amended plat filed in accordance with the regulations
established in this Code. Any change in street location shall require an
amended plat for that portion that is affected. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.140: EXCEPTIONS MADE TO AVOID HARDSHIPS:
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is, in the opinion of the Council, of such
unusual shape or size, or is surrounded by such development or unusual
conditions, that the strict application of the requirements contained herein
would result in real difficulties and substantial hardships or injustices, the
Council may vary or modify such requirements by an official entry in the
minutes of the Council proceedings so that the subdivider is allowed to develop
his property in a reasonable manner, but so, at the same time, the public
welfare and interests of the City and surrounding area are protected and the
general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved.
The fact that an owner could realize a greater financial return from his
property by subdividing said property contrary to these regulations is not
sufficient reason for hardship. Hardship cannot be claimed where it can be
shown that property was purchased with the knowledge of existing restrictions,
nor can hardship be claimed in terms of prospective sales or potential
customers. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.150: VACATION OF PLAT:
A plat filed under the provisions of this chapter may be vacated in accordance
with Idaho Code 50-1317 through 50-1325. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.160: FEES:
   A.   Persons filing preliminary and/or final subdivision plats shall pay to
the City a fee in an amount to be established by the Council.
   B.   Prior to final plat approval, a certified check shall be paid to the
City or Highway District having jurisdiction of the subdivision streets an
amount specified by the Council to cover the material and installation cost of
street and traffic signs for the subdivision. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
16.04.170: PENALTIES:
Violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person, firm or
corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter or failing to
comply with any of its requirements, upon conviction thereof shall be fined not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned in the County Jail not
more than six (6) months, or both such fine and imprisonment. Each day that
such violation or failure to comply continues shall be deemed a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Council or any other public
official or private citizen from taking such lawful action as is necessary to
restrain, abate or prevent any violation of, or failure to comply with, any
provision of this chapter. Any person who attempts to violate any of the
provisions of this chapter or attempts to fail to comply with any of its
requirements, but fails, or is prevented or interrupted in the perpetration
thereof is punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) or imprisonment in the County Jail of not more than three (3) months
or by both such fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1999)
