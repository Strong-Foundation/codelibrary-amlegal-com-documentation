7-3-7: ROAD NAMING STANDARDS:
   A.   It is hereby established that the following rules and regulations for
the naming of roads shall apply. All official road names shall be assembled in
the Power County Road Name List. Additions and amendments to the list shall be
made by the Building Administrator. All new road names or changes to names
shall be established in accordance with the standards and procedures
hereinafter set forth.
      1.   Approving Standards: The following standards shall be used in
determining and approving road names:
         a.   All proposed road names shall be submitted to the Building
Administrator for review and approval.
         b.   Road names should be easy to communicate (e.g., across electronic
communication devices) and shall not be offensive to the standards of good
taste.
         c.   There shall be no duplication of names by sound or spelling
(example: Briar Road, Brier Road).
         d.   Variations of the same name with a different road designation
shall be prohibited within the first word of the two-word title or in the road
extension (example: Pine Road, Pine Drive, White Pine Road, White Lilly Lane).
         e.   When a proposed road is in general alignment with an existing
road, and the proposed road is or planned to be a continuation of the existing
road, the existing name and designation should be maintained.
         f.   Where a proposed street connects, or aligns with, two (2)
different streets each having different names, the Building Administrator shall
decide the name to be used, giving consideration to the length, classification,
period of usage and number of residents affected. Both "L" shaped and "T"
shaped roads should carry the same name if either leg is one hundred feet
(100') or less in length. "L" shaped and "T" shaped roads over one hundred feet
(100') in length each should carry a different name on each leg of the "L" or
the "T". This determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis.
         g.   In general, road names should consist of no more than three (3)
words or contain over sixteen (16) letters in length including spaces, unless
otherwise approved by the Building Administrator. The road direction (N., S.,
E., W.) and designation (e.g., street, lane, court, etc.) is not included. All
names should conform to this limitation except where existing names are to be
continued due to alignments.
         h.   There shall be no duplication of existing names. Power County
shall assemble, update, and maintain an official list of all road names
throughout the County for use by all jurisdictions.
         i.   No road shall have more than one name.
         j.   No road name shall contain the words north, south, east, or west,
or any combination thereof, within the road name.
      2.   New Roads Or Existing Unnamed Roads:
         a.   Any new road to be established within the County, public or
private, or any existing unnamed road, public or private, shall require a road
name approved by the Building Administrator and/or the GIS Specialist.
         b.   In the case of plats, approved road names shall be specified on
the final plat map.
         c.   In the case of other new roads or naming of unnamed roads, the
owner or owners and/or contract buyers of properties abutting said road may
petition, in writing on a form provided by the County, to the Building
Administrator and/or the GIS Specialist, a request to officially name a road.
            (1)   If the owners present a petition bearing the signatures of at
least fifty one percent (51%) of the property owners (excluding Federal, State,
public utilities and Municipal lands) whose properties abut the road, the road
shall be officially named. Property owners who own more than one property
abutting a road shall only have one vote. The Building Administrator shall
notify by first class mail all property owners along the road. Tax assessment
records shall be used for owner address information.
            (2)   If the petition bears the signatures of less than fifty one
percent (51%) of the owners whose property abuts the road, the name shall be
temporary. Property owners shall have thirty (30) days to respond. If there is
no response from the property owner during the thirty (30) day period, the
County shall consider this as an approval by the property owner. The Building
Administrator shall give due consideration to any and all road name petitions,
only after all road naming requirements of this chapter are met. The Building
Administrator shall officially designate the road name having the greatest
percentage of approval in the event a fifty one percent (51%) approval is not
obtained.
         d.   In cases where the property owners have not petitioned, as
outlined in subsection A2c of this section, the Building Administrator shall
choose an unduplicated road name. Notice shall be given to the property owners
by first class mail. Tax assessment records shall be used for owner address
information. Property owners shall have thirty (30) days to respond with their
appeal if they dispute the chosen name. If no adverse response from more than
fifty one percent (51%) of the ownership is received within the thirty (30) day
period, the Building Administrator shall officially name the road.
      3.   Changing Name Of Roadway: If any person or entity, who shall be
hereinafter referred to as "applicant", shall desire to change the name of any
County roadway that has previously been given an official name, as set out
herein, or by any subsequent action of this Board, then the following procedure
shall apply:
The applicant shall first give notice of his or her desire to secure a name
change for an existing County roadway by filling out and filing with the County
Building Administrator an application for a change of name of an existing named
County road on a form to be provided to the applicant by said Administrator.
Said form shall contain provisions requiring the applicant to comply with the
provisions of subsection A3a of this section. The applicant shall accompany
said application with a deposit of three hundred dollars ($300.00). A statement
will be supplied to the applicant along with any unused portion of deposit
after procedural process.
         a.   Applicant Responsible For Expense Of Changing Name: As a
condition of approving said application, the commission shall assess against
the applicant the expense that will be incurred by the County in updating the
County computer to reflect the name change on all County addresses and to
reprint the rural addressing book, maps, indices, pages requiring revision and
installing all new road signs. No ordinance incorporating the requested change
shall be published until the fees so calculated are paid.

Commission meeting, the applicant shall be invited to appear and to informally
present his or her reasons for requesting a County road name change.
            (3)   Public Hearing Scheduled: If a majority of the commission
members at said meeting feel the reasons advanced justify the calling of a
public hearing on the proposed name change, a public hearing shall then be
scheduled.
            (4)   Hearing Notice:
               (A)   Newspaper: Public notice shall be given fifteen (15) days
in advance of said hearing.
               (B)   Agenda Posted To Website: Agenda shall be posted on Power

               (E)   Testimony At Hearing; Render Decision: At said public
hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall receive testimony and
evidence in favor of and opposed to the renaming of said roadway. Following the
conclusion of said hearing and within forty five (45) days after the conclusion
of the hearing, the commission shall render a decision as to whether or not the
requested name change should be granted. (Ord. 2018-08, 12-3-2018)
7-3-8: ADDRESSING PROCEDURES:
   A.   Addressing Procedure:
      1.   General: All address numbers shall conform to the addressing system
outlined by this chapter. The general standards to be used in developing an
address are as follows:
         a.   The address system shall be based on a mileage system by
measuring to the 1,000th of a mile. The point of beginning for each road shall
be at the point of take-off from another road (example: If the measurement from
the beginning of the road [Sunnyside Rd] to a driveway is 1.568 miles, the
address would be 1568 Sunnyside Rd).
         b.   Addressing for State highways shall be based on mile markers
(example: If a driveway is on Highway 2 and it is between mile marker 18 and 19
and the measurement from mile marker 18 to the driveway is 0.425 miles, the
address for this driveway is 18425 Highway 2).
         c.   A standard of one thousand (1,000) addressing units per mile is
hereby established.
         d.   Even numbers shall be used on the left hand side of the road, and
odd numbers should be used on the right hand side of the road.
      2.   Roads:
         a.   If a building has a number of entrances, each serving separate
occupants, then the building shall be assigned an address and the individual
units assigned unit numbers (example: 24 Birch Rd, Suite 3).
         b.   An addressing scheme for multi-family dwelling structures shall
be approved by the Building Administrator and/or the GIS Specialist that is in
accord with the standards and guidelines outlined in this section.
         c.   In general, a multi-family dwelling structure with one main
entrance should be assigned one number with the owner of the structure
responsible for providing designated individual numbering of each unit before
an address will be issued to the structure (example: 15864 Maas Loop, Apt 101).
In some cases where there are several multi-family dwelling structures sharing
one main access, it may be necessary to name the streets within the complex and
provide individual street numbers to the buildings. This determination will be
made by the Building Administrator and/or the GIS Specialist on a case-by-case
basis.
         d.   An addressing scheme for mobile home parks structures shall be
approved by the Building Administrator and/or the GIS Specialist that is in
accord with E-9-1-1 addressing standards. In general, mobile home parks should
have names for the streets within the complex and individual street numbers
should be assigned by the County for each mobile home space. Alphanumeric
combinations shall not be used for numbering individual spaces.
         e.   If a road or driveway accesses three (3) or more properties, it
shall be assigned a road name and the parcels shall be addressed in accordance
with this chapter.
         f.   Parcels with structure(s), or bare land parcels, which are
accessed by a driveway, shall be assigned an address at the point where the
driveway intersects a named road.
         g.   The street name and address for any dwelling should be determined
by the street on which the dwelling fronts. However, in those instances where
access is from a different street and the dwelling is not visible from the
fronting street, or if the dwelling is not readily accessible to emergency
personnel from the fronting street, the street name and address will be
assigned based on the access street.
         h.   For parcels that are accessed by multiple driveways, the owner
shall designate a primary access point that will be used for address
assignment. Such access points are subject to review and approval of the County
to ensure that they are accessible to emergency service providers. If the
property owner does not designate a primary access point, the County shall make
the official determination to allow the proper addressing of the property.
         i.   Circular and loop roads should begin numbering at the low
numbered intersection, with odd and even numbers following the set standard.
         j.   For circle roads, the numbering should begin at its origin and
proceed in a counterclockwise direction around the circle using a consecutive
numerical order and odd/even numbers consistent with the beginning of the road
as if the road were straight.
         k.   Parcels served by a common driveway that access two (2) parcels
should be assigned an address at the point where the access intersects a public
or private road or named common driveway. Each property shall be assigned a
different address. If the County issues multiple addresses to a parcel pursuant
to this section, the County may also require that the common driveway be named
in the same manner as private roads.
         l.   Fractional addresses (56981/2 Happy Trail Road) and hyphenated
address numbers (632-58 Kennedy) shall not be used.
         m.   Parcels with multiple structures will be addressed on a case- by-
case basis.
      3.   Waterfront:
         a.   A shoreline distance based system may be used by the emergency
service agencies to assign numerical points to facilitate emergency responses.
These waterfront response identification numbers shall not be used as addresses
except for those parcels that do not have any access other than by water.
         b.   Waterfront response identification numbers should be based on a
shoreline distance measurement. Starting points shall be established at a
readily identified point on the waterbody and numbered consecutively. Odd and
even numbers may occur along the same shore.
            (1)   Limitation except where existing names are to be continued
due to alignments. (Ord. 2018-08, 12-3-2018)
7-3-9: SIGNAGE:
   A.   Signage:
      1.   Physical Addresses: Physical address numbers should be clearly
readable from the roadway, and should contrast with background. If a structure
is more than seventy five feet (75') from the road, or is otherwise not clearly
visible from the road, its address should be posted at the intersection of its
access road and public or private road. The address sign should be no less than
four feet (4') nor more than six feet (6') above the ground and mounted on
support structure. The view of the address from the road must be unobstructed
and maintained. All primary letters, numbers and symbols should be a minimum of
three and one-half inches (31/2") in height, with a one-half inch (1/2")
stroke, and should contrast with the background color. Power County shall not
be liable for any damage to the address sign and support structure. Power
County shall not be liable for any damage caused by the installation of the
address sign and support structure.
      2.   Water Response Identification Numbers:
         a.   Where a water response identification number is used as an
address for a parcel, the number should be posted on a pier, dock or other
waterfront appurtenance, no less than four feet (4') nor more than six feet
(6') above the ground or high water line. The sign must be clearly readable to
emergency providers arriving by boat.
         b.   In cases where the waterfront response identification number is
not used as an address (where road access is available and a road address has
been issued), the waterfront response identification number should be posted in
accordance with the policies of the emergency service providers. (Ord. 2018-08,
12-3-2018)
7-3-10: ROAD SIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   General: Road signs shall be placed in accordance with Power County
Highway District Standards to be clearly visible at intersections. All primary
letters, numbers, and symbols shall be a minimum of four inches (4") in height,
with a one-half inch (1/2") stroke, and shall be reflectorized and contrasting
with the background color of the sign in accordance with the "Manual On Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)". Specifically, public road signs shall be
green with white lettering. Private road signs shall be blue with white
letters. All public and private road signs shall be constructed and installed
to the standards of the Power County Highway District Standards or responsible
local road jurisdiction. Signs shall be installed within one hundred twenty
(120) days of notice of approval of the street name or before any construction
starts on any structure accessed by that street, whichever is later.
   B.   Installation Standards: Proper positioning of signs is essential to
obtain maximum safety, efficiency and observance. Signs should be installed in
accord with the corresponding public and private roads standards along with
standards listed within the "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD)". (Ord. 2018-08, 12-3-2018)

FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this Chapter found at subsection
9-1-6B1b of this Chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain
management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term
"manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other
similar vehicles.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date hereof.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,

structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. (Ord. 87-03, 6-22-
1987)

provisions of this Chapter.
      3.   Alteration Of Watercourses:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
         b.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is
not diminished.
      4.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where
needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of
section 61 of the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program
(44 CFR 59-76). (Ord. 87-03, 6-22-1987; amd. 1998 Code)
9-1-6: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
standards are required:
      1.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
      2.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air- conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
      3.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
         b.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
         c.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      4.   Subdivision Proposals:
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
         d.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available for another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
      5.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source,
applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed
construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness
is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks,
photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at
least two feet (2') above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance
rates.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection 9-1-3B of
this Chapter, "Basis For Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard", the
following provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
base flood elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection 9-1-5B2b of this Chapter.
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection B1b of this Section.
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base
flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).
      3.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation systems in accordance with the provisions of subsection A1b
of this Section.
   C.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection 9-1-3B of this Chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection C1 above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this Section. (Ord. 87-03, 6-22-1987)

10-1-4: IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT IN PROCESS AND EXISTING USES:
   A.   Conflicting Ordinances Repealed: All prior County ordinances are
repealed to the full extent of their inconsistency with this title.
   B.   Vested Rights: A vested right is the right to proceed with development
that was under construction or had obtained some form of final approval from
the County before the effective date hereof. Vested rights to proceed with
development initiated prior to the adoption of these regulations shall be
established by:
      1.   Having obtained a building permit in full compliance with previous
ordinances (such vested rights expire with the permit); or
      2.   Having obtained approval of a preliminary plat or conditional use
permit in full compliance with previous ordinances (such vested rights expire
with the approval or permit); or
      3.   Having recorded a final plat in full compliance with previous
ordinances.
      4.   Approval of a preliminary plat or recording of a final plat
establishes a vested right to the lot layout and road network design of the
subdivision. It does not establish a vested right for the development of any
lot.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses And Buildings: A nonconforming use or building is
one that was in compliance with all applicable regulations at the time it was
initiated or constructed, but that would not comply with one or more
requirements of this title, if presented for approval after its effective date.
Nonconforming uses and buildings may continue subject to the rules established
herein.
      1.   Any nonconforming use abandoned for more than twelve (12) months
shall be terminated. Abandonment shall not be measured by the owner's intent,
but solely by the fact that use ceases for a period of twelve (12) or more
months.
      2.   There shall be no limit on repair or maintenance activities for
nonconforming uses or buildings, but no such activity shall increase the degree
of nonconformity, except where the Administrator permits a minor increase in
nonconformity to provide handicapped access to a structure, as required by law.
Repair and maintenance of nonconforming buildings will be subject to the
requirements of the International Existing Building Code.
      3.   Changes in occupancy may be permitted in nonconforming commercial or
industrial buildings, provided that the new occupancy is no more intense (with
intensity being measured by traffic and noise generation, parking requirements,
and similar factors) than the existing. Requests for such changes in
nonconforming occupancies shall be processed as applications for a special use
permit.
      4.   Nonconforming buildings may be replaced, but only where the effect
of the replacement is to lessen the adverse impact of the nonconformity on the
County and the degree of nonconformity is not increased. Requests for
replacement of nonconforming buildings shall be processed as applications for
special use permits, except that any nonconforming building destroyed by fire
or other catastrophe may be replaced without a special use permit if the degree
of nonconformity is not in any way increased and the replacement is completed
within twelve (12) months of the building's destruction. There may be
additional restrictions on the replacement of nonconforming buildings in the
Airport Safety or Floodplain Overlay Districts.
      5.   A "nonconforming lot" is one that existed in distinctly separate
ownership on or before the date this title was adopted, but that is not large
enough to be further divided in compliance with this title. All nonconforming
lots may be divided once, provided that both parcels created are one acre in
size or larger, and capable of accommodating a use that is otherwise in full
compliance with this title.
   D.   Impact On Private Agreements: This title does not nullify easements,
covenants, deed restrictions, and similar private agreements, but where any
such private agreement imposes standards that are less restrictive than those
of this title, this title shall govern. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

LOCAL PLANNING ACT: Idaho Code title 67, chapter 65 Local Land Use Planning
refers to sections 67-6501 through 67-6537, and subsequent amendments.
LOT: "Lot" is used as both a generic term for a development site, and to refer
to any parcel of land created and described by a record of survey or plat.
LOT COVERAGE: The percent of the lot covered by structures, including the main
and all accessory buildings, and impervious surfaces, including patios, drives,
and walks.

enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this Chapter found at subsection
9-1-6B1b of this Chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain
management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,

one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term
"manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other
similar vehicles.
MINE: A "mine" includes both the extraction of a mineral resource from the
earth and its initial processing, including sorting and crushing. The
conversion of a mineral resource to another form (i.e., smelting, burning) is
an industrial activity, and must be located in an Industrial Zoning District. A
"surface mine", as defined by the Idaho Board of Land Commissioners, is an area
where minerals are extracted by removing the overburden lying above and
adjacent to natural deposits thereof and mining directly from the natural
deposits thereby exposed.
MINOR UTILITY INSTALLATIONS: Includes cable television, electric power, and
telephone cables and transmission lines, and natural gas pipelines that serve
the area through which they are routed. Also includes transformer boxes and

PERSONAL WIND TURBINE: Total height is less than one hundred fifty feet (150')
and the nameplate is less than one hundred (100) kilowatts.
PLAT: The legal map of a subdivision.
PUBLIC NUISANCE: The unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful use of one's
property in a manner that substantially interferes with the enjoyment or use of
another individual's property, without an actual trespass or physical invasion
to the land. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER: A "potentially affected public service provider" is
any local agency, including special districts that provides any public facility
or service that may possibly be affected by a proposed development. State law
specifically states that school districts are potentially affected public
service providers.
PZC: The Planning and Zoning Commission of Power County.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: As per Idaho Code section 49-119, "recreational vehicle"
means a motor home, travel trailer, fifth- wheel trailer, park model
recreational vehicle, truck camper or folding camping trailer, with or without
motive power, designed for recreational or emergency occupancy. It does not
include pick-up hoods, shells, or canopies designed, created or modified for
occupational usage. School buses or van type vehicles which are converted to
recreational use, are defined as recreational vehicles.
RESERVOIR HIGH WATER MARK: The "reservoir high water mark" shall be at
elevation 4,354.5 feet above mean sea level USC and GS datum. (Refer to the
Spaceholder Contract among the United States Bureau of Reclamation), the
American Falls Reservoir District, and the Falls Irrigation District for

Operation and Maintenance of the American Falls Replacement Dam Program, 14-06-
100-851 S, revision dated April 24, 1980, part IV article 25, page 28,
paragraph (e) item (2) which says, "The water surface elevation of the
replacement dam shall not exceed a maximum of 4,354.5 feet above mean sea level
USC and GS datum".
RESOURCE-RELATED RECREATION: Resource-related recreational uses, as permitted
in the A Zoning District, include facilities like spas associated with hot
springs and cross-country ski centers and guest ranches: i.e., those that must
be in a rural area to take advantage of the natural setting for recreation. For
example, a bowling alley or amusement park is not a resource-related
recreational facility.
SETBACK: The minimum distance between the property line and the outer wall, at
grade, or any above grade extension, of the principal building on the same lot.
The space within that distance is called a "yard".
   A.   The front setback is measured from the lot line paralleling a public
street to the principal building. Corner lots have two (2) front yards.
   B.   The rear setback is measured from the rear lot line to the principal
building. The rear lot line is parallel, or more or less parallel, to the
street. Corner lots have two (2) rear yards, but may treat either as a side
yard for the purposes of this title.
   C.   The side setback is measured from the side lot line to the principal
building.
SIGN: Any object or structure used to identify, advertise, or in any way
attract or direct attention to any use, building, person, or product by any
means, including, but not limited to, the use of lettering, words, pictures,
and other graphic depictions or symbols. Specific types of signs are defined in
section
10-17-1, appendix A of this title.
SILVICULTURE: The cultivation (but not processing) of trees, including
planting, thinning, and harvesting.
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING: A detached structure designed for occupancy by one
family. Also includes, as required by Idaho Code sections 67-6530 through 6532,
"any home in which eight (8) or fewer unrelated mentally and/or physically
handicapped persons reside: and which is supervised". Includes both
conventional dwellings and manufactured homes that:
   A.   Comply with the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety
Standards Act (USC 5407 - 5426) HUD Manufactured House Construction Safety Act
of 1974 or the International Building Code;
   B.   Have all hitches, wheels, chassis, and other running gear removed and
are attached to a permanent foundation; and
   C.   Are permanently connected to on site or central utilities. Recreational
vehicles and travel trailers shall not be used as single-family dwellings,
except that a recreational vehicle or travel trailer may be used as a temporary
dwelling to replace a home destroyed by fire or other catastrophe for a period
of up to one year.
Exception: Manufactured homes placed in the Agricultural Zoning District need
not have all hitches, wheels, chassis and other running gear removed, or be
attached to a permanent foundation.
A "manufactured home" is a structure, manufactured pursuant to the authority of
42 USC 5407 - 5426 (the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety
Standards Act), that is transportable in one or more sections, and which in the
traveling mode is eight (8) body feet or more in width or forty (40) body feet
or more in length or, when erected on site, is three hundred twenty (320) or
more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be
used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities.
SITE PLAN: A site plan illustrates all those details of a proposed development
needed to demonstrate compliance with this title, including the location of
existing and proposed property lines, easements, buildings, parking areas and
points of access to streets, streets, sidewalks, buffers and other measures
designed to mitigate potential nuisances, signs, and other features of the
site.
SKETCH PLAN: A general or conceptual site plan of a development. It must
include the approximate location of all lot lines and streets, the approximate
location and exterior dimensions of all structures, the approximate location,
size, and circulation pattern of all parking areas, and the approximate
location and dimensions of all landscaped buffers.
SOLID WASTE: Material being stored, packaged, or processed for ultimate
disposal or recycling. Does not include crop stubble, manure, or other
agricultural residues on the site on which they were produced. Does not include
scrap materials used for erosion control or bank stabilization purposes.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
STRUCTURE: Any object, including any mobile object, constructed or installed by
man, including, without being limited to, buildings, towers, tanks, cranes,
smokestacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines.
SUBDIVISION: Division of a parcel into four (4) or more parcels of less than
twenty (20) acres each for the purpose of sale, lease, rental, or development.
A "minor subdivision" includes ten (10) or fewer lots and involves no
dedication of public ways. The minimum lot size for a permitted residence is
one acre. Certain land divisions are exempt from the permit requirements or
this title; see subsection 10-2-2B of this title.
Exception: subdivisions of less than one acre which may require central sewer
systems or division of a parcel into three (3) or fewer lots.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. (Ord. 87-03, 6-22-
1987)
TOTAL HEIGHT: Total height of a wind turbine shall be determined by using a
measurement which includes the total height of the structure plus the maximum
size of the rotor radius.
USE: See definition of occupancy.
VARIANCE: According to Idaho Code section 67-6516, "A variance is a
modification of the requirements of the ordinance as to lot size, lot coverage,
width, depth, front yard, side yard, rear yard, setbacks, parking space, height
of buildings, or other ordinance provision affecting the size or shape of
structure or the placement of the structure upon lots, or the size of lots".
Land use cannot, by definition, be varied. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
WIND FARM: A wind energy conversion system which converts wind energy into
electricity through the use of a wind driven turbine generator. A system shall
be deemed to be a "wind farm" or a "large" or "commercial" project if it
consists of one or more wind turbines exceeding one hundred fifty feet (150')
or one hundred (100) kilowatt nameplate capacity on the same or adjoining
parcels. A "wind farm" or "large" project shall be required to meet the same
criteria as a "commercial" project for the purposes of this chapter. Large or
commercial wind conversion systems shall be required to follow the same
criteria as set out herein for personal wind turbines as well as the commercial
wind turbines. In the event of a conflict in regulations, the commercial
section shall be the controlling section.
WIND TURBINE: Any machine used to produce electricity by converting the kinetic
energy of wind to electrical energy. Wind turbines consist of the entire
turbine apparatus and any other buildings, support structures or other related
improvements necessary for the generation of electric power. (Ord. 2010-01, 10-
26-2009; amd. Ord. 2020-02, 2-24-2020)
10-1-6: LAND USE CATEGORY SUMMARY:
Where text and chart may differ, the text will prevail. Because no list can be

   B.   Exemptions For Land Divisions: No permit shall be required for land
divisions resulting from the following activities:
      1.   An adjustment of lot lines shown on a recorded plat that does not
reduce the area, frontage, width, depth, or building setback lines on any lot
below the minimum requirements of this title, and does not change the original
number of lots shown on the plat.
      2.   An allocation of land in the settlement of an estate, or as a result
of a court decree for the distribution of specific parcels of property.
      3.   A gift of land for public purposes, an unwilling sale of land as a
result of condemnation, or the acquisition of street rights- of-way or other
public ways or spaces by a public agency.
      4.   An exchange of land for the purpose of straightening adjacent
property boundaries which does not result in a change in land use.
      5.   Any division in which three (3) or fewer parcels created or
remaining are more than twenty (20) acres or less than forty (40) acres in size
or any division in which all parcels created or remaining are more than forty
(40) acres in size and for which said division does not involve the dedication
of streets or other public ways or spaces.
      6.   The creation of cemetery lots.
      7.   State law may require a record of survey for some activities
exempted by this title.
   C.   Exemptions For Construction Activity: Activities listed here shall
comply with all requirements of this title. However, no permit shall be
required for:
      1.   Excavation or grading for agricultural purposes, or that is exempt
from the requirements of the International Building Code, except where such
excavation or grading is for the purpose of mining, which is not permitted in
some zoning districts, or within the Floodplain Overlay District, where all
grading and excavation is subject to permit.
      2.   Repair or remodeling that does not alter the exterior dimensions of
the building involved by more than six inches (6").
      3.   Accessory buildings that are also exempted from review by the IBC
(note that this generally exempts accessory buildings with a roof area of less
than 120 square feet with 1 story and have no human occupancy), except where
such accessory buildings are located in the Airport Safety or Floodplain
Overlay Districts.
      4.   Fences under six feet (6') in height are exempted from review by the
IBC.
      5.   Minor utility installations, except where such installations are in
the Airport Safety or Floodplain Overlay Districts.
      6.   Certain signs, as provided in section
10-17-1, "Appendix A, Signs", of this title.
      7.   The IBC may require a building permit for some activities exempted
by this title.
   D.   Application Forms: Applications shall be submitted on forms provided by
the County. Multiple copies of applications and supporting materials, including
a site plan, may be required by the Administrator. Applications shall contain
all information required to demonstrate compliance with this title and no
incomplete application shall be accepted.
   E.   Application Fees: Application fees for each type of permit established
by this title shall be established by resolution of the BOCC.
   F.   Lot Split Permits: The lot split permit procedure is designed to assure
that the creation of new parcels of land does not result in violation of this
title or unnecessary applications for variances. County review of proposed lot
splits also helps protect utility easements and streets from encroachment and
consumers from purchasing inaccurately described property. Applications for lot
split permits shall follow the procedure described herein. An application for a
lot split permit may be submitted and processed simultaneously with an
application for a development permit or combined into an application for a
special use permit, in which case it shall be approved or disapproved by the
PZC along with the application for the special use permit.
      1.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form,
including a record of survey, the required supporting materials, and the
required application fee with the Administrator.
      2.   The Administrator shall determine whether the proposed lot split is
in compliance with the comprehensive plan and this title. If he/she finds that
the proposed lot split complies, the application for a permit shall be
approved. If he/she finds that the proposed lot split does not comply, the
application for a permit shall be disapproved. Conditions may be attached to
approval of the permit, as provided in subsection J of this section.
      3.   The Administrator shall notify the developer of the decision
promptly except as provided in subsection F4 of this section.
      4.   The Administrator may refer any lot split application to the PZC for
confirmation of its compliance or lack of compliance with the comprehensive
plan and this title. All such referrals shall be placed on the agenda of the
next regular PZC meeting at which time is available.
      5.   The Administrator's or PZC's decision may be appealed to the BOCC
using the appeals procedure in subsection 10-2-3A of this chapter. Any person
wishing to appeal a decision shall file a notice of appeal with the
Administrator within fourteen (14) days after notice of the decision being
appealed is received. Developers proceed at their own risk during the appeal
period.
      6.   A lot split of less than the minimum acres will be permitted when
the parcel is isolated from the rest of the original parcel due to natural or
public barriers which are beyond the landowner's control to change or remove.
Subdivisions with lots less than one acre must meet all State health and water
regulations.
         a.   These barriers may include:
            (1)   Rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, or cliffs.
            (2)   Publicly maintained roads and highways.
            (3)   Canals and laterals maintained by a canal company or an
irrigation district.
            (4)   Publicly maintained trails, paths, or walkways only when
those trails, paths or walkways are fenced.
            (5)   Similar situations.
         b.   These barriers may not include privately owned or maintained
laterals, ditches, fences, trails, paths, walkways, driveways, or access roads.
      7.   Approval of a lot split permit alone does not constitute or imply
approval of a permit for any prospective use of the lot created.
      8.   The minimum lot size for permitted residences should be one acre,
except in certain approved subdivisions, which may require central water and
sewer systems.
   G.   Subdivision Permits: The subdivision permit procedure is designed to
assure that land development is accompanied by installation of the necessary on
site public facilities and that it is compatible with neighboring land uses,
the landscape setting, and the capacity of offsite public facilities and
services. County review of subdivisions helps protect utility easements and
road rights-of-way from encroachment and protects consumers from purchasing
inaccurately described property. Applications for subdivision permits shall
follow the procedure described herein. In order to reduce the number of
hearings required, an application for a subdivision permit may be submitted and
processed simultaneously with an application for a special use permit for a
special use on one or more of the proposed subdivision lots.
      1.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form,
including a preliminary plat, which for minor subdivisions is also the final
plat, the required supporting materials, and the required application fee with
the Administrator.
      2.   The Administrator shall place a hearing on the application on the
agenda of the next regular PZC meeting for which the notice requirements of
subsection G4 of this section can be met and at which time will allow proper
consideration of the proposed subdivision.
      3.   The Administrator may contract for professional review of the
application, with the cost of that review being covered by the application fee.
Such reviews shall be prepared in the form of a written report submitted to the
Administrator for use at the hearing. The Administrator shall, upon its
receipt, provide a copy of this report to the developer and place it on file
for public review with the other application materials.
      4.   The Administrator shall provide notice of the hearing, as follows:
         a.   By first class mail: To all adjoining property owners and all
owners of property within one thousand feet (1,000') of the site at least
fifteen (15) days before the hearing, except as provided in subsection G4d of
this section;
         b.   By publication: One legal notice in the official newspaper and
posted on County website, appearing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing; and
         c.   By first class mail or fax: To media and interested agencies and
individuals who have requested, in writing, that the Administrator provide such
notice, and to all potentially affected public service providers, specifically
including the potentially affected school districts, highway districts,
irrigation entities, law enforcement agencies, and fire districts.
         d.   Where two hundred (200) or more first class mail notices would be
required, the Administrator may provide notice through a display advertisement
at least four inches (4") by two (2) columns in size in the official newspaper
of the County, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing date.
         e.   All notices shall comply with the requirements of subsection K of
this section.
      5.   The PZC shall conduct a hearing on the proposed subdivision. No
application for a subdivision shall be approved if the developer or a
representative is not present.
      6.   The PZC shall determine whether the proposed subdivision is in
compliance with the comprehensive plan and all requirements of this title. If
it finds that the proposed subdivision complies, it may approve the
application. If it finds that the proposed subdivision is not in compliance, it
may disapprove the application. Conditions may be attached to approval of the
permit, as provided in subsection J of this section. Approval of the permit for
a minor subdivision shall also constitute commission approval of that
subdivision's final plat.
      7.   The Administrator shall notify the developer and parties receiving
mailed notice of the PZC's decision promptly.
      8.   The PZC's decision shall be referred to the BOCC using the appeals
procedure of subsection 10-2-3A of this chapter. Any person wishing to appeal a
decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Administrator within fourteen
(14) days after notice of the decision being appealed is received. Developers
proceed at their own risk during the appeal period.
      9.   The developer may file a final plat with the Administrator at any
time after the subdivision permit is approved. Phased final platting is
permitted by section
10-16-5 of this title. No PZC review shall be required for minor subdivisions.
      10.   The BOCC shall determine whether the final plat is in compliance
with the subdivision permit, the comprehensive plan, and this title. If it
finds that the final plat complies, it shall approve that plat. If it finds
that the final plat is not in compliance, it shall disapprove that plat.
Conditions may be attached to approval of a final plat, as provided in
subsection J of this section.
      11.   The Administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties
of the BOCC decision promptly.
      12.   Approval of a subdivision permit or plat does not constitute or
imply approval of a permit for any prospective use of any lot created.
      13.   Unless an existing subdivision is being re-divided and has been
previously zoned RR Zone, approval of a subdivision permit or plat is
contingent on rezoning results.
   H.   Development Permits: The purpose of the development permit procedure is
to ensure that routine land development and building activity complies with
this title. Applications for development permits shall follow the procedure
described herein.
      1.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form, the
required supporting materials, including a site plan, and the required
application fee with the Administrator. The application for a development
permit may be submitted and processed simultaneously with the application for a
lot split permit or a building permit required by the IBC.
      2.   The Administrator shall determine whether the proposed building or
use is in compliance. If he/she finds that the proposed building or use
complies, the application for a permit shall be approved. If he/she finds that
the proposed building or use does not comply, the application for a permit
shall be disapproved.
      3.   The Administrator shall notify the developer of the decision
promptly, except as provided in subsection H4 of this section.
      4.   The Administrator may refer any development permit application to
the PZC for confirmation of its compliance or lack of compliance with the
comprehensive plan and this title. All such referrals shall be placed on the
agenda of the next regular PZC meeting.
      5.   The Administrator's decision may be appealed to the PZC using the
appeals procedure of subsection 10-2-3A of this chapter. Any person wishing to
appeal a decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Administrator within
fourteen (14) days after notice of the decision being appealed is received.
Developers proceed at their own risk during the appeal period.
   I.   Special Use Permits: The purpose of the special use permit procedure is
to implement the comprehensive plan by requiring intensive public review of
certain developments, and by requiring those developments to comply with
performance standards designed to assure their compatibility with neighboring
uses, the landscape setting, and the capacity of public facilities and
services. Applications for special use permits shall follow the procedure
described herein.
      1.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form, the
required supporting materials, including a site plan, and the required
application fee with the Administrator. Upon review of the application and
supporting materials, the Administrator, in his discretion, should the
application require such, schedule the developer and his supporting materials
for a sketch plan review or other review before a workshop or working session
of the Planning and Zoning Commission, prior to accepting the application form.
At the work session the Planning and Zoning Commission may require additional
information or explanation, prior to the public hearing on the application.
      2.   The Administrator shall place a hearing on the application on the
agenda of the next regular PZC meeting for which the notice requirements of
subsection I4 of this section can be met and at which time will allow proper
consideration of the proposed special use.
      3.   The Administrator may contract for professional review of the
application, with the cost of that review being covered by the application fee.
Such reviews shall be prepared in the form of a written report submitted to the
Administrator for use at the hearing. The Administrator shall, upon its
receipt, provide a copy of this report to the developer and place it on file
for public review with the other application materials.
      4.   The Administrator shall provide notice of the hearing, as follows:
         a.   By First Class Mail: To all adjoining property owners and all
owners of property within one thousand feet (1,000') of the site at least
fifteen (15) days before the hearing, except as provided in subsection I4e of
this section.
         b.   By Publication: One legal notice in the official newspaper and
posting on County website, appearing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing.
         c.   By First Class Mail Or By Fax: To media and interested agencies
and individuals who have requested, in writing, that the Administrator provide
such notice, and to all potentially affected public service providers,
specifically including the potentially affected school districts, highway
districts, irrigation entities, law enforcement agencies and fire districts.
         d.   By Posting On The Site: At least seven (7) days before the
hearing a sign conveying the required notice shall be posted on the site. Such
signs shall be prominently visible from the nearest public road.
         e.   Two Hundred Or More Notices: Where two hundred (200) or more
first class mail notices would be required, the Administrator may provide
notice through a display advertisement at least four inches (4") by two (2)
columns in size in the official newspaper of the County, at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the hearing date.
         f.   Compliance: All notices shall comply with the requirements of
subsection K of this section.
      5.   The PZC shall conduct a hearing on the proposed special use. No
application for a special use permit shall be approved if the developer or a
representative is not present.
      6.   The PZC shall determine whether the proposed special use is in
compliance with the comprehensive plan and all requirements of this title. If
it finds that the proposed special use complies, it may approve the
application. If it finds that the proposed special use does not comply, it may
disapprove the application. Conditions may be attached to approval of the
permit, as provided in subsection J of this section.
      7.   The Administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties
of the PZC's decision promptly.
      8.   The PZC's decision may be appealed to the BOCC using the appeals
procedure of subsection 10-2-3A of this chapter. Any person wishing to appeal a
decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Administrator within fourteen
(14) days after notice of the decision being appealed is mailed. Developers
proceed at their own risk during the appeal period.
   J.   Conditions: Conditions may be imposed on any lot split, development,
subdivision, or special use permit approval, or variance, if:
      1.   The conditions are clearly designed to assure compliance with one or
more specific requirements of this title; and
      2.   A list of all conditions imposed is provided to the developer with
notice of the decision. That list shall specifically identify the provision of
this title the condition is designed to implement.
   K.   Hearing Notices: All required notices shall provide the following
information:
      1.   A legal description of the development site;
      2.   The address of the site, or another general description by which the
public can locate it;
      3.   The present land use at the site;
      4.   The proposed use and, for subdivisions, proposed number of lots and
average proposed lot size;

      6.   The date, time, and place of the hearing;
      7.   A statement of the availability of application materials for public

   L.   Approvals Valid For Two Years: Permits, including variances, shall be
valid for two (2) years from the date of approval, unless extended by a
development agreement, as provided in section
10-16-5 of this title. If a building permit is issued, or if activity
authorized by the special use permit commences prior to the expiration of the
permit, then the terms of the special use permit are incorporated into the
building permit or continue to apply to the activity taken, and the permit
shall continue to be valid without requiring to be renewed. If no activity is
undertaken as authorized by the permit, and no building permit or other
authorization is issued, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize an
extension, upon application, if the application shows justifiable cause for a
reasonable extension.
   M.   Permits Required For Electrical Connection:
      1.   No person may apply for or use electrical service in any newly
placed or built structure without first securing a building permit for the
construction or placement of the structure.

following:
         a.   Any new building to which electrical service has not been

not been previously furnished at the present site of said mobile home or
manufactured home.
      4.   In an instance where the building official determines that a
structure is exempt from the requirements of the International Building Code
and therefore no building permit is required, a zoning permit number shall be
issued. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-2-3: APPEALS AND VARIANCES:
   A.   Appeals: Any person may appeal any decision of the Administrator to the
PZC and any decision of the PZC to the BOCC using the procedure described
herein:
      1.   Any person wishing to appeal a decision shall file a notice of
appeal with the Administrator within fourteen (14) days after notice of the
decision being appealed is mailed. The appellant shall file a properly
completed appeals form, the required supporting materials, and the required
deposit for the appeals fee with the Administrator. The appellant shall agree
to be responsible for the actual costs incurred by the County in completing the
appeal. The deposit shall be in an amount set by the Building Administrator.
After completion of the appeals process, the appellant shall be presented a
final costs bill by the commission and shall pay or be refunded the difference
between the actual costs and the deposit. Actual costs shall include the
following: all costs associated with providing legal notice pursuant to this
title and Idaho law such as publication, posting and mailings; costs associated
with conducting required public hearings including travel expenses incurred by
County Planning and Zoning representatives, County Commissioners and Building
Administrator; legal fees incurred by the County in providing legal advice to
the Board or commission, preparation of findings of fact and conclusions of
law, legal research and attendance at the appeal hearing(s); and any other
expense directly related to preparing for, conducting and deliberating after
the appeal hearing.
      2.   The Administrator shall place a hearing on the appeal on the agenda
of the next regular PZC/BOCC meeting for which the notice requirements can be
met. Notice requirements for an appeal shall be the same as for the permit
application.
      3.   The PZC/BOCC shall conduct a hearing on the appeal following the
procedure established in this subsection A. No appeal shall be heard if the
appellant or a representative and, when the appellant is not the developer, the
developer or a representative is not present.
      4.   The PZC/BOCC shall determine whether the decision being appealed is
in compliance with the comprehensive plan and this title, and affirm, modify,
or overturn that decision accordingly.
      5.   On appeal of a decision from the Planning and Zoning Commission to
the BOCC, the appeal shall be on the record established by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and shall be limited to whether the Planning and Zoning
Commission's findings and conclusions are supported by substantial, competent
evidence and are proper under the law.
      6.   The Administrator shall notify the appellant and interested parties
of the PZC/BOCC decision promptly.
   B.   Variances: Variances are intended to provide relief for landowners who,
due to some unique physical characteristic of their property that is beyond
their control, would have no beneficial use of the property if this title is
strictly enforced. Applications for variances shall follow the procedure
described herein. Whenever the need for a variance is anticipated, the
application for a variance may be combined with a lot split, subdivision,
development, or special use permit. Where an application for a variance is
combined with an application for a lot split or building permit, that permit
shall be approved or disapproved by the PZC along with the variance.
      1.   The developer shall file a properly completed application form,
including a site plan, the required supporting materials, and the required
application fee with the Administrator.
      2.   The Administrator shall place a hearing on the variance on the
agenda of the next regular PZC meeting for which the notice requirements can be
met.
      3.   The PZC shall conduct a hearing on the proposed variance. No
application for a variance shall be approved if the developer or a
representative is not present.
      4.   The PZC shall approve a variance only upon finding that:
         a.   The need for a variance results from physical limitations unique
to the lot on which the variance is requested;
         b.   Failure to approve the variance will result in undue hardship
because no reasonable conforming use of the lot is possible without a variance;
         c.   The alleged hardship has not been created by action of the lot's
owner or occupants;
         d.   Approval of the variance will not create a nuisance or result in
potential harm to adjoining properties or the neighborhood;
         e.   Approval of the variance will not have an adverse effect on the
implementation of the comprehensive plan; and
         f.   The variance is the minimum relief from the requirements of this
title necessary to permit a reasonable conforming use.
         g.   Additional findings may be required for variances in the Airport
Safety or Floodplain Overlay Districts.
      5.   Conditions may be attached to the approval of a variance, as
provided in subsection
10-2-2J of this chapter.
      6.   The Administrator shall notify the developer and interested parties
of the PZC's decision promptly.
      7.   The PZC's decision may be appealed to the BOCC using the appeals
procedure of subsection A of this section. Any person wishing to appeal a
decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Administrator within fourteen
(14) days after notice of the decision being appealed is received. Developers
proceed at their own risk during the appeal period. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

continue any hearing for any reason at any time and may allow new testimony at
the continued hearing. The PZC/BOCC may discuss and vote on any application or
issue at the same meeting at which testimony is taken, or at a later meeting.
      5.   Decision Record: All decisions of the PZC or BOCC shall be reported
in the form of a reasoned decision, as required by Idaho Code section 67-6535.
The completed decision record shall include the application materials, any
report prepared by or on contract for the Administrator, and all materials
submitted by the developer or citizens at the public hearing.
      6.   Decision Deadline: This subsection A6 establishes the "reasonable
time" for deliberation on applications by the PZC required by Idaho Code
section 67-6519. The PZC shall make a decision on any application for a permit
as promptly as it can be accomplished in light of the materials received. If
the Board of County Commissioners believes a recommendation or decision should
be forthcoming from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Board may notify
the commission in writing and thereafter the commission shall render a decision
or recommendation within no more than forty five (45) days, or if no decision

owners of property within one thousand feet (1,000') of the site at least
fifteen (15) days before the hearing, except as provided in subsection D4 of

   A.   Failure To Obtain Permit: Whenever the Administrator becomes aware of
an activity for which a permit is required by this title, but for which a
permit has not been approved, he/she shall notify the occupant (and owner, if
they are not the same) of the site to immediately cease all unpermitted
activity. Notice shall be given by posting on the site and/or first class mail.
If activity does not cease immediately, the Administrator shall ask the County

occupancy shall be issued before any building or use is occupied. A certificate
of completion/occupancy indicates that an onsite inspection has shown that the
building or use complies with this title, including any conditions imposed upon
its approval. Occupancy of a building or use without a certificate of
completion/occupancy shall be a violation of this title. The issuance of a
certificate of completion/occupancy shall not be construed as approval of any
violation of this title that may have been undiscovered during the inspection.
   C.   Temporary Certificate Of Completion/Occupancy: A temporary certificate
of completion/occupancy may be issued to permit temporary use of a building in
cases where weather prevents prompt completion of such required improvements as

thirty (30) days allowed; or:
         a.   File a written request with the Administrator for an extension of
time to attain compliance, with such extensions being limited to a maximum of
sixty (60) days and culminated by an inspection to show that compliance has
been attained; or
         b.   File an appeal of the Administrator's notice, following the
procedure of subsection
10-2-3A of this chapter. All enforcement actions shall be stayed while the
appeal is being heard.
      3.   If any person notified of a violation in accordance with subsection
D1 of this section fails to attain compliance within the time allowed, or is
found to be in violation at an appeals hearing, the Administrator shall ask the
County Attorney to take immediate action to end the violation.
      4.   The County Attorney shall take effective action, civil or criminal,
to promptly end the violation.

application applicable prior to the adoption of the agreement or application
for zoning designation change. All uses of the property which are not
consistent with the subsequent applied zone following termination of the
agreement shall cease. The owner(s) of the property may apply for a conditional
use of the parcel if such use is a conditional use within the subsequent
applied zone. A conditional zoning development agreement shall stipulate that
the costs incurred to rezone the property upon termination of the development
agreement be paid by the owner(s) of the property. (Ord. 2013-02, 4-8-2013)

The purpose of the Airport Safety Overlay District (ASOD) is to provide for the
safety of aircraft pilots and passengers and protect a substantial investment
of public funds by assuring that land development and construction activities
within the ASOD are compatible with the safe continued use of the American
Falls and Pocatello Airports. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-2: HEIGHT LIMITATION ZONES:
This Overlay Zoning District is composed of several height limitation zones,
which include all land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional
surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces appurtenant to the American
Falls and Pocatello Airports. These zones are shown on supplements to the
Official Zoning Map established by section
10-3-3 of this title. An area located in more than one of these zones shall be
considered to be in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
   A.   Approach Zones:
      1.   American Falls Airport: The inner edge of this approach zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty feet
(250') wide. This approach zone expands uniformly outward to a width of one
thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') from the end of the primary surface. Its center line is
the continuation of the center line of the runway.
      2.   Pocatello Airport:
         a.   Runway 16/34: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with
the width of the primary surface and is five hundred feet (500') wide. This
approach zone expands uniformly outward to a width of one thousand five hundred
feet (1,500') at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') from the
end of the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center
line of the runway.
         b.   Runway 03/21: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with
the width of the primary surface and is one thousand feet (1,000') wide. To the
northeast, this approach zone expands uniformly outward to a width of sixteen
thousand feet (16,000') at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand feet
(50,000') from the end of the primary surface. Its center line is the
continuation of the center line of the runway. To the southwest, this approach
zone expands uniformly outward to a width of three thousand five hundred feet
(3,500') at a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet (10,000') from the end
of the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line
of the runway.
   B.   Conical Zones: The conical zone commences at the outer edge of the
horizontal zone and extends outward a horizontal distance of four thousand feet
(4,000').
   C.   Horizontal Zones:
      1.   American Falls Airport: The horizontal zone is established by
swinging arcs of five thousand feet (5,000') from the center of each end of the
primary surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to
those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional
zones.
      2.   Pocatello Airport: The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of ten thousand feet (10,000') from the center of each end of the primary
surface of Runway 03/21 and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines
tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.
   D.   Transitional Zones: The transitional zones are beneath the transitional
surfaces defined in section
10-10-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-3: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as provided in subsection E of this section, or by variance, no
structure or tree shall be allowed to break the plane of the imaginary surfaces
established herein.
   A.   Approach Surfaces:
      1.   American Falls Airport And Pocatello Airport Runway 16/34: This
surface is above the approach zones for these runways and slopes twenty feet
(20') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and same elevation
as the primary surface, then extending along the extended runway center line to
the end of the approach zone.
      2.   Pocatello Airport Runway 03/21: This surface is above the approach
zones for this runway. To the northeast it slopes fifty feet (50') outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and same elevation as the primary
surface, and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand feet (10,000')
along the extended runway center line, then forty feet (40') outward for each
foot upward to the end of the approach zone. To the southwest it slopes thirty
four feet (34') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and same
elevation as the primary surface, then extending along the extended runway
center line to the end of the approach zone.
   B.   Conical Surface: These surfaces slope twenty feet (20') outward for
each foot upward beginning at the edge of the horizontal surface and extending
for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000').
   C.   Horizontal Surface: A horizontal plane one hundred fifty feet (150')
above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which, in plan view,
coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone established in subsection
10-10-2C of this chapter.
   D.   Transitional Surface: These surfaces extend outward at ninety degree
(90°) angles to the runway center line and the runway center line extended at a
slope of seven to one (7:1) from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces
to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces.
   E.   Exception From Height Limitations: Nothing in this chapter shall
prohibit the construction or maintenance of any structure of thirty five feet
(35') or less in height, or the growth of any tree to a height up to thirty
five feet (35') above the surface of the land, except in the approach zones.
(Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-4: USE RESTRICTIONS:
No use shall create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the
eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, create bird strike hazards, or in any way endanger or interfere with
the operation of aircraft. Note that this performance standard applies
throughout the County. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

lights Power County or the City of Pocatello deem necessary to indicate their
presence to the operators of aircraft. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of Power County or the City
of Pocatello.
   B.   The repair and, under specified circumstances, replacement of
nonconforming uses and buildings is permitted by subsection
10-1-4C of this title, but no nonconforming use, building, or tree shall be
permitted to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the
effective date hereof. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-6: PERMITS; ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Permit requirements for development activity are established in chapter 2 of
this title. Within the ASOD, permit requirements shall be expanded to include
the planting of any tree with a growth habit of more than thirty five feet
(35') and the construction of any building or structure that is more than
thirty five feet (35') in height and is exempted from the requirement for a
permit by subsection
10-2-2C of this title. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-7: VARIANCES:
The variance procedure is described in subsection
10-2-3B of this title. Any application for a variance of the height limitations
established for the ASOD shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-10-8: OBSTRUCTION MARKING AND LIGHTING:

or relocated as a result of the proposed development and proof that all State
or Federal permits required for that alteration have been approved.
      5.   The developer shall provide base flood elevation data for all
subdivisions or special permit uses that include fifty (50) or more lots or
dwelling units or one or more acres.
   D.   Duties Of Administrator: The Administrator shall serve as the local
Floodplain Ordinance Administrator and perform the duties listed below:
      1.   Determine that all required State and/or Federal permits have been
obtained before reviewing any application for a permit in the FOD.
      2.   Where base flood elevation data are not provided by FEMA: obtain and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from
State, Federal, or other sources as a basis for the administration of these
performance standards.
      3.   Maintain a record of the actual elevation of the lowest floor of new
or substantially improved buildings, and whether or not the building contains a
basement.
      4.   Maintain a record of the floodproofing certifications required by

Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, the use of over-the-top
or frame ties to ground anchors.
   B.   Construction Materials And Methods:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment that is resistant to flood damage, and
using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      2.   All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed, or elevated, or
located, so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within their
components during flooding.
   C.   Utilities And Solid Waste:
      1.   New and replacement potable water systems shall be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      2.   New and replacement sewage disposal systems shall be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the
system into flood waters.
      3.   Solid waste handling and storage facilities shall not be located in
the FOD.
   D.   Hazardous Substances: Storage and handling of hazardous substances in
the FOD is prohibited.
   E.   Site Planning: Design and construction of all subdivisions and uses for
which a special use permit is required shall minimize flood damage. Utilities
shall be located and designed to minimize flood damage, and the site shall be
graded and drained to guide flood waters around and away from existing and/or
proposed buildings.
   F.   Residential Development: Subsections F1 and F2 of this section apply
only where base flood elevations have been established by FEMA.
      1.   Construction or substantial improvement of any dwelling shall result
in the lowest floor being elevated to or above base flood elevation.
      2.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor are prohibited, except
where designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic forces on exterior walls
by allowing for entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by an engineer or architect, or meet the
following minimum standards:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings, having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding, shall be provided;
         b.   The bottom of such openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade; and
         c.   Such openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
      3.   Where base flood elevation data is not available through the Flood
Insurance Study or from another authoritative source, applications must be
reviewed to assure that the proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding. This determination of reasonableness shall be based on evidence
submitted with the application by the developer, including historical flood
records, including photographs of past flood events and similar documentation.
The minimum elevation above grade in such cases shall be two feet (2').
   G.   Nonresidential Development: Construction or substantial improvement of
any nonresidential building shall result in the lowest floor being elevated to
or above base flood elevation or, together with the attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall:
      1.   Be floodproofed so that below base flood level, the building is
watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      2.   Be designed and constructed to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy;
      3.   Present a certification from an engineer or architect that the
design and methods of construction comply with accepted standards of practice
for meeting the performance standards of this title; and
      4.   Meet the performance standard of subsection F2 of this section for
enclosed spaces below the lowest floor.
      5.   Developers floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified
that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1')
below the floodproofed level.
   H.   Manufactured Homes: Manufactured homes that are placed, replaced, or
substantially improved within the FOD shall be elevated on and securely
anchored to a permanent foundation, so that the lowest floor is at or above
base flood elevation, where a base flood elevation has been established or at
least two feet (2') above grade where no base flood elevation has been
established.
   I.   Floodways: The floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and any adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot (1'). The floodway is a hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris and potential projectiles, and due to the high erosion
potential. Encroachments into the floodway, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development is prohibited, unless an
engineer or architect certifies that the encroachment will not result in any
increase in the flood level during the base flood discharge.
   J.   Maintenance Of Flood Capacity: Continuing maintenance to prevent the
reduction of flood carrying capacity in altered or relocated watercourses shall
be required.
   K.   Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): An area of shallow flooding is an
AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). In these areas, base
flood depth ranges from one foot (1') to three feet (3'), a clearly defined
channel does not exist, the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident.
      1.   Construction and substantial improvement of dwellings in AO Zones
shall result in the lowest floor being elevated above the highest adjacent
grade of the building site to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM
or to at least two feet (2'), where no depth number is specified.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential
buildings in AO Zones shall:
         a.   Be graded and drained to guide flood waters around and away from
existing and/or proposed buildings; and
         b.   Have the lowest floor elevated above the highest adjacent grade
of the building site to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM or,
where no depth number is specified, to at least two feet (2') above the highest
adjacent grade; or
         c.   Together with its attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
floodproofed so that any space below that level is watertight, with
substantially impermeable walls and structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Compliance
shall be certified by an engineer or architect. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-11-5: VARIANCES:
   A.   Additional Finding For Variances: The approval of any variance in the
FOD shall be based on all findings required by subsection 10-2-3B4 of this
title, and the additional finding that approval of the variance will not result
in increased flood levels, a threat to public safety, or extraordinary public
expense.
   B.   Notice Of Variance: Where a variance of the requirements of this
chapter is approved, the Administrator's notice of the decision shall state
that the County is not liable for any flood damages that result from the
variance. Where a variance of the elevation requirements of this chapter is
approved, the Administrator shall also notify the developer that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

restrictive requirements on fences crossing their easements. The minimum lot
size for a permitted residence is a minimum of one acre. In certain approved
subdivisions, lot size may be less than one acre but not to exceed three (3)
residences per acre with central systems.
   B.   Access:
      1.   Access Required: All developments and all lots or parcels within a
development shall have safe direct access to a dedicated public road that meets
the design and construction standards of the Power County Highway District.
Provision of access, including road extensions shall be the responsibility of
the developer.
      2.   Winter Road Maintenance: No development shall necessitate extension
of winter road maintenance, except upon submission of a study prepared by
competent professionals, at the developer's expense, clearly demonstrating that
the tax revenues generated by the proposed development will cover the costs of
extending winter maintenance. All applications in areas where there is no
winter road maintenance shall include a signed and dated acknowledgement
showing that the applicant understands that there is no winter road
maintenance.
      3.   Clear Vision Triangles: Clear vision triangles shall be provided at
all intersections and all points of access to public roads, and maintained as

hundred twenty feet (1,320') from a public road which is maintained on a year
round basis, shall provide a minimum of two (2) points of ingress and egress
from the public road or highway serving the development. "Loop" systems that
return to a single point of access to the public road may be acceptable for
relatively small developments (1,000 or less projected average daily trips).
   C.   Off-Street Parking And Loading: All uses shall provide off- street
parking and loading areas as required by section
10-17-4, appendix D of this title. Snow storage shall not be permitted to
reduce the size of required off-street parking or loading areas. (Ord. 2019-01,
1-14-2019)
10-13-4: PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY:
   A.   Hazardous Substances: Any use that is, or may reasonably be expected to
be, subject to the reporting requirements of the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) shall demonstrate continuing
compliance with State and Federal requirements for the storage and handling of
hazardous substances.
   B.   Nuisances: Potential nuisances and hazards shall be mitigated by
appropriate means. Creation of any of the nuisances listed in subsections B1
through B7 of this section shall be a violation of this title, subject to the
penalties provided in subsection
10-2-6E of this title.
      1.   Noise: No commercial or industrial development shall create
excessive levels of noise adversely affecting other commercial or residential
uses. Excessive noise, as measured at the property line of the affected use, is
any noise that exceeds the standards of table 1 of this subsection:

      2.   Light, Glare, Heat: No commercial or industrial development shall
direct light, glare, or heat beyond its property line or, in the case of
industrial uses, beyond the boundary of an Industrial Zoning District. Welding
equipment and other sources of intense light or glare shall be shielded from
the view of neighboring properties or public ways by enclosure in a building,
location on the property, or construction of a fence or wall.
      3.   Dust, Smoke: No development shall generate dust, smoke, odors, or
other airborne pollutants that travel beyond its property line, or in the case
of industrial uses, beyond the boundary of an Industrial Zoning District,
except as permitted by State and Federal air quality standards.
      4.   Drainage: No development shall channel liquid waste or storm or melt
water runoff so as to adversely affect neighboring properties or public ways.
      5.   Solid Waste Storage:
         a.   Solid waste shall be stored in enclosures or containers and in
such a manner as not to attract rodents or other vermin, be susceptible to
spillage by dogs or cats, generate odors beyond the property line or liquid
runoff; or permit blowing of paper and other lightweight waste.
         b.   No solid waste, including construction or demolition debris shall
be buried or otherwise disposed of, except:
            (1)   At a site permitted by State and Federal law, and approved as
a heavy industrial use in compliance with this title; and
            (2)   Where permitted by State and Federal law, and the IBC, as
rubble fill for a construction site.
      6.   Weed Control: As required by Idaho Code section 22-2407, "It shall
be the duty and responsibility of all persons and nonfederal agencies to
control noxious weeds on land and property they own".
      7.   Livestock On Residential Lots: All areas in which livestock or
domestic animals are confined shall be maintained so as not to create a
nuisance impacting neighboring properties with noise, odors, insects, or dust.
See section
10-13-9 of this chapter for livestock criteria.
   C.   Excavation And Grading: Section 1804.3 of the International Building
Code has been adopted to regulate excavation and grading activities.
   D.   Steep Slopes, Bluffs, And Canyon Rims:
      1.   No development shall be permitted on slopes of thirty percent (30%)
or more, or other slopes identified as unstable, or within three hundred feet
(300') of the top edge of bluffs of seventy five feet (75') or more in height,
except where a geotechnical engineer certifies that such development creates no
significant hazard of slope failure or accelerated soil erosion. Note that the
IBC may require geotechnical reports for certain developments on lesser slopes.
      2.   All structures shall be a minimum of one hundred feet (100') from
the Snake River Canyon rim and other canyon rims which are composed of solid
rock cliffs. Other canyon rims shall be treated as a bluff.
   E.   Reservoir Setbacks; American Falls Reservoir: All structures shall be
at least three hundred feet (300') from the high water mark of American Falls
Reservoir. Exception: Uninhabited structures associated with water-related
outdoor recreation areas and marinas may be permitted within three hundred feet
(300') of the high water mark of American Falls Reservoir. The location and
design of such excepted structures shall be reviewed by the Bureau of
Reclamation with a written report of their findings and requested
recommendations being submitted with the application for review by the County.
   F.   Alluvial Fans: Development on alluvial fans shall be designed to
minimize debris flow and sheet flooding hazards. Alluvial fans shall be
identified on a case-by-case basis, using geologic maps and field
investigations.
   G.   Wildfire Hazards: All developments in or adjacent to forested areas, or
areas of flammable brushy vegetation shall:
      1.   For individual structures, including single-family dwellings:
provide a fire defensible space of at least thirty feet (30') around the home
or structure. A "defensible space" is one in which trees are thinned so that
crowns do not overlap or touch, woody brush is removed or substantially
thinned, and dead fuel is removed. Maintenance of the defensible space is a
requirement for continuing compliance with this title.
      2.   For subdivisions: thin timber and remove dead fuel from the entire
site, and provide appropriate perimeter and, in larger developments, internal
fuelbreaks. A fuelbreak is a strategically located strip of land in which the
timber has been thinned and fuel removed to create an open "park-like"
appearance. Fuelbreaks either include roads or are accessible to firefighting
apparatus. Fuelbreaks are generally at least two hundred feet (200') in width,
with the width increasing on slopes over ten percent (10%).
   H.   Childcare Services: Childcare services shall be provided in compliance
with this title and State law 1 , as well as compliance with performance
standards for home occupations. Refer to section
10-17-2, appendix B of this title. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

line.
      3.   Loss Of Required Yard Space: No space required to make up any
required yard, or to maintain the required maximum lot coverage, shall be
removed from the lot by sale, lease, or other conveyance.
      4.   Exception For Nonconforming Subdivisions: In residential
subdivisions platted prior to the effective date hereof where recorded
covenants dictate front, side, and rear setbacks for single-family dwellings
that are less than those adopted herein, new development shall be approved
where the setbacks provided by the covenants are observed, provided that:
         a.   The subdivision was not vacant on the effective date hereof;
         b.   The dwellings that exist in the subdivision have observed the
setbacks provided by the covenants;
         c.   The front setback along arterial roads will not be reduced; and
         d.   No setback will be insufficient for access by firefighters.
   B.   Land Use Compatibility: The review of special use permit applications
and proposals for Zoning Map amendments shall include a determination that the
proposed development or type of development is compatible with neighboring
uses, with compatibility being evaluated using each of these factors:
      1.   Lot coverage and the extent of landscaping, including the
effectiveness of proposed landscaped buffers;
      2.   Building bulk, height, and scale;
      3.   The effect on scenic views from adjoining properties and public
spaces;
      4.   Activity levels, as measured by traffic and noise generation,
parking requirements, the number and size of signs, hours of operation, and
similar indicators; and
      5.   The extent of functional connections with adjoining developments
(existing and anticipated), including shared access to arterials, shared
parking and service access, shared buffering and open space, and shared
pedestrian circulation.
   C.   Land Use Along Arterial Roads: Where residential development is
proposed along an arterial, reverse frontage, deep lots, and landscaped buffers
installed by the developer shall be used to separate homes and traffic.
Landscaped buffer standards are found in section
10-13-8, table 2 of this chapter.
   D.   Landscaped Buffers: Landscaped buffers shall be provided as required by
section
10-13-8, table 2 of this chapter, and section
10-17-3, appendix C of this title.
      1.   Wherever landscaped buffering is required by this title, a planting
plan shall be required as part of the application for a permit. That plan shall
show the width of the buffer; the number, size, and species of all proposed
plant materials, how the proposed buffer will be graded (i.e., level, berm,
swale); how irrigation will be provided, and, where applicable, the location of
any fences, walls, sign poles or pedestals, or other structures that will be
placed in the buffer.
      2.   Existing vegetation shall be retained to serve required buffering or
screening functions wherever possible.
   E.   Irrigation Systems: All developments including or adjoining irrigated
lands, or including or adjoining any irrigation works (diversions, head gates,
canals, pumps, drains, etc.) shall be reviewed by the responsible irrigation
entity. No development shall be permitted to adversely impact the operation of
any irrigation system. See section
10-14-6 of this title for additional requirements for the subdivision of
irrigated land.
   F.   Temporary Uses: Any use permitted in the A, HI, LI, REC or C Zoning
Districts may also be established as a temporary use in those zoning districts.
      1.   Development Permit: A development permit (see section
10-2-2 of this title) shall be required for a temporary use, but the duration
of the permit shall be for a specified term not exceeding ninety (90) days.
      2.   Access And Parking: No temporary use shall reduce the number of
parking spaces provided by any other use below that required by section
10-17-4, appendix D of this title, or interfere with safe access to a property
or circulation through any parking or loading area. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)
10-13-6: MAINTAINING NATURAL AND CULTURAL ASSETS:
   A.   Stream Corridors: A minimum development setback of fifty feet (50')
from the annual average high water mark shall be required along all streams,
perennial and intermittent. Use of the buffers created by this requirement
shall be compatible with the protection of stream corridor values.
      1.   Stream corridors may be left in, or restored to, native riparian or
wetlands vegetation or planted as lawns. They may not be developed in any way,
except as permitted below.
      2.   Roads and utility lines may cross stream corridors, but the number
and width of such crossings shall be minimized. Roads may be required to cross
a stream on a bridge rather than with a culvert and fill, where the County, in
consultation with the Idaho Fish and Game Department determines that a bridge
crossing is necessary to protect the fishery.
      3.   Irrigation works (dams, head gates, ditches, etc.) may be placed in
stream corridors, as may hydroelectric power generation facilities, upon
issuance of all required State and Federal permits.
      4.   Boat ramps, docks, and piers may be installed within stream
corridors, but shall occupy no more than ten percent (10%) of the stream
frontage on any lot or site, with a minimum disturbance of twenty four feet
(24') permitted on any lot or site. Note that State or Federal permits may be
required for the disturbance of stream channels.
      5.   The development setbacks required here shall be clearly shown on
final site plans and plats. In subdivisions, the setback line shall be located
by a permanent monument on each lot line that runs more or less perpendicular
to the stream and at the center of each lot that borders the stream.
      6.   Note that use of stream corridors may also be affected by the
performance standards of chapter 11 of this title.
   B.   Wetlands: All developments shall demonstrate compliance with State and
Federal wetlands protection requirements.
   C.   Historic And Archeological Sites: Archeological and historical sites
shall remain undeveloped, except where:
      1.   Historic buildings are restored for use, in compliance with the
"Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings"; or
      2.   The PZC finds that preservation of the site will create a severe
hardship on the developer. In such cases, the developer shall be required to
provide documentation of the site's value before it is disturbed.
   D.   Wildlife Habitat: Important wildlife habitat shall remain undeveloped,
except where the PZC finds that its protection will create a severe hardship on
the developer. In such cases, the developer shall be required to implement a
plan for wildlife habitat protection. That plan shall:
      1.   Identify the important wildlife habitat area, the principal species
present, and species used as "indicators" in the habitat protection plan;
      2.   Identify existing wildlife habitat elements, including sources of
water, vegetative cover, and migration routes or other wildlife use areas;
      3.   Show how land disturbance will be minimized in order to maximize
retention of large habitat patches;
      4.   Show how the site plan provides for movement of wildlife through or
around developed areas and the connection of habitat patches;
      5.   Show how disturbed areas will be revegetated with native plants and
how revegetation will result in a volume, structure, and diversity of
vegetation similar to that found in the existing habitat; and
      6.   Show how occupants will be educated in order to promote long- run
maintenance of the habitat protection features of the site plan. (Ord. 2019-01,
1-14-2019)
10-13-7: LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENT:
A large-scale development includes forty (40) or more residential lots or units
or commercial uses that will potentially generate four hundred (400) or more
average daily trips.
   A.   Purpose; Inclusions: Large-scale developments shall provide additional
on- and off-site public facilities necessitated by their development. Such
facilities shall be provided in compliance with all requirements of this title
and may include: off-site runoff and erosion control measures; central sewerage
systems; such off-site road improvements as deceleration or acceleration lanes,
left turn lanes, signs or signals, and bridges or culverts; solid waste
transfer stations; emergency services buildings and apparatus, including fire
engines and ambulances; neighborhood parks (which may include space used for
recreational trails) at a rate of two (2) acres per 1,000 population; and
school buildings, including additions to existing buildings.
   B.   Development Study; Fees; Hearing: The public facilities' needs of any
large-scale development shall be determined through a fact-finding process
conducted by the PZC, at the expense of the developer. The commission may
retain professional planners and/or engineers to conduct this study, the
purpose of which shall be to determine what new facilities' needs may be
attributed to the proposed development. The large-scale development study
process shall be conducted as follows:
      1.   The Administrator shall determine whether a proposed development is
a "large-scale development" as defined by this title;
      2.   The Administrator shall not approve a permit for or schedule a
hearing on an application determined to be for a large-scale development, but
shall, instead, place initiation of a large- scale development study on the
agenda of the next regular commission meeting; at which
      3.   The commission shall review the application. If it confirms the
Administrator's determination, the commission shall require a large-scale
development study.
      4.   Where a large-scale development study is required, the developer
shall place a deposit with the Administrator in the amount required by the
resolution establishing fees for the administration of this title. The
Administrator shall retain appropriate professional assistance for the study,
drawing against the deposit as necessary. Additional actual costs shall be
billed to the developer, with such costs being paid before a hearing on the
application is scheduled. Any unused funds shall be returned to the developer
upon completion of the study.
      5.   An application shall be considered complete and a hearing conducted
only after completion of the large-scale development study.
   C.   Fire Protection: Large-scale developments shall be in, or annexed to, a
fire protection district 1 .
Exception: A mine or similar resource-dependent development may provide its own
fire protection. (Ord. 2019-01, 1-14-2019)

10-16-3: INSTALLATION AT DEVELOPER'S EXPENSE:
The installation of all required improvements shall be at the developer's
expense. The Power County Highway District or other affected service providers
may, at their discretion, participate in the costs of adding capacity to
required improvements in order to provide for anticipated future developments.
(Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-4: STANDARDS FOR REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   All required improvements shall be installed in compliance with the
policies of these regulations and any design and engineering standards
separately adopted by the County or other agencies responsible for providing
service to the development.
   B.   All required improvements shall be installed in accordance with the
"Idaho Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction". (Ord. 98-01, 7-
18-1998)
10-16-5: TIME OF INSTALLATION; DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Installation Before Recording Final Plat: Developers may install all
required improvements before a final plat is recorded or the development is
offered for lease or sale, leased, sold, or occupied.
   B.   Phasing; Development Agreement: Developers may elect to record final
plats of the development in phases and/or offer phases of the development for
lease, sale, or occupancy before all required improvements are installed.
Phasing shall be permitted pursuant to a development agreement that:
      1.   Incorporates a conceptual site plan of the entire development (the
site plan used as a basis for permit approval) and a detailed site plan and
construction drawings of the initial phase/s.
      2.   Identifies all required improvements in the initial phase/s and
establishes their estimated cost.
      3.   Sets a schedule for the completion of the required improvements in
the initial phase/s and an anticipated schedule for future phases.
      4.   Guarantees completion, repair, and one year's maintenance of all
required improvements in the initial phase/s using one of the methods listed in
Section
10-16-7 of this Chapter, and provides a process for the submission of detailed
plans, cost estimates, and the guarantee of improvements in future phases.
      5.   Provides a process by which the County may, if necessary, complete
required improvements using the guarantee/s provided.

transferred, with County approval, to the developer's successors.
      8.   Provides that the development agreement and any vested rights it
confers shall be void if the County is required to "call" a guarantee to
complete required improvements or if the anticipated schedule required by
subsection B3 above, is not met or renegotiated. The developer shall have the
right to renegotiate the anticipated schedule without losing vested rights,
provided that such negotiations are initiated, by the developer, within ninety
(90) days after his or her failure to initiate or complete a phase as
scheduled.
      9.   An "initial" phase is any phase anticipated to begin within eighteen
(18) months. The anticipated schedule may set times for the initiation or
completion of a phase in terms of reasonable ranges of no more than twelve (12)
months. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-6: EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
The effect of a development agreement shall be to create vested rights in the
conceptual site plan, as it was approved. Development agreements do not
insulate developments from changes in State or Federal regulations or changes
in Building and Fire Codes. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-7: GUARANTEES:
Completion of the improvements identified in a development agreement shall be
guaranteed by one of the following methods:
   A.   Escrow: The developer may place an amount equal to one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the estimated cost in escrow, with that amount and
accumulated interest being released only after the County has inspected and
accepted the required improvements. A development agreement may provide for the
phased release of a portion of the escrowed funds as work proceeds, but at
least twenty five percent (25%) of the amount in escrow shall be retained until
all required improvements are installed, inspected, and accepted. If any
required improvements are not completed as provided in the development
agreement, the County shall use as much as necessary of the escrow account to
complete those improvements, before returning any remaining balance to the
developer.
   B.   Letter Of Credit: The developer may provide an irrevocable or standing
letter of credit for an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
estimated cost. The letter of credit shall be released only after the County
has inspected and accepted the required improvements. If any required
improvements are not completed as provided in the development agreement, the
County shall use as much as necessary of the credit available to complete those
improvements.
   C.   Development Agreement: Large development may be completed in phases,
with a separate final plat for each phase, but only where the development
agreement provides for the timely installation of essential improvements, sets
a schedule for each phase, provides for financial assurance by one of the
methods listed above for each phase, and specifies a process for renegotiation
of the agreement if the schedule is not met. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-8: INSPECTION; FEES; ACCEPTANCE:
   A.   Inspection Fees: Fees for the inspection of required improvements shall
be set by resolution. Inspection fees shall be paid before any work on required
improvements is permitted.
   B.   Inspection And Acceptance Of Improvements: Required improvements shall
be inspected by the Administrator before acceptance. Acceptance of required
improvements shall be by action of the BOCC, following submission of the
developer's written request for acceptance and receipt of the Administrator's
report that all improvements have been inspected and are in compliance with
these regulations. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-9: AS-BUILT DRAWINGS:
Reproducible as-built drawings of all subdivision improvements shall be
provided to the County at the developer's expense. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-10: WARRANTY OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Required improvements shall be warranted by the developer for both materials
and workmanship for one year after their acceptance. Such a warranty provision
shall be included in all development agreements. Where all required
improvements will be completed before a final plat is approved and the
development is offered for lease, sale, or occupancy, a warranty agreement
shall be submitted for approval. Enforcement of the warranty shall be assured
by:
   A.   Retention of ten percent (10%) of an escrow account established to
comply with subsection
10-16-7A of this Chapter;
   B.   A continuing letter of credit, as provided in subsection 10-16-7B of
this Chapter, but for ten percent (10%) of the cost of the required
improvements; or
   C.   Establishment of a new escrow account or letter of credit, in which an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the cost of all required improvements is
deposited, and which shall be released only upon expiration of the warranty.
(Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)
10-16-11: MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Continuing Maintenance Required: Continuing maintenance of any private
improvement required for compliance with any performance standard of this Title
shall be required. Maintenance of landscaped areas shall include irrigation,
maintenance of the irrigation system, and weed and pest control.
   B.   Maintenance Mechanism: Any development subject to continuing
maintenance requirements that results, or may reasonably be expected to result,
in the creation of multiple ownerships shall create a community association or
other mechanism to ensure continuing maintenance. The developer shall submit
the proposed declaration of covenants, articles of incorporation, and bylaws
for the community association with his or her application for a permit and
shall provide evidence that these documents have been recorded before a
certificate of compliance is issued.
   C.   Failure To Maintain: Failure to maintain any required improvement shall
be a violation of this Title. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)

   A.   Purpose: Landscaping requirements are an essential element in
mitigating potential land use conflicts and enhancing the visual appeal of the
County. The purpose of this Appendix is to assure that landscaped buffers
required by these regulations accomplish those goals.
   B.   Minimum Buffer Requirements: The width of required buffers shall vary
with the nature of the uses being separated, the height of the buildings being
buffered, and the construction of the buffer. Table 2 in Section
10-13-8 of this Title shows the width required where the buffer consists of a
level or gently sloping area of sod or ground cover and at least four (4) major
trees per one hundred (100) lineal feet of buffer. That Table also shows where
a security fence and/or a solid fence, wall, or berm is required as part of a
buffer.
   C.   Height Adjustment: The basic buffer width shall be increased by the
height adjustment factor, where one is established. The height adjustment
factor is a ratio expressing the number of feet that must be added to the basic
buffer width for each foot in height over twenty five feet (25') of the
building being buffered.
   D.   Buffer Width Reduction; Berms: The basic buffer width requirements of
Table 2 in Section
10-13-8 of this Title may be reduced where a berm is included in the buffer.
The width reduction shall be twice the height of the berm, but the maximum
permitted reduction shall be ten feet (10'). No berm shall have a slope of more
than three to one (3:1), except where a retaining wall is incorporated into the
berm. Such walls may be used only on the side opposite the use or public way
being buffered.
   E.   Buffer Width Reduction; Additional Plantings: The basic width
requirements may be reduced where a greater density and diversity of plantings
is included in the buffer. The buffer width reductions permitted in this
Section are cumulative and may result in a total reduction of up to thirty
percent (30%). The buffer width reductions permitted by subsection D above are
also cumulative with those permitted herein.
      1.   Major Trees: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten
percent (10%) where five (5) or more major trees per one hundred (100) lineal
feet are planted or retained.
      2.   Understory Trees: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten
percent (10%) where five (5) or more understory trees per one hundred (100)
lineal feet are planted or retained.
      3.   Shrubs: The required buffer width shall be reduced by ten percent
(10%) where twenty (20) or more shrubs per one hundred (100) lineal feet are
planted or retained.
   F.   Minimum Buffer Width: No required buffer shall be less than half the
basic buffer width or less than ten feet (10') in width, regardless of any
reductions permitted by subsections D and E above.
   G.   Buffer Crossings; Inclusions: Buffers may be crossed by access
driveways, utility lines, sidewalks, and pedestrian trails. A sidewalk or
pedestrian trail may run along the length of a buffer, with its width, up to a
maximum five feet (5'), being included in the required buffer width. Buffers
may also include permitted signs.

buffers shall be warranted for one year. Plant materials shall meet the
following specifications:
      1.   All trees, major and understory, shall be containerized or bagged
and burlapped stock in good condition with a caliper of at least one and five-
tenths inch (1.5") (measured one foot above grade) for deciduous trees and a
height of at least six feet (6') for coniferous trees; and
      2.   All shrubs shall be minimum one gallon containerized stock in good
condition.
   I.   Maintenance: Perpetual maintenance of required buffers is required by
subsection 10-16-11A of this Title. (Ord. 98-01, 7-18-1998)

should be allowed in land zoned rural residential, commercial, light
industrial, or agricultural. Utility transmission systems should be located in
land zoned heavy industrial wherever possible.
   B.   Unless unreasonable, or absolutely necessary, no systems may be located
on irrigated farmland. The planning and zoning commission should carefully
consider alternatives to locating utility transmission structures on any type
of working agricultural land, including CRP land, due to the potential adverse
impact. Alternatives on public land or land not actively managed or used for
agriculture should be preferred. The location of the utility transmission
systems must be in compliance with the Power County comprehensive plan.
   C.   To the extent that any utility transmission lines go into substations
as control points for any utility transmission system, the site, location or
expansion of any substation within Power County must take into consideration
the impact that expansion or construction, including bringing new transmission
system lines into the substation will have on the related industries and
resources of Power County. Whenever possible, expansion or construction of
substations should not be allowed where they will have an adverse impact upon
currently existing or future heavy industrial uses within Power County.
   D.   Any utility transmission systems sought to be located on working
agricultural land including CRP land farmland or ranch land must be placed
underground unless that would be impossible. An exception to this requirement
must have the approval of the landowner, adjacent landowners, landowners within
one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') of the transmission system and the
Power County planning and zoning commission and the board of county
commissioners. (Ord. 2015-2, 3-9-2015)

This chapter together with amendments thereto, shall be known and may be cited
as the POWER COUNTY PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) ORDINANCE. (Ord. 2010-05, 6-
14-2010)
10-22-2: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
This chapter is adopted pursuant to authority granted by Idaho Code section 67-
6501 et seq., and article 12, section 2 of the Idaho constitution. It is
enacted for the purpose of protecting and promoting the public health, safety
and welfare; to secure the most appropriate use of lands, to encourage
flexibility and creativity in the development of land in order to improve the
design, character, and quality of new development, and to provide usable open
space; to preserve the scenic and aesthetic qualities of lands; to protect
property rights and enhance property values; to ensure that adequate public
facilities and services are provided; to ensure that the local economy is
protected and enhanced; to encourage and promote the development of affordable
housing; to ensure concentration of land; to ensure that the development on
land is commensurate with the physical characteristics of the land; to protect
life and property in areas subject to natural hazards; to protect fish,
wildlife, and recreation resources; to encourage compact rather than scattered
developments; to cause the least possible disruption of farming, ranching, or
other established and ongoing land use activities; to avoid undue water and air
pollution; and, to protect the quality of life offered by the county and
surrounding resources enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. The provisions
for planned unit developments contained herein are intended to encourage the
total planning of developments, encourage energy conservation and use of
renewable resources, and cause the least possible disruption of farming,
ranching, or other established and ongoing land use activities. In order to
provide the flexibility necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter,
specified uses may be permitted subject to the granting of a PUD permit.
Because of their unusual or special characteristics, PUD permits require review
and evaluation so that they may be located properly with respect to the
purposes of this chapter, the comprehensive plan, and all other applicable
ordinances, and with respect to their effects on surrounding properties and the
community at large. In the event of conflict between this chapter and any other
ordinance of the county, this chapter shall control. The review process
prescribed in this chapter is intended to assure compatibility and harmonious
development between uses and surrounding properties and the county at large.

10-22-8: STANDARDS:
   A.   The standards set forth in this section shall apply to review of all
PUD permit applications. The standards shall be used to review and evaluate the
proposal in comparison to the manner of development and effects of permitted
uses and standard development allowed on the property in question. Modification
or waiver from certain standard zoning and subdivision requirements may be
permitted subject to such conditions, limitations and/or additional development
standards as provided herein as the board may prescribe to mitigate adverse
impact at the proposed planned unit development, or to further the land use
policies of the county, or to ensure that the benefits derived from the
development justify a departure from such regulations. Where the board
determines that conditions cannot be devised to achieve the objectives, and/or
the standards contained herein are not met, applications for PUD permits shall
be denied. The board shall make findings that each of the following evaluation
standards has been met. The evaluation standards are as follows:
      1.   Minimum lot size of one acre. All land within the development shall
be contiguous except for intervening waterways and streets. The commission may
recommend waiver or deferral of the minimum lot size and the board may grant
said waiver or deferral only for projects which:

uses shall be no greater than one unit per acre. Notwithstanding the above, the
commission may recommend waiver or deferral of the maximum density and the
board may grant additional density above the aggregate overall allowable
density only for projects which construct employee housing; and which:
         a.   Provide a minimum of ten percent (10%) of "employee housing", as
herein defined; and
         b.   Provide a minimum of twenty five percent (25%) "planned" open
space, as defined herein.
         c.   Provide dedicated infrastructure for police protection, fire
protection and/or medical services;
      6.   That the proposed vehicular and nonmotorized transportation system:
         a.   Is adequate to carry anticipated traffic consistent with existing
and future development of surrounding properties;
         b.   Will not generate vehicular traffic to cause "undue congestion"
of the public street network or trails within or outside the PUD;
         c.   Is designed to provide automotive and pedestrian safety and
convenience;
         d.   Is designed to provide adequate removal, storage and deposition
of snow;
         e.   Is designed so that traffic ingress and egress will have the
least impact possible on adjacent residential uses. This includes design of
roadways and access to connect to arterial streets wherever possible, and
design of ingress, egress and parking areas to have the least impact on
surrounding uses;
         f.   Includes the use of buffers or other physical separations to
buffer vehicular movement from adjacent uses;
         g.   Is designed so that roads are placed so that disturbance of
natural features and existing vegetation is minimized;

shall dedicate to the common use of the homeowners or to the public adequate
open space in a configuration usable and convenient to the residents of the
project. Provision shall be made for adequate and continuing management of all
open spaces and common facilities to ensure proper maintenance thereof
including a dedicated funding source and sufficient guarantees that the land
can be maintained in open space for its intended use (including recreation
facilities if applicable) without becoming a nuisance and without financial
support or maintenance services from the county. If the intended use of the
open space requires water, then there shall be an adequate water right
available to all required or dedicated open space.
         a.   Failure To Maintain Adequately:
            (1)   Deficiencies: In the event that the owner or homeowners'
association shall at any time after establishment of the basic PUD fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance
with the final development plan, the county may serve written notice upon such
individual or organization documenting the reasons for which maintenance has
been judged unsatisfactory, itemizing means by which deficiencies can be
rectified and the deadlines for doing so. Said notice shall also state the date
and place of a hearing concerning this matter.

rectified within thirty (30) days of the final deadline, the county may
maintain the common open space for a period of one year in order to preserve
the taxable values of the properties within the basic PUD.
            (3)   Tax Lien: The cost of such maintenance shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the basic PUD, and shall become a tax
lien on such properties. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the
public any rights to use the common open space beyond those voluntarily
dedicated by the owners.
            (4)   Continued Maintenance: Before the expiration of said year,
the county shall hold a public hearing, after giving notice to the owners, to
determine whether the county shall continue its maintenance role through
private assessment or whether the owner or homeowners' association can resume
its responsibilities as enumerated in the final development plan;

under the authority of the building administrator may include, but are not
limited to, the following: changes to approved colors and/or siding materials,

review process projects determined to be so minor as to not conflict with the

window or door, minor landscape changes. Said exemption must be issued in
writing by the building administrator prior to issuance of a building permit,
and shall be approved by the chair of the planning and zoning commission, or

determine that the proposal cannot be exempted, said proposal shall receive
design review approval prior to issuance of a building permit.
   B.   Authority Of The Commission: The commission is hereby empowered to
approve all other design review application proposals. The commission may elect
to approve applications for design review by consent agenda. Consent agenda
shall be that portion of the commission's agenda where agenda items are not
discussed individually and commission members vote on the package of
applications in its entirety. All application and notice requirements, criteria
and standards established in this design review district or this chapter shall
apply to consent agenda applications. The building administrator shall
determine, in consultation with the commission chair, which applications are to
be placed on the consent agenda. The commission, at their discretion, may
delegate their authority for detailed review of design review criteria and
standards, and other relevant county ordinances, regulations and policies to
the commission chair and the building administrator by placing applications on
the consent agenda. A commissioner, county department head, board member or
affected party may request any application on the consent agenda to be moved to
the regular agenda in order to have a full discussion of potential impacts of
the application. Applications placed on the consent agenda may include, but are
not limited to: deck renovations or extensions, deck enclosures or additions
under two hundred (200) square feet, hot tubs, addition of doors and/or

approved plans and specifications;
   B.   The applicant shall execute a lien as security for the applicant's
performance of the agreement on a form provided by the county;

according to its terms. Upon good cause shown, the building administrator may
extend the period of time within which completion of the improvements is to be
completed;

commission or building administrator shall be completed within sixty (60) days
of occupancy. In the event of partial installation due to seasonable hardship,
the completion date may be adjusted into the following planting season, but
shall not exceed more than twelve (12) months after occupancy without prior
written approval from the building administrator; and
   F.   The applicant shall have the right, after final inspection and issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, to request in writing that the lien be released
by the county upon posting with the county an irrevocable letter of credit, or
other such security as is acceptable to the county at its sole discretion, for
one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the bona fide estimated cost to
complete the required improvements from that time forward. In the event that
the estimated time to construct such required improvement is more than two (2)

fide estimate cost. The building administrator may waive the consensual lien
and completion agreement upon a determination that the site improvements
