AN ORDINANCE ENACTED BY THE CALDWELL CITY COUNCIL, AMENDING CHAPTER 05, ARTICLE
09, SECTION 05-09-01, OF CALDWELL CITY CODE, PERTAINING TO STREET LIGHTS;
PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE; PROVIDING FOR SEVERABILITY; AND REPEALING ALL
ORDINANCES, RESOLUTIONS, ORDERS AND PARTS THEREOF, IN CONFLICT HEREWITH.
BE IT ORDAINED by the Mayor and Council of the City of Caldwell, County of
Canyon, State of Idaho:
Section 1.   That Chapter 5, Article 9, Section 05-09-01 of the Caldwell City
Code is hereby amended to the following:   
 
05-09-01: LEGISLATIVE INTENT:
Article 12, section 2, of the Idaho constitution and section 50-302 of the
Idaho Code authorize cities to make and enforce regulations needed for the
welfare of the city not in conflict with the general laws.
Sections 50-312 and 50-313 of the Idaho Code authorize the city to provide for
street lighting within the city and section s 63-2201A 63-1311 and 63-1311A  of
the Idaho Code authorizes the city to impose and collect fees for such
services.
The city council does hereby find that public lighting promotes the safety and
welfare of property owners and residents of the city and the beneficial use and
enjoyment of improved real property within the city.
The city council further finds that residents and property owners benefit from
public lighting through the increased safety that a well lighted neighborhood
provides and through increased safety when driving or walking in the city and
that these benefits accrue even when such lighting is not adjacent to their
property.
The city council further finds that it is equitable and fair that the owners
and occupants of improved real property pay for public lighting by charges
commensurate with the relative proportionate benefit, as determined by the
council, received for such service.
The city council further finds that the most practical, fair and equitable
method of collecting such charges is to include the billing of such charges as
a separate item under the general utility billings of the city. (Ord. 1945, 5-
4-1992)

of the examiner's duty under this Article. The Hearing Examiner shall have all
powers of the City Council vested upon the City Council for the hearing of

01-05-15: RULES OF EVIDENCE, OFFICIAL NOTICE:
   In contested cases:
   (1)   Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be
excluded. The rules of evidence as applied in nonjury civil cases in the
District Court of this State shall be followed. When necessary to ascertain
facts not reasonably susceptible of proof under those rules, evidence not
admissible thereunder may be admitted, except where precluded by statute, if it
is of a type commonly relied upon by prudent men in the conduct of their
affairs. Agencies shall give effect to the rules of privilege and shall be
noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a hearing will be
expedited and the interests of the parties will not be prejudiced
substantially, any part of the evidence may be received in written form.
   (2)   Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts
if the original is not readily available. Upon request, parties shall be given
an opportunity to compare the copy with the original.
   (3)   A party may conduct cross-examinations required for a full and true
disclosure of the facts.
   (4)   Notice may be taken of judicially cognizable facts. In addition,
notice may be taken of generally recognized technical and scientific facts
within the agency's special knowledge. Parties shall be notified either before
or during the hearing or by reference in preliminary reports or otherwise, of
the material notice, including any staff memoranda or data, and they shall be
afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed. The agency's
experience, technical competence and specialized knowledge may be utilized in
the evaluation of the evidence. (Ord. 1918, 11-4-91)
01-05-17: EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE BY AGENCY:
   When in a contested case, a majority of the officials of the agency who are
to render the final decision have not heard the case or read the record, the
decision, if adverse to a party to the proceeding other than the agency itself,
shall not be made until a proposal for decision is served upon the parties and
an opportunity is afforded to each party adversely affected to file exceptions
and present briefs and oral arguments to the officials who are to render the
decision. The proposal for decision shall contain a statement of the reason
therefor and of each issue of fact or law necessary to the proposed decision,
prepared by the person who conducted the hearing or one who has read the
record. The parties, by written stipulation, may waive compliance with this
Section. (Ord. 1918, 11-4-91)
01-05-19: DECISIONS AND ORDERS:
   A final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in
writing or stated in the record. A final decision shall include findings of
fact and conclusions of law as required by ordinance or State statute and shall
be separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language,
shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying
facts supporting the findings. If, in accordance with agency rules, a party
submitted proposed findings of fact, the decision shall include a ruling upon
each proposed finding. Parties shall be notified either personally or by mail
of any decision or order. Upon request, a copy of the decision or order shall
be delivered or mailed forthwith to each party and to his attorney of record.
(Ord. 1918, 11-4-91)
01-05-21: EX PARTE CONSULTATIONS:
   Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters authorized by law,
members or employees of any agency assigned to render a decision or to make
findings of fact and conclusions of law in a contested case shall not
communicate, directly or indirectly, nor in connection with any issue of fact,
with any person or party, nor in connection with any issue of law, with any
party or his representative, except upon notice and opportunity for all parties
to participate. An agency member may communicate with other members of the
agency and may have the aid and advice of one or more personal assistants.
(Ord. 1918, 11-4-91)
01-05-23: RETENTION OF RECORDS:
   In all contested cases where there has been a hearing, a transcribable,
verbatim record of the proceeding shall be made and shall be kept for a period
of not less than six (6) months after a final decision on the matter. Upon
written request, and within the time period provided above for retention of the
record, any person and/or party may have the record transcribed at his or their
expense. The City Council shall also provide for the keeping of the minutes of
the proceedings. Minutes shall be retained indefinitely, or as provided
otherwise by law. (Ord. 1918, 11-4-91)

ELECTIONS
SECTION:
01-07-01: Election Precincts Established
01-07-02: Electioneering Policies
01-07-01: ELECTION PRECINCTS ESTABLISHED:
   There are hereby established election precincts within the corporate limits
of the city. These precincts shall conform to the election precincts
established by Canyon County. The Canyon County election precincts as they
apply to the corporate limits of the city are hereby adopted and incorporated
by reference. The official precinct boundaries shall be defined and set forth
as determined by the official records of Canyon County which are hereby adopted
and incorporated by reference.
   (1)   Precinct Names: The name of each such election precinct as hereby
established shall conform with the names established for the Canyon County
election precincts.
   (2)   Voting In Designated Precinct: Thereafter, at all municipal elections
and at all special municipal elections, such precincts as hereby created and
established shall be the places wherein all qualified electors living in the
area thereof respectively shall vote at such regular or special municipal
elections provided that such electors are qualified pursuant to Idaho Code.
(Ord. 2188, 3-17-1997)
01-07-02: ELECTIONEERING POLICIES:
   (1)   Electioneering will include the posting, use, or distribution of
political signs, cards, placards, or literature; including flags, and anything
similar that is tangible and designed to call one’s attention to a certain
candidate and/or proposition. The following shall be exempt from
electioneering: wearing of shirts, caps, hats, facial masks, buttons, or
similar gear that reflect a political message. With this preface as a
foundation to understand what ‘electioneering’ is defined as, the City of
Caldwell hereby declares the following as it pertains to permitted but
restricted electioneering conduct near its official polling sites:
      A.   In compliance with Idaho Code Section 18-2318, on the day of any
primary, general or special election, there shall be no electioneering “within
a polling place or any building in which an election is being held, or within
one hundred (100) feet thereof.” The City of Caldwell interprets this provision
to mean that there can be no electioneering on property less than one hundred
feet (100') to the polling sites’ entry door; but the City could establish a
(reasonable) distance to be more than one hundred feet (100'), especially given
the current logistics of perimeter streets, paved parking lots, etc.
   (2)   There shall be no signage, banner, and/or any type of political
expression posted on, in, or over the City of Caldwell right of way, including
any attachments to fencing or landscape in that right of way.
   (3)   There shall be no signage, banner, and/or any other type of political
expression posted on, in, or over any premises as owned by the City of
Caldwell, including, but not limited to: City Hall premises, Library premises,
Police Department premises.
   (4)   There will be no set limit on signage on private property, but the
City strongly encourages a respectful and reasonable limit be evident per
political candidate and/or proposition.
   (5)   To more fully establish a respectful voting experience, as well as
promoting traffic- pedestrian safety between the incoming voting public and
electioneers, the following shall be imposed:
      A.   Electioneering representatives shall not approach moving or non-
moving vehicles as they are in the process of participating in the election
process.
      B.   There shall be no use of loudspeakers, microphones, megaphones,
amplified devices, or any other similar equipment not defined in paragraph A of
this Chapter as ‘electioneering’ on city owned or private property at any time
before, during, or after the voting period. It is deemed that such loud
amplification messaging is distracting enough that may risk traffic accidents.
   (6)   It is expected that all participants in the election process will act
and abide by these reasonable measures in good faith. Should there be a
perceived violation, the City of Caldwell will simply inform the person of the
proper code of electioneering conduct. It is stated that if the violation
persists, then a verbal warning may be issued; then if the violation still
continues, then a written warning may be issued, as well.
   (7)   Penalty: For anyone that blatantly and intentionally continues to
violate the terms of these electioneering policies beyond the escalating steps
just cited, such person(s) may then be subject to a fine not to exceed one-
hundred dollars ($100.00) per occurrence.
   (8)   The electioneering policies shall be enforced in close coordination
with the Caldwell Police Department, or other staff as may be assigned by them.
   (9)   It is declared and ordained that any and all candidates, their
representatives, and any proponent of propositions, shall be provided a copy of
these policies; either through being hand-delivered or through electronic
transmission (as confirmed through this process). Also, the provisions of these
electioneering regulations shall be posted in the City of Caldwell’s official
website at a reasonable tenure prior to the start of the voting period.
   (10)   It is perceived that not all electioneering issues can be documented
since there is a plethora of electioneering variables to factor-in. Therefore,
the City Clerk’s Office shall be delegated the authority to use his/her wisdom
and experience, as well as consult as often as necessary with the City
Attorney’s Office, to resolve all matters or conduct that may challenge the
electioneering policies shown herein. (Ord. 3467, 11-15-2022)

   No employee of the city is authorized to sell, transfer or give away
personal or real property of the city except in accordance with this article
and state law. The unauthorized sale or transfer of property of the city by any
employee, other than by discarding as waste material at the sanitary landfill
or similar approved depository for refuse, shall constitute a misdemeanor,
punishable as provided in Idaho Code sections 50-302(1) and 18-113, as amended,
in addition to any other civil or equitable remedy which might be available to
the city or criminal charge that might be appropriate under the circumstances.
Only the city council has authority to declare property, whether real or
personal, to be surplus. The city clerk shall coordinate the disposal of all
surplus property, including land, buildings, equipment, and other city assets
no longer required for city use, in the manner which is in the best interests
of the city and which is consistent with the requirements of law.
   (1)   Declaration Of Surplus; Disposal Of Personal Property: For an item or
batch of items estimated by the city clerk to be valued at less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and subject to the prohibitions set forth in
subsection (5) of this section, the city clerk shall have full discretion on
when and how such an item, or batch of items, shall be disposed of following
declaration by the city council that such property is surplus, unless specific
dispositive instructions are given by the city council in that declaration.
Surplus personal property estimated by the city clerk to have a value of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or more, shall be disposed of in accordance with
the provisions set forth in subsection (4) of this section. The city council
may, in any resolution declaring personal property to be surplus, direct the
method of disposition. If no method of disposition is set forth in the
resolution, such property shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with
this article and state and federal law.
   (2)   Declaration Of Surplus; Disposal Of Real Property: When appropriate,
the city shall declare city owned real property, including hangars located at
the Caldwell Executive Airport, to be surplus and dispose of such property in
accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in Idaho Code section
50-1403.
   (3)   Transfer Of Surplus Property To Other Government Agencies: When
appropriate and in the city’s best interest, the city clerk shall recommend to
the mayor and city council the transfer or donation of surplus property to
other government agencies in accordance with the requirements of Idaho Code.
   (4)   Disposition Of Surplus Property: The city clerk may dispose of
personal property through a sale, or may, in the alternative, dispose of said
property through exchange for property to be acquired by the city.
      A.   All sales of surplus personal property, except as specifically
provided for herein, shall be made through a public sale or auction and shall
be preceded by some form of public notice, which shall include, at a minimum, a
posting for at least three (3) days on the city’s internet website. Except
where such procedures or requirements are set forth in Idaho Code, decisions
concerning the procedures to be followed for the sale and any additional notice
beyond that required above shall be made by the city clerk.
      B.   If any sale or auction of surplus personal property fails to produce
a buyer at a minimum price set by the city council, if a minimum price was set,
or, if no bids are received, the city clerk shall proceed to dispose of the
property at his or her discretion, subject to the prohibitions set forth in
subsection (5) of this section, in any appropriate manner designed to maximize
the financial return to the city, unless otherwise instructed by the city
council in its resolution declaring such property to be surplus.
      C.   In the event items of surplus personal property are determined to
have no salable value because of condition, obsolescence or inappropriateness
of use for the general public, the city clerk shall dispose of such items in
any manner appropriate, subject to the prohibitions set forth in subsection (5)
of this section.
      D.   When real or personal property is purchased, donated or otherwise
conveyed to the city and federal funding designated for the purpose of
assisting low to moderate income persons with decent, safe, affordable housing
opportunities, has been utilized to obtain or improve the property, it may be
offered for public sale. If the property is not sold through a public sale, the
property may be sold, donated or otherwise conveyed directly to a low to
moderate income person as approved by the city clerk and housing program
administrator. In either event, the sale or conveyance must be consistent with
the requirements of the applicable federal regulations under which the property
was obtained initially or improved.
      E.   All proceeds from the sale or auction of an item or batch of items
of surplus property shall be deposited into the miscellaneous revenue account
of the department from which such item or batch of items originated.
   (5)   Parties Prohibited From Purchasing Surplus Property: It shall be
unlawful for any of the following persons to purchase surplus property at any
sale or auction: mayor, city clerk, members of the city council, appointed
officials or department heads. It shall likewise be unlawful for any
partnership or entity in which any of the foregoing persons have any interest
to purchase such property. No employer, business partner, business associate,
or immediate family member of one of the aforementioned persons shall be
permitted to purchase surplus property at any sale or auction. Finally, no city
employee involved in the sale of any specific item or batch of items of surplus
property shall be permitted to purchase said property. A knowing violation of
this prohibition shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable as provided in
Idaho Code sections 50-302(1) and 18-113, as amended. (Ord. 2887, 11-21-2011;

shops or other marketing methods catering to city employees or members of the
public utilizing city facilities or participation in city sponsored events.

features rather than extensive replacement and new construction. New exterior
additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however, the limited and
sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and other
code required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a

significant elements of the historic property.

restoration project.

were written pursuant to federal law to ensure that work on historic buildings
is done in such a manner which preserves the historical integrity of the
building. For further information refer to the "Secretary Of The Interior's

   SITE (For Purposes Of Designation): Location of a significant event, a
prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure,
whether standing, ruined or vanished, where the location itself possesses

   (1)   Sewer Connection Required And Penalty:
      A.   Every building or structure, including each individual airport
hangar unit even if all airport hangars are contained within the same building,
within the corporate limits of the city shall be separately and independently
connected by a separate building sewer to the POTW where a POTW sewer line is
adjacent to the lot, tract or parcel of land on which the building or structure
stands. Individual service requirements for condominium projects shall be as
per section
11-04-05 of this code. (Ord. 2831, 5-17-2010)
         1.   No more than one building may be connected to a single service
unless approved by the city engineer/public works director which approval shall
be an exception not a rule and only based upon overwhelming evidence that such
a connection is the only practical method by which the buildings can be
connected to the POTW and the ownership of the combined service is clearly
designated and all parties are jointly responsible for the maintenance and
operation of the connection, that appropriate easements exist establishing the
right of all buildings to be connected and to use that connection the allowance
of the connection will not impede the city's ability to collect fees for the
services and does not impede the city's ability to apply all applicable
ordinances and resolutions regarding the providing of the service and the
establishment of the connection and its maintenance. The city engineer/public
works director may also deny an application when the capacity of the city's
POTW might be impaired or there are slope and/or other design issues based upon
reasonable engineering standards and practices regarding such installation as
it pertains to maintenance materials used, diameter of the line, the providing
of cleanouts and the relationship of the buildings to the POTW.
      B.   No permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or
structure in the City on any lot, tract or parcel of land unless the plans and
specifications show connection to the POTW where a POTW sewer line is adjacent

sewer, be connected to the City sewer not later than twelve (12) months from
the time the City sewer is certified and accepted, by the City Engineer/Public
Works Director, as being completed and ready to use. The City Council may,
based upon a justified appeal from the owner of the building or structure,
extend the time for connecting to the City sewer. The following may be
considered justified appeals:
         1.   A claim of financial hardship is presented by the applicant.
Council may allow a time extension to connect of up to twelve (12) months.
         2.   A point of access into the sewer less than twelve feet (12') deep
(as measured from the invert of the main or service line) is not available.
Council may allow a time extension to connect until such time that a point of
access less that twelve feet (12') deep is available.
         3.   A building has a functional site disposal system constructed or
refurbished within the last five (5) years but prior to the time in which sewer
service was available. Council may, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence

establish uniform requirements governing dischargers into the POTW which
enables the City to protect public health in conformity with all applicable
City, State and Federal laws relating thereto which.
      A.   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which would
interfere with the normal operation of the POTW and/or would not receive
adequate treatment or would pass through the system into the receiving waters
or atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      B.   Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the system;
      C.   Ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable law;
      D.   Protect the health of the persons working with the POTW.
   (2)   Applicability:

NATIONAL
PRETREATMENT   Pretreatment standards shall mean prohibited discharge standards, categorical
STANDARDS OR   pretreatment standards, and local limits.
STANDARDS:
               Any building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be a
               discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the publication of
               proposed pretreatment standards under section 307(c) of the Clean Water Act which
               will be applicable to such sources if such standards are thereafter promulgated in
               accordance with that section, provided that:
               A.   The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at a site at
               which no other source is located;
               B.   The building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the process
               or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing
               source; or
               C.   The production of waste water generating processes of the building structure,
               facility or installation are substantially independent of an existing source at the
               same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such
               as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and
               the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity
               as existing source should be considered.
NEW SOURCE:    D.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a
               modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new
               building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of paragraphs (A)
               (2) or (A)(3) but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or
               production equipment.
               E.   Construction of a new source as defined herein has commenced if the owner or
               operator has:
                  1.   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site construction
               program:
                     (A)   Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or
                     (B)   Significant site preparation work including clearing excavation, or
               removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for
               placement, assembly or installation of new source facilities or equipment;
                  2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities
               or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time.
               Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without
               substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do
               not constitute a contractual obligation.
               A "new user" is not a "new-source" and is defined as a user that applies to the City
               for a new building permit or any person who occupies an existing building and plans
NEW USER:      to discharge wastewater to the City's collection system after the effective date of
               this article. Any person that buys an existing facility that is discharging non-
               domestic wastewater will be considered an "existing user" if no significant changes
               are made in the manufacturing operation.

   (3)   Limitations On Wastewater Strength:
      A.   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards: National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards specified in the 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, Parts
405-471 are hereby incorporated as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency pursuant to the Clean Water Act shall be met by all
dischargers of the regulated industrial categories. All categorical
pretreatment standards shall apply at the discharge of the treated categorical
waste stream, "end-of-process." A user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard must also comply with the discharge regulations and pollutant
limitations as set forth in this section except as may be allowed by permit or
special agreement ("Individual Limits") provided such allowance shall not
authorize discharge of any pollutant in excess of said permit, agreement, or
the applicable categorical limits or national pretreatment standards. Special
agreements must be documented as to why the local limit is being lifted.
Special agreements cannot cause the WWTP to exceed its permit limits.
      B.   Local Limits For Specific Pollutants: The following pollutant limits
are established to protect against pass through and interference. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metals unless indicated
otherwise. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit shall apply. The
Director can approve a discharge greater than the local limit, but not above
the categorical limit as long as the agreement does not cause the POTW to
violate its permit limits. Public Works Director.
         (1)   Heavy Metals And Similar Toxic Substances: No person shall
discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum
allowable discharge limits:
Pollutant Maximum Daily Concentration Limit Units
Pollutant       Maximum Daily Concentration Limit Units
Arsenic, Total  0.02                              mg/L
Cadmium, Total  0.5                               mg/L
Chromium, Total 2.8                               mg/L

Zinc, Total     3.5                               mg/L
 
         (2)   Conventional Pollutants: The following discharges of pollutants
released in such strength or volume as to cause interference or pass-through in
the treatment process are not permitted unless approved otherwise in writing by
the Public Works Director either by permit or by special agreement in
accordance with the provisions of this article. The following are maximum daily
limits:
 
Pollutant                              Permit Required Units
5-Day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) 400             mg/L
Total Suspended Solids (TSS)           400             mg/L
Fat, Oil & Grease (FOG)                100             mg/L
 
      C.   Limits Applied At "End-of-Pipe": The above limits apply at the point
where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end-of-pipe).
   (4)   Best Management Practices: The Superintendent may develop and enforce
Best Management Practices (BMP's), by ordinance or in individual wastewater
discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of general
discharge prohibitions and specific discharge prohibitions in subsections (1)
and (2).
   (5)   Flow: No person shall discharge wastewater into the POTW at a flow
rate and/or pollutant discharge rate which is excessive over a relatively short
time period which causes a treatment process upset and subsequent loss of
treatment efficiency.
   (6)   Dilution: No user shall, unless specifically authorized by the Public
Works Director, increase the use of potable or process water in any way, nor
mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
standards set forth in this article.
   (7)   Special Agreement: The City reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with a user setting out special terms under which it may discharge
to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a
categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However,
the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the
categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority. Such a request
will be approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
establishing that categorical pretreatment standard. A user requesting a
fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
   (8)   Pretreatment Facilities: A user shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this Article, and the use and management/
facilities plan shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this article within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, Idaho DEQ, or the Public Works whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the City shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the City
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the POTW under
the provisions of this article.
   (9)   Compliance Deadline: Deadline for compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements by existing users (categorical users)
covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years
of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is
specified in the appropriate standard. The City shall establish a final
compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical
pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for
said user are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards.
New source dischargers and "New Users" that are considered significant
industrial users (SIU) are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge). New sources and "New Users" shall install and
have in operating condition and shall "startup" all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain
a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any existing user or a categorical user which is in
non-compliance with one or more local limits shall be provided with a
compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to ensure
compliance within the shortest time feasible. See subsection
04-07-17(5) for further detain on compliance schedules.
   (10)   Additional Pretreatment Measures: The Public Works Director may:
      A.   Require a user to restrict its discharge during peak flow and/or
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate, consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and/or impose other conditions necessary to protect
the POTW and to determine the user's compliance with said requirements;
      B.   Issue a wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization;
      C.   Require that grease, oil, and sand interceptors be provided when he
or the POTW deems it necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; provided, however that:
         1.   Such interceptors shall not be required for residential user;
         2.   Such interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the Public Works Director and shall be so located to be easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection;
         3.   Such interception units shall be located outside of the public
right-of-way and outside of utility easements;
         4.   Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly in accordance with established BMPs, for their reasonable operational
efficiency by the user at the user's expense;
         5.   The introduction of chemical, bacteria, enzyme or any other
additive into an interceptor, directly or indirectly, that cause interference
with the normal operation of the unit or causes pass through of prohibited
substances is prohibited, unless specifically otherwise authorized by the
Public Works Director, Superintendent, or his or her designee.
         6.   Interceptor maintenance and cleaning records shall be maintained
by the user and made available to pretreatment inspectors for review upon
request.
      D.   Require a user with the potential to discharge flammable substances
to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (11)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans: The Public Works Director
shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The Public Works
Director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement
such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug
discharges. Alternatively, the Public Works Director may develop such a plan
for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      B.   Description of stored chemicals;
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards in subsections (2) and (3) of this section;
      D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      E.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user
shall submit to the Public Works Director a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
      F.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or
accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.
      G.   Significant industrial users are required to notify the POTW
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug
discharge.
   (12)   Septic Tank Wastes:
      A.   Septic tank wastes may be introduced into the POTW only at a
designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such
times as are established by the Public Works Director. Such wastes shall not
violate this section or any other requirements established or adopted by the
City. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facilities shall be issued by the Public Works Director in accordance with
subsection
04-07-15(1)B of this article.
      B.   No load may be discharged without prior consent of the Treatment
Plant Superintendent or his authorized designee. The Superintendent may collect
samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards. The Superintendent may require the hauler to provide a waste
analysis of any load prior to discharge.
      C.   Septage haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load.
This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste
hauler, permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste.
      D.   Under no conditions shall the Superintendent accept trucked or
hauled wastes into the Caldwell sewer system that are classified as hazardous
wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or by Idaho Statutes,
or rules adopted by the Idaho Legislature pursuant to the Idaho Administrative
Procedures Act. (Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)

loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed by
the Public Works Director, for violations of the discharge permit.
   (15)   Reports From Users Not Required To Obtain A Permit: All users not
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the City as the Public Works Director may require.
   (16)   Record Keeping: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this article, including documentation associated with best management
practices and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three (3) years following the expiration of the
permit. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the Public Works Director.
   (17)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on
each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the
pollutants in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______ [specify
applicable National Pretreatment Standard parts(s)], I certify that, to the
best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of
_______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewater due to the activities at the
facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1).
(Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-19: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA. (Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-21: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   (1)   Inspection:
      A.   Right Of Entry: The authority, and/or agents representing the
authority shall be allowed to inspect any facilities, equipment, practices, or
operations which are associated with the industrial user's discharge into the
POTW to ascertain whether the purpose of this article, and any permit or order
issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying
with all requirements thereof. The authority, and/or agents of the authority
shall be allowed to have access to all parts of the premises for the purposes
of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance
of any additional duties. All records must be kept in accordance with the
conditions of the user's discharge permit and be readily available for
inspection.
      B.   Permitted Entry With Proper Identification: Where an industrial user
has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, personnel from the City, State, and EPA will be
permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities. The City will conduct, at a minimum, one inspection at each
SIU annually.
   (2)   Sampling:
      A.   Frequency: The Public Works Director is authorized to require
samples of wastewater discharges from industrial users as often as necessary to
adequately monitor and control their discharge. In the event the Public Works
Director requires such samples, a user shall retain the services of a reputable
commercial laboratory and pay all costs of sample collection and laboratory
services to determine and report the wastewater characteristics.
      B.   Annual Sample; Cost: The control authority shall sample and analyze
the effluent from significant industrial users at least once a year. Samples
may be randomly collected at users' facilities by the authority or its
authorized representative. The cost of such sampling and laboratory analyses
shall be paid by the industrial users.
      C.   Techniques: All handling and preservation of collected samples and
laboratory analyses of samples shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR
part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
EPA determines that part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other persons approved by the EPA.
      D.   Obstructions: Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and
easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the
pretreatment coordinator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the industrial user.
      E.   Unreasonable Delays In Allowing Access; Violation: Unreasonable
delays in allowing City personnel access to the industrial user's premises
shall be a violation of this article.
      F.   Documentation: All samples collected for compliance monitoring by
the industrial user, the City, or their authorized agents shall be fully
documented to demonstrate the integrity of the sample from the time of sample
collection through the chemical analysis and the reporting of the analytical
results. Sample integrity documentation shall be accomplished by use of a field
"Chain-of-Custody" form, approved by the City, and the analytical laboratory's
sample custody system.
      G.   Samples Must Be Typical: All samples must be representative of the
discharge characteristic typically discharged from the facility.
      H.   Grab And Composite Samples:
         1.   Grab samples must be used for pH; cyanide (CN), total phenols,
oil and grease (O&G); fat, oil and grease (FOG); sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds.
         2.   Twenty-four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques for all other pollutants not
listed in subsection (2)H1 of this section, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the
samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user's file for that
facility or facilities.
         3.   Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in
the field; for volatile organics; oil and grease; and fats, oil, and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures may be authorized by the
City, as appropriate.
         4.   For sampling required in support of categorical baseline
monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides,
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the city may authorize a lower minimum number of grab samples.
         5.   For the purposes of sampling and compliance, "daily discharge"
means the discharge of a pollutant measured during a calendar day or any
twenty-four (24) hour period that reasonably represents the calendar day for
purposes of sampling. During parts of the day when there is no discharge of
process wastewater, standing water should not be disproportionately sampled and
analyzed as it would not be representative of the discharge from the facility.
      I.   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated once per year to ensure their accuracy.
   (3)   Sampling Waiver For Pollutants Not Present: The City may waive the
self-monitoring requirements for individual pollutants, including indicator or
surrogate pollutants, for SIUs and CIUs, providing the following criteria are
met:
      A.   The SIU/CIU presents sampling results of one or more samples of the
waste stream prior to pretreatment that confirms the pollutant is not present
at concentrations greater than the facility intake water;
      B.   The sample is confirmed to be representative of the facility
discharge;
      C.   The pollutant is not expected to be present; and
      D.   The waiver is incorporated into the permit.
         1.   The permit must contain the pollutant limits and monitoring
requirements. The waiver is then incorporated into the permit. The data on
which the waiver is issued must be fully documented and retained with the
permit for a period of three (3) years past the expiration of the permit. The
waiver is effective only during the term of the permit. The permit holder may
request another waiver once a new permit has been reissued and an untreated
sample confirms the absence of the pollutant to be waived.
         2.   If the pollutant is subsequently found to be present or is
expected to be present, the industrial user must immediately resume monitoring
and notify the city. Sampling waivers do not apply to CIU baseline monitoring
or ninety (90) day compliance reporting. The City must sample for the pollutant
at least once during the term of the permit.
   (4)   Determination Of Noncompliance: The pretreatment coordinator shall
evaluate all self-monitoring reports, compliance reports, city monitoring
reports and the results of other investigative actions to determine compliance
to the terms and conditions of wastewater discharge permits and this article.
   (5)   Determination Of Significant Noncompliance: The pretreatment
coordinator shall evaluate permitted users for significant noncompliance using
the most recent EPA and/or state methodology for evaluation of significant
noncompliance based on the definition of significant noncompliance as per
subsection
04-07-05(1) of this article.
   (6)   Search Warrants: If the control authority, and/or its agent has been
refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and
is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this article, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine
inspection program of the Public Works Director designed to verify compliance
with this article or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
then the authority, and/or its agent shall seek issuance of a search and/or
seizure warrant from the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. Such
warrant shall be served in compliance with the law.
   (7)   Vandalism: It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW; or monitoring
and surveyance devices placed by the authority for the purpose of monitoring an
industrial user. (Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-23: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from Public Works Director inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Public Works Director, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the IPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction. (Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-25: ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE:
The Public Works Director shall exercise his authority in relation to user
violations and the various enforcement remedies provided by this article in
accordance with the criteria set forth in the enforcement response plan. (Ord.
1997, 9-7-1993, eff. 10-1-1993; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-27: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
In accordance with 40 CFR part 403.8(f)(2)(vii), at least annually, the Public
Works Director will provide public notification, in a newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW, of the industrial users which, at any time during the
previous twelve (12) months, were determined to be in significant noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements.
(Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-29: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   (1)   Notification Of Violation: When the Public Works Director finds that a
user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may serve upon
that user a written notice of violation (via certified letter). Within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Public Works
Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Public Works Director
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (2)   Consent Orders: The Public Works Director may enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents
shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant
to subsections (4) and (5) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
   (3)   Show Cause Hearing: The Public Works Director may order (via a
certified letter) a user which has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Public Works Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (4)   Compliance Orders: When the Public Works Director finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (5)   Cease And Desist Orders:
      A.   When the Public Works Director finds that a user has violated (or
continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Public
Works Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
         1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (6)   Administrative Fines:
      A.   When the Public Works Director determines that a user has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Public Works Director may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, separate fines may be assessed for each day during the period
of violation.
      B.   A user desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Public Works Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within forty-two (42) days of being notified of the fine. Where
a request has merit, the Public Works Director shall convene a hearing on the
matter within thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the user. In the
event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The City may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
      C.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (7)   Emergency Suspensions:
      A.   The Public Works Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge
(after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Public Works Director may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
      B.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Public Works
Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Public Works
Director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (9) of this
section are initiated against the user. The user shall be responsible for the
costs or contracts associated with reversing the measures to sever the sewer
connection if such severance or discontinuance is performed.
      C.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Public Works Director prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (3) and (8) of this
section.
      D.   When the Public Works Director issues an order of immediate
suspension under this section, it shall include a brief reasoned statement,
justifying the order that an immediate danger exists and the reasons for taking
the specific action. The order of suspension shall include findings of fact and
conclusions of law.
      E.   The Public Works Director shall give such notice as is reasonable to
the user who is required to comply with the order and the order is effective
when issued.
      F.   Unless otherwise provided by a provision of law, the Public Works
Director's records need not constitute the exclusive basis for the Public Works
Director's action in emergency suspensions or for judicial review thereof.
   (8)   Authority To Take Emergency Actions: Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this
section so long as there is substantial evidence to support the action of the
Public Works Director in accordance with the provisions of this section and in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
01-05-07(3) of this code.
   (9)   Termination Of Discharge (Nonemergency): In addition to the provisions
in subsection
04-07-15(11) of this article, any user that violates the following conditions
is subject to discharge termination:
      A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in section
04-07-07 of this article.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (3) of this section why
the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the City
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user. (Ord. 1997, 9-7-1993, eff. 10-1-1993; Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord.
3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-31: BOARD OF APPEALS:
   (1)   Any user may petition a decision or determination made by the Public
Works Director relative to the application and/or interpretation of this
article to the board of appeals, which is hereby created and is hereby
appointed as the duly authorized hearing examiner pursuant to section
01-05-13 of this code which board of appeals shall conduct a hearing in
accordance with the terms and provisions of a contested hearing as set forth in
chapter 1, article 5 of this code, and which board shall follow the procedures
specifically prescribed in said article and this section.
   (2)   The board of appeals shall have no authority to waive any requirements
of this article or of applicable state or federal rule or law.
   (3)   The board of appeals shall consist of not more than five (5) and not
less than three (3) persons who shall be appointed by the City and shall hold
office at its pleasure. The board of appeals shall consist of members who are
qualified by experience and training, either technical and/or legal, to pass on
matters coming within their jurisdiction and who are not employees of the City.
The board shall have the authority to adopt rules of procedure for the conduct
of its business which are not otherwise governed by chapter 1, article 5 of
this code.
   (4)   The appeal of any orders, decisions or determinations made by the
Public Works Director shall be considered a contested case as defined in
chapter 1, article 5 of this code and shall be filed within the time period for
which an appeal of said orders, decisions and/or determinations shall be
governed by chapter 1, article 5 of this code, City of Caldwell, unless
otherwise herein provided, but a notice of appeal must include the following:
      A.   Wastewater discharge permit provisions;
      B.   Order, decision or determination objected to;
      C.   Reasons for objection; and
      D.   Any alternate condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater
discharge permit.
   (5)   In the event the Public Works Director has issued an emergency
suspension which has been appealed, the board of appeals shall proceed as
quickly as feasible to complete any proceedings that would be required if the
matter did not involve an emergency.
   (6)   If the City fails to act within sixty (60) days, a request for appeal
shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater
discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify
a wastewater discharge permit, shall be considered final administrative actions
for purposes of judicial review. In the event an appeal is taken for judicial
review and the City has failed to act, the parties to the judicial review shall
be entitled to a de novo hearing.
   (7)   Judicial review of a final decision made under the provisions of this
article shall be governed by the appropriate state and/or federal law
applicable to said decision. (Ord. 1997, 9-7-1993, eff. 10-1-1993; Ord. 3364,
8-16-2021)
04-07-33: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   (1)   Injunctive Relief: When the Public Works Director finds that a user
has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may petition
the district court of the third judicial district in and for the County of
Canyon, State of Idaho, through the City's attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The Public Works
Director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (2)   Civil Penalties:
      A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the City of Caldwell for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period
of violation.
      B.   The Public Works Director may recover reasonable attorney fees,
court costs, and all other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any and all actual
damages incurred by the City (including damages to treatment works, collection
system, fines arising from pass-through interference or any other resulting
harm to the City's treatment works, or public works infrastructure; also
including restorative costs for damages to any public or private property,
injuries or damages to life or limb of any City Employee or private individual
arising from a violation of this article).
      C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
      D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (3)   Criminal Prosecution:
      A.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than
six (6) months, or both.
      B.   A user/domestic user who has willfully or negligently introduced any
substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to fine and/or
imprisonment up to, but not exceeding, the maximum penalties set forth in Idaho
Code section 50-302, as amended. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state
law.
      C.   A user/domestic user who has knowingly made any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who
falsified, tampered with, or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be
punished by fine and/or imprisonment up to, but not exceeding, the maximum
penalties set forth in Idaho Code section 50-302, as amended.
   (4)   Remedies Nonexclusive: The provisions in sections
04-07-29 through
04-07-35 of this article are not exclusive remedies. The authority reserves the
right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the enforcement response plan. However, the authority reserves
the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the authority is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. (Ord.
1997, 9-7-1993, eff. 10-1-1993; Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-35: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
   (1)   Financial Guarantee: The Public Works Director may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
unless such user first files a satisfactory financial guarantee, payable to the
City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Public Works Director to
be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
   (2)   Liability Insurance: The Public Works Director may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (3)   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's
expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (4)   Public Nuisances: A violation of any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Public Works Director. Any
person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of this
code and/or Idaho Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City
for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. (Ord.
1997, 9-7-1993, eff. 10-1-1993; Ord. 2558, 10-17-2005; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-37: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
   (1)   Upset:
      A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (1)C of this section are met.
      C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days):
            (A)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (B)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (C)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
            (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
            (E)   A user will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment standards.
            (F)   A user shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (2)   Bypass:
      A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
 
BYPASS:                 The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
                        portion of a user's treatment facility.
                        Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
                        treatment facilities which causes them to become
                        inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
                        occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
                        damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in
                        production.
 
      B.   Exception: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (2)C and (2)D of this
section.
      C.   Advance Notice:
         1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
         2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time that the
user becomes aware of the bypass to the Superintendent and the Public Works
Director. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Public Works Director may waive the written
report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
      D.   Public Works Director Prohibition/Approval:
         1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Public Works Director may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            (A)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (B)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (C)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (2)C
of this section.
         2.   The Public Works Director may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Public Works Director determines
that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (2)D1 of this
section. (Ord. 2751, 6-16-2008; Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)
04-07-39: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   (1)   Severability: Should any section, clause, paragraph, sentence or
provision of this article be held invalid for any reason, such holding or
decree shall not be construed as affecting the validity of other remaining
portions hereof, it being clear that the City Council would have adopted the
remainder of this article notwithstanding the invalidity of any said section,
clause, paragraph, sentence or provision. All ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.
   (2)   Conflicts: All other articles and parts of other articles inconsistent
or conflicting with any part of this article are hereby repealed to the extent
of the inconsistency or conflict.
   (3)   Interim Period: The period between the date of passage of this article
and the dates hereinafter specified shall be considered the interim period, and
this article shall be administered during said period in accordance with the
following provisions:
      A.   Until the authority (City Council) passes the initial POTW
facilities plan and the Public Works Director issues a permit/special agreement
to any affected user pursuant to that plan:
         1.   Any user discharging into the POTW under an existing user
agreement shall be considered to be operating under a special interim
agreement/permit under this article; provided, however, any provisions therein
which is/are contrary to state or federal law or allow pass-through or
interference are void. The Public Works Director shall give any such affected
user notice of this action;
         2.   Any other user or new user/new source who either indirectly or
directly will discharge or discharges into the POTW any pollutant or any other
substance which requires the issuance of a permit/special agreement under the
provisions and regulations of this article shall apply to the Public Works
Director for an interim permit/special agreement which shall be processed under
the provisions of this article. The Public Works Director, when considering an
application for an interim permit/special agreement, must consider and issue
and/or deny an application for a permit/special agreement subject to the City
IPDES permit, the POTW operational capacity, the existing use and expected use
and demand of that capacity. (Ord. 3364, 8-16-2021)

(Ord. 2828, 6-21-2010; amd. Ord. 3110, 9-18-2017; Ord. 3594, 4-16-2024)
05-07-09: STREET ADDRESS NUMBERING:
   (1)   Numbers To Conform To Grid System: All street and/or common driveway
address numbers shall conform to the City or County grid system, depending on
location as shown on the official address grid system as filed and maintained
by the City Mapping Department. The general standards to be used in developing
and maintaining the street address grid system are as follows:
      A.   City grid system:
         1.   Sixteen (16) grid blocks shall be assigned to each section, as
defined by the public land survey system (PLSS), and approximately three
hundred thirty feet (330') between grid lines shall be standard when
establishing the grid system.
         2.   A standard of approximately twenty-five (25) numbers per grid is
hereby established.
      B.   County grid system:
         1.   Ten (10) grid blocks shall be assigned to each section, as
defined by the PLSS, and approximately five hundred twenty-eight feet (528')
between grid lines.
         2.   There shall be one hundred (100) numbers per grid block.
   (2)   Numbers Assigned By Mapping Department: All address numbers located
within the City limits shall be assigned by the City Mapping Department. No
other person or organization, public or private, shall assign any address
number to any residence, business, industry, or other use.
   (3)   Factors In Assigning Numbers: The following shall be used as a guide
in assigning said address numbers by the City Mapping Department:
      A.   Single-family residential dwellings and duplexes should generally be
assigned individual single address numbers. All other buildings and structures,
including triplexes and other multi-family dwellings, should generally be
assigned only one address number with individual units or spaces within the
building being assigned individual suite or unit numbers in addition to the
single address number assigned to the building as a whole. All primary address
numbers shall be whole numbers. Fractional or decimal part addressing shall not
be allowed.
      B.   Numbers may be assigned to vacant lots within platted residential
subdivisions and should generally be assigned in such a manner that adequate
numbers are reserved for possible future development or resubdivisions of such
land.
      C.   Preferably addresses should generally be assigned on the street upon
which the structure fronts, unless primary access to the building is from
another street or unless the structure is situated such that addressing off the
frontage street would create confusion for emergency services, in which case
addresses should then be assigned on the street which provides primary access.
      D.   All addresses located on the left hand side of streets as the
numbers increase from the numbering grid shall be odd numbers. All addresses on
the right hand side of streets as the numbers increase from the numbering grid
starting point shall be even numbers. These requirements may be varied in the
case of meandering streets. When a street has been determined to be running in
predominantly one direction, the address number shall not be changed if there
is slight change in the street or lane direction. (Ord. 2828, 6-21-2010)
      E.   Whereas there are multiple existing numbering grids in use in the
City, all new addresses shall be assigned using the grid determined by the City
Mapping Department to be the best for the new area.
      F.   Existing address numbers not in conformance with the official
address grid system may be changed by the City Mapping Department, giving
official written notice at least ninety (90) days in advance of the effective
date of such change to property owners and those local agencies affected by
such changes with the exception that the effective date of such change to
vacant properties and properties under new construction shall be immediately
upon notification. Property owners and local agencies noncompliant with
official address changes shall be subject to the administrative citation
process as outlined in section
10-03-10  of this Code.
      G.   When an existing addressed building is demolished, the address
number shall be retired and not re-used for new construction or re-development
unless insufficient address numbers exist to allow such to be changed.
   (4)   Subaddressing:
      A.   The numbering of units, spaces and suites shall take place by the
Mapping Department and, when consultation is needed, said department shall call
upon the Addressing Committee. (Ord. 2828, 6-21-2010; amd. Ord. 3110, 9-18-
2017; Ord. 3594, 4-16-2024)
05-07-10: PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF ADDRESSES ON BUILDINGS AND SIGNS:
All buildings within the City limits, whether occupied or not, and whether for
residential or nonresidential use, shall have address numbers, and, when
required, street names, posted as follows:
   (1)   Address numbers shall be placed on the front of all buildings, whether
residential or nonresidential. If the street address is based upon a street
other than the street upon which the building fronts, the street name should
also be posted on the building in addition to the numbers and the address
numbers and street name should also be posted on the street side of the
building.
   (2)   All approved address numbers, building numbers and approved building
identification (subaddresses) shall be placed in a position plainly legible and
visible from the street fronting the property. All posted numbers shall
contrast distinctly with their background (light on dark or dark on light).
   (3)   Address numbers, and where applicable words, shall be arabic style
numerals or block style alphabet letters.
   (4)   All address numbers shall be a minimum of six inches (6") high with a
minimum stroke width of 0.5 inch. All sizable complexes or facilities (such as
shopping centers, industrial sites, apartment complexes, etc.) shall have
address numbers a minimum of twelve inches (12") high. Any building located
significantly back from the street it faces may be required to post
proportionately larger sized numerals as deemed adequate to identify the
structure. All subaddress numbers shall be a minimum of four inches (4") high.
   (5)   Buildings or uses with permanent on premises monument, post, pole or
freestanding signage that include addressing as part of the signage, shall
place addresses on such signs in large numbers that are distinct and separate
from other messages on the sign.
   (6)   Required address and street name postings on all buildings shall take
place prior to issuance of any temporary or final certificate of occupancy.
Occupied buildings that do not have required address and street name postings
shall be subject to the administrative citation process as outlined in section
10-03-10  of this Code.
   (7)   Temporary street signage and temporary posting of the address number
shall be in place on all construction sites. Construction sites lacking the
required temporary street signage and temporary posting of the address number
shall be subject to the administrative citation process as outlined in section
10-03-10  of this Code. (Ord. 2828, 6-21-2010; amd. Ord. 3110, 9-18-2017; Ord.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4352.png]Publisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new
legislation (Ord. 3702, passed 8-18-2025). The text of the amendment will be
incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.
Article 12, section 2, of the Idaho constitution and section 50-302 of the
Idaho Code authorize cities to make and enforce regulations needed for the
welfare of the city not in conflict with the general laws.
Sections 50-312 and 50-313 of the Idaho Code authorize the city to provide for
street lighting within the city and section 63-2201A of the Idaho Code
authorizes the city to impose and collect fees for such services.
The city council does hereby find that public lighting promotes the safety and
welfare of property owners and residents of the city and the beneficial use and
enjoyment of improved real property within the city.
The city council further finds that residents and property owners benefit from
public lighting through the increased safety that a well lighted neighborhood
provides and through increased safety when driving or walking in the city and
that these benefits accrue even when such lighting is not adjacent to their
property.
The city council further finds that it is equitable and fair that the owners
and occupants of improved real property pay for public lighting by charges
commensurate with the relative proportionate benefit, as determined by the
council, received for such service.
The city council further finds that the most practical, fair and equitable
method of collecting such charges is to include the billing of such charges as

benefit of the general public.
   (3)   The charges assessed shall be included in the general utility billing
as a separate item and as hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that the
costs of lighting to illuminate parks and playfields shall be paid from the

paid from the appropriate department budget.

include real estate which:

residential property shall include property having occupancy or living
accommodations on a permanent or semipermanent basis. (Ord. 1945, 5-4-1992)
   (6)   At the initiation or reconnection of service, the city may elect to
collect a security deposit to ensure the ultimate payment of charges and fees.
The procedures for collecting, the amount, the procedures for applying to
delinquent charges and fees, and the final disposition of unapplied amounts of
said security deposit shall be in accordance with policies adopted by
resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2466, 7-21-2003)

Each section and each provision or requirement of any section of this article
shall be considered severable and the invalidity of any portion of a section or
the invalidity of any portion of the section as to any person or persons shall

08-03-03: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY:
The Caldwell city council finds that the keeping of animals for personal and
commercial purposes is important to the citizens of Caldwell. However, the
presence of animals within the city has certain adverse consequences for the
health, safety and welfare of the public and the animals themselves. Further,
addressing such consequences imposes a regulatory and financial burden upon the
city that should, in fairness, be mitigated by the animal owning public.
Further, the imposition of legal liabilities, fines, fees and regulations upon
the animal owning public serves the purpose of such mitigation. The purpose of
this article is to help solve the problems caused by uncontrolled, unwanted,
undisciplined, and unhealthy animals, as well as animals that are dangerous,
nuisances or subjected to certain acts harmful to the public or the animals
themselves. This article is enacted upon the authority derived from Idaho Code
25-2801 et seq., 50-302, 50-304, 50-319 and 50-334 and to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 2886, 11-21-2011)

made in accordance with Section 108 of the IFC, as follows:
   108.4 Board of Appeals; Procedure for Appeals. The Board of Appeals
established in Section 108.1, above, shall be appointed and act in accordance
with the provisions of this Subsection 108.4. All appeals brought pursuant to
Section 108 of the IFC shall be processed in the manner described herein.
   108.4.1 Terms of Members of the Board of Appeals; Officers. Members of the

      108.4.4.1 Appeals to Appeals Board.  Any person aggrieved by a decision
of the fire code official hereunder may, within ten (10) working days of the
decision, appeal to the Board of Appeals. The appeal shall be initiated by
filing a written petition with the City Clerk, requesting a hearing of the
appeal, setting forth the particular section of the International Fire Code
involved, and shall contain a detailed statement of the grounds and reasons why
the  appellant believes the decision made was an incorrect interpretation of
the International Fire Code, why the provisions of the International Fire Code
did not apply, or that an equivalent method of protection or safety is proposed
and is appropriate. A ten ($10.00) dollar filing fee shall be submitted with
the petition for appeal to cover administrative costs and shall be made payable
to the City and directed to the City Clerk. Failure to file a timely written
petition as required herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal

petition with the City Clerk, and the appropriate filing fee, the City Clerk

appeal. Written notification of the time, place and nature of the hearing shall
be given to the petitioner and the Board members within ten (10) days after the
petition is filed with the City Clerk. Hearing shall be scheduled no later than
thirty (30) days after the date on which the petition was filed and may be
extended for a reasonable period by the chairperson upon written request of the
petitioner or Building Official, for good cause shown. If a petitioner fails to
appear at a scheduled hearing of his or her appeal, the Board may proceed with
the hearing and make a decision in the absence of the petitioner. In the event
a Board of Appeals has not yet been appointed at the time of the filing of the
petition, all of the time periods referenced in this Section 108.4.4.1, above,
shall be tolled until the date upon which the Board of Appeals has been
lawfully appointed. Should a Board of Appeals not be lawfully appointed within
sixty (60) days of the date of filing of a petition, Appellant may choose to
proceed by making a written request to the City Clerk that his appeal be
considered immediately by the City Council, as set forth in Section 108.4.4.3,

serious affairs, and may be based upon such evidence even if it would be
inadmissible in a court of law. The Board of Appeals shall give effect to the
rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to the evidentiary offers may
be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a
hearing will be expedited and the interest of the parties will not be
prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be required to be
submitted in verified written form.

evidence.
         108.4.4.2.6. The chairperson of the Board or his or her designee shall

         108.4.4.3.2 The City Council will conduct a public hearing at the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting, following receipt of the appeal, provided
that a notice period of at least fifteen (15) days be provided to the fire code
official, to the appellant, and to other interested parties, if any, prior to
said hearing. If there is not sufficient time for allowing said notice  then
the public hearing will be held at the first regularly scheduled Council
meeting which will allow for a fifteen (15) day notice of hearing.

10-01-07: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND ZONING ORDINANCE CHANGES UPON ANNEXATION OF
UNINCORPORATED AREA:
Prior to annexation of an unincorporated area, the city council shall receive a
recommendation from the commission on the proposed comprehensive plan map and
zoning ordinance changes for the unincorporated area. The commission and
council shall follow the notice and hearing procedures provided in section 67-
6509, Idaho Code, as well as the notice and hearing procedures provided in
article 3 of this chapter. Annexation ordinances are effective upon the date
noted in the applicable annexation ordinance. The official city comprehensive
plan maps and zoning maps, however, are only officially updated once per year
at the beginning of the calendar year to reflect any amendments from the
previous calendar year. (Ord. 2911, 9-4-2012)
10-01-08: SPLIT ZONING:
   (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide provisions for split zoning
of land, lots, parcels, or tracks.
      A.   Split zoning will not be permissible with any new annexation and/or
rezone requests, except as provided for in
10-01-08 E of this subsection.
      B.   The combining of land, lots, parcels, or tracks shall not result in
more than one (1) primary zoning classification on a single zoning lot.
      C.   Land, lots, parcels, or tracts combined in violation of this
ordinance shall be treated as separate zoning lots corresponding with the
boundaries of the different zoning classifications.
      D.   Where a zoning lot contains two (2) or more existing zoning
classifications, the zoning lot shall be subject to the following:
         1.   Most restrictive provisions shall apply. For existing and
proposed uses and structures, the more restrictive provisions of the primary
zoning districts, including but not limited to, use and building bulk
regulations, lot area, parking and loading, and yard requirements, shall apply
to the entire zoning lot. Rezoning shall be the means used to effectuate a
change to that portion of a lot/parcel zoned differently from the balance of
that lot/parcel where this regulation is deemed undesirable.
         (a)   Exception. Where one (1) zoning district occupies at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the total lot area, the district regulations of
the district occupying the larger portion of the lot shall apply to the entire
zoning lot.
      E.   Split zoning shall be permissible for a subdivision plat so long as
the split zone is separated by legal lot lines. If the final plat is not
recorded and becomes expired and not renewed, the split zoning may revert to
the more stringent single zoning designation. (Ord. 3576, 3-19-2024; amd. Ord.
3661, 4-21-2025)
10-01-09: ALIGNMENT OF ZONING WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS:
   (1)   The Future Land Use Map (FLUM) identifies the vision for a portfolio
of land uses to implement the City’s many diverse goals and objectives and
works in conjunction with the text of the Comprehensive Plan, City Code and
various policies of the City. The FLUM is not a zoning map and differs in that
the FLUM describes the design character, growth strategies, health
intersections, and places types that are desired in the future and not
necessarily the zoning that is currently in place. The Comprehensive Plan
describes various future land uses within the future land use place types, and
contains a map geographically identifying land use patterns. Various types of
zoning and land use may be permitted within each of the place type
designations. Future land use place type designations are not parcel specific.
   (2)   If a parcel on the FLUM indicates more than one place type, the owner
may be required to subdivide the parcel at the time of development to ensure
that the zoning and land use remains consistent with the intent of the FLUM. If
the Director determines the parcel is of such a size that subdividing the
parcel would present development challenges, the Director may waive the
requirement to subdivide the parcel but will determine which single depicted
place type is most appropriate to accomplish the vision of the plan. (Ord.
3576, 3-19-2024; amd. Ord. 3661, 4-21-2025)

industrial uses located within the M-1, M-2, and I-P Zoning Districts, are not
subject to the surfacing requirements listed in subsections (3)G1 and (3)G2 if
fully screened from the public right-of-way and any adjacent properties with a
sight obscuring fence. As an alternative, these facilities may be constructed
with an all-weather surface defined as a minimum of eight inches (8") of
subbase (typically pit run gravel) and a minimum of two inches (2") of base
course material (typically 3/4 inch minus crushed gravel).
         4.   Porous and permeable parking lot surfaces (excluding gravel, road
mix and similar) are permitted in any zoning district with the consent of the
City Engineer and Community Development Director. The applicant shall submit
cross section plans to the City and receive written permission from both
officials prior to construction.
         5.   In all zoning districts, any vehicular use area utilized for
emergency access shall be engineered and constructed to be capable of
supporting a minimum vehicle load of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds.
         6.   The off street parking facility surfaces of agricultural and
related uses located within the RS-1 and RS-2 Zoning Districts, and within the
Caldwell Event Center District Overlay (as outlined in 10-11 of this code) may
be constructed with an all-weather surface defined as a minimum of eight inches
(8") of subbase (typically pit run gravel) and a minimum of two inches (2") of
base course material (typically 3/4 inch minus crushed gravel) at the approval
of the Director and the Engineering Department. Should a development in these
districts choose to pave, the surfacing requirements as listed in subsections
(3)G1 and (3)G2 of this section shall be adhered to. Any other agricultural or
related uses in other districts may be permitted to use an all-weather surface
as approved by the Director through an Alternative Method of Compliance
application.
      H.   Screening And Landscaping: All newly constructed or expanded parking
lots shall comply with the landscaping provisions listed in article 27 of this
chapter. All regular maintenance of parking lots (re-striping or regular
resurfacing) are exempt from complying with the landscaping provisions of this
chapter if previously legal non-conforming. Any existing landscaping/screening
shall be maintained.
      I.   Lighting: All off-street parking areas shall comply with the
lighting standards in Article 4 of this chapter (10-04-10). The Planning and
Zoning Commission may, on petition of neighboring residential property owners
or tenants, and after a public hearing, require that such lighting be reduced
in intensity, height, changed in duration, or turned off after certain hours.
In making this decision on any such petition, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall take into consideration the reasonable requirements of the
user of the parking area involved. The Planning and Zoning Commission’s
decision may be appealed to the City Council through the public hearing appeal
process.
      J.   Required Spaces:
         1.   Residential uses shall be parked at the noted ratios in Table 4
below or as noted within the Specific Use Provisions (10-12) for the applicable
use.
         2.   Unless otherwise specified below or within the Specific Use
Provisions (10-12), all nonresidential uses (excluding industrial/
manufacturing) shall provide one (1) off-street parking space for every five
hundred (500) square feet of gross floor area and shall not exceed one (1)
space for every one hundred and fifty (150) square feet of gross floor area,
unless approved by the Director as outlined in subsection J.5 below.
         3.   Unless otherwise specified below, all industrial/manufacturing
uses shall provide one (1) off street parking space for every two thousand
(2,000) square feet of gross floor area and shall not exceed one (1) space for
every four hundred (400) square feet of gross floor area.
         4.   Uses in a strip mall, business center, commercial or industrial
subdivision or similar may count all parking spaces located within the
development for their use provided business hours do not overlap. For instance,
a space, used as a church on Sundays in a complex filled with professional
offices, may count all of the parking spaces in the complex toward its use on
Sundays if the professional offices are closed on Sundays, thereby eliminating
the need for the church to install an entire parking lot just for the church.
Parking requirements in this section shall not compromise State and Federal
handicap parking regulations. Land uses listed in section
10-02-02 of this article and not listed in table 4 of this section shall be
governed with the parking standards for the general use category (i.e.
nonresidential, industrial, etc.) or shall be determined by the Director.
         5.   The Director has the authority to reduce the minimum or increase
the maximum number of parking stalls required by up to fifty percent (50%).
These shall be decided on a case-by-case basis and shall be dependent on the
ultimate use of the property, existing parking in the area, and other pertinent
factors. Reductions to the minimum parking or bicycle parking requirements or
increases to the maximum parking requirements greater than fifty percent (50%)
may take place through either special use permit approval, a variance approval,
or a planned unit development approval, whichever may be most applicable.

10-02-06-1: PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS AND TERMS:
   (1)   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color,
illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs
placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the
protection of property values and the character of various neighborhoods; to
eliminate signs that create potential hazards to motorists, pedestrians, and
property; to eliminate clutter and preserve and improve the aesthetic values,
economic prosperity, and visual qualities of Caldwell by setting requirements
for the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and
condition of all signs. The city does not intend to have content-based
restrictions or content-based enforcement.
   (2)   Definitions: See section

4-21-2025)
10-02-06-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The following shall apply to signs in all zoning districts:
   (1)   Permits required. No person shall construct, erect, enlarge, alter, or
relocate any sign, or install electrical parts, wiring, or illumination in or
upon a sign regulated by this article, until all required permits have been
obtained, including, but not limited to, sign permits, business license,
building permits, electrical permits, mechanical permits, plumbing permits, and
any other permit required by federal, state, or local law.
   (2)   Special Use Permits. Any situation that involves increasing the square
footage or height of a sign above code allowances, reducing the required
distance a sign is set back from a property line or right of way line,
increasing the maximum number of signs allowed on a property, or allowing
illuminated signs in a zone where illumination is not permitted may be granted
only upon the successful completion of a Special Use Permit and in accordance
with this section.
   (3)   Conformity, permit required. No person shall erect, construct,
enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, convert, equip, use, or maintain any

this chapter. These regulations apply to both commercial and non-commercial
signage.
   (4)   Architectural Compatibility. The number, area, and height of signs as
outlined in this section are intended to be maximum standards which do not
necessarily ensure architectural compatibility. Therefore, in addition to the
enumerated maximum standards, the city shall give consideration to a sign’s
relationship to the overall appearance of the subject property as well as the
surrounding area.
   (5)   Landscaping: All permanent freestanding signs shall be landscaped in
accordance with the requirements listed in the landscaping ordinance.

building architecture and colors. All signs shall be professionally made or
purchased from a retail / wholesale establishment store or sign company.
   (7)   Stricter standards prevail. Nothing in this chapter is intended, nor
shall be construed, to permit the erection, construction, enlargement,
alteration, or maintenance of any sign at any place or in any manner unlawful

Landscaping, shrubs, plants, etc., are not considered fences and do not need to
comply with the provisions contained in this section but must comply with all
provisions contained in article 2 of this chapter. Fence posts, gates, and
other fencing materials installed on a property shall also be in compliance
with the provisions herein, including but not limited to height, setback, and
material.
      B.   No fence shall be constructed or installed in any zoning district
without conforming to these regulations, except those within the C-C City
Center Zoning District which has its own fencing regulations as noted in
Article 10 of this chapter. Additionally, fencing within a designated historic
district must comply with all the fencing regulations as listed in this
section, as well as complying with all fencing regulations as required in
chapter 2, article 17 of this Code (Caldwell Historic Preservation Commission).
      C.   Fences shall be built entirely upon the property they are intended
to serve.
      D.   Fences built across or on easements must allow access to the
entitled parties of the easements for maintenance purposes. Should maintenance
by entitled parties of said easements result in damage or dislocation of
fences, the owner of the property on which said fence is located, at his/her
expense, shall be responsible for any repairs or reconstruction of said fences.
      E.   The property owner shall be responsible for keeping fences
structurally sound so as to not endanger life, property or become a nuisance
and for keeping fences free from advertising (except for that advertising which
is allowed under section
10-02-06 of this article), prohibited signage as per the sign ordinance, and
graffiti.
      F.   Fencing over three feet (3') in height shall not be allowed, placed,
erected, or constructed in any “vision triangle” as defined below.

the edges of two (2) adjacent roadways forty feet (40') along each roadway and
connecting the two (2) points with a straight line. The edge of the roadway
shall be defined as the curb or where the curb would be if no curb is
installed. Driveways are not considered roadways for this definition.
      G.   The International Building Code requires building permits for some
fences and/or walls. See the Building Safety Division for permit requirements.
      H.   Fences are not required anywhere in the City except as may be
required for sight obstruction and/or screening. Certain uses may be declared
by the City to possess characteristics such that sight obstruction and
screening is required to prevent damage, hazard, nuisance, or other detriment
to the public health, safety, or welfare.

            (C)   Shall completely obscure from outside view the use requiring
site obstruction.
      I.   While the City generally prohibits the placement of fencing in
public right-of-way areas along residential zones, fencing that is placed in a
public right-of-way in a residentially zoned area, whether intentionally or
accidentally, is subject to the following conditions whether the fencing is
placed in existing or future public right-of-way areas when in residential
zones:
         1.   Fencing shall be removed by and at the property owner’s expense
within five (5) days of a request by the City to remove said fencing;
         2.   Fencing can be removed by the City after the five (5) day
deadline has expired, without the property owner’s permission and without
compensation to the property owner, and with or without notification, as
necessary for utility or right-of-way maintenance/improvements for any existing
or future public right-of-way area.

resumed, nor shall any other nonconforming use take place.
      E.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure or building
and land use in combination, removal or destruction of the structure or
building shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land and the land
shall thereafter be used in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located. (Ord. 2739, 6-16-2008)
         1.   Except that when destruction of the structure or building and

building shall not thereafter be reestablished, and the use of the premises
thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations of the underlying zone
district.
      B.   Exceptions: Provided, however, that if the property has improvements

as set forth in subsection (4)A of this section is replaced with another
permitted use or approved special use or is vacant for more than three hundred

10-02-09-6: BUFFERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAND USES:
   (1)   Purpose: The requirements of this section are intended to mitigate
potential and anticipated incompatibilities between adjoining but differing
land uses to ensure uses are properly protected and provide for an appropriate
buffer to conduct permitted uses without causing or being subject to adverse
impacts.
   (2)   Applicability: Landscape use buffers may be required for new
development, a change of use, or the expansion/intensification of an existing
use on any parcel sharing a contiguous lot line with a differing zoning
district and/or land use. Differing land uses located on the same parcel may
require a landscape use buffer based upon the type of uses proposed and at the
discretion of the Director. See Article 10-14 for all Multi-Family Residential
buffer requirements when adjacent to other residential uses.
   (3)   Required Buffer Materials:
      A.   Mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees that touch within five (5)
years of planting and where a minimum of 40% of the required trees are
evergreen so that screening and buffering occurs throughout the calendar year.
Tree canopies that will not touch within five (5) years must be supplemented
with additional materials such as tall columnar evergreen shrubs, or other
qualifying screening materials. The submitted landscape plan shall depict
compliance with this requirement.
      B.   Mixture of shrubs, lawn, vegetative, and nonvegetative ground cover
so that the entire buffer width area is covered as follows:
         1.   A minimum of 50% of the required buffer area shall be covered in
shrubs, flowers, and other vegetative groundcover besides turf grass that
includes a ratio of one (1) shrub per three (3) linear feet of buffer area.
         2.   Waterwise landscaping (
10-02-09-10) may be used for industrial districts/uses at the discretion of the
Director when the property does not abut a residential use of any type.
      C.   In addition to landscaping, a solid wall and/or fence may be
required where existing or proposed land uses cannot be adequately screened
with plant materials alone. Chainlink fencing with or without slats does not
qualify as screening material except in the M-2, and I-P zoning districts when
adjacent to a nonresidential use and slats are included in the chainlink fence.
Chainlink fencing may be allowed in the A-D zone consistent with FAA
regulations.
      D.   The installation of landscape and screen material shall not prohibit
or impair a pedestrian’s access to an abutting development where existing
pedestrian facilities exist or are planned.
   (4)   Minimum Buffer Widths Between Land Uses:
      A.   Residential Districts/Uses:
         1.   Regardless of zoning district, residential uses are not required
to provide a landscape use buffer unless specified elsewhere in Chapter 10 of
Caldwell City Code. Except, a minimum fifteen-foot (15') buffer is required to
be located in the residential development if an adjacent nonresidential
development/use (excluding non-annexed agricultural properties) was established
prior to these regulations and does not have a land use buffer. If the adjacent
nonresidential use includes any perimeter landscaping, only the remaining width
is required to satisfy this buffer requirement. Landscaping shall include
vegetative and nonvegetative groundcover consistent with the landscaping
requirements outlined in subsection (3) above.
         2.   Multi-family development buffer requirements are set forth in 10-
14.
      B.   Commercial Uses:
         1.   A minimum twenty-foot (20') buffer is required adjacent to any
residential use;
         2.   No use buffer is required adjacent to other commercial uses.
      C.   Industrial Uses:
         1.   A minimum thirty-foot (30') buffer is required adjacent to any
residential use;
         2.   A minimum twenty-foot (20') buffer is required adjacent to any
nonindustrial use (a nonresidential use that is not an industrial use);
         3.   No use buffer is required adjacent to other industrial uses.
      D.   Special Purpose Districts (A-D, C-D, H-D, P-D):
         1.   A minimum ten-foot (10') buffer is required for a nonresidential/
institutional use adjacent to any residential use;
         2.   No buffer is required between residential uses nor between
institutional or nonresidential uses.
      E.   Projects located in Urban Core Districts (T-N, D-CC, and D-CB):
         1.   No buffer is required within the D-CC, and D-CB.
         2.   Buffer widths in the T-N district shall be based upon the
proposed use. Therefore, if a commercial use is proposed, the buffer
requirements of subsection (4)B shall apply, if an industrial use is proposed,
the buffer requirements of subsection (4)C shall apply, etc.;
         3.   Residential uses in the T-N districts are not required to provide
a land use buffer. However, within a mixed-use project, the Applicant may split
a required buffer across an area between residential and nonresidential land
uses so long as all other required buffer widths are also accommodated for.
   (5)   Notes Regarding Buffer Widths:
      A.   If a street separates differing land uses, the public street and any
required street buffers shall act as the required land use buffer.
      B.   If the adjacent landowner has provided a portion of the required
buffer width and landscaping requirements, the Applicant only needs to provide
the remaining width and requirements (if any) to satisfy the buffer
requirement.
      C.   If an irrigation/drainage easement or irrigation/drainage right of
way exists between the differing uses, the controller only needs to provide the
remaining width and landscaping requirements (if any) to satisfy this buffer
requirement. All required landscape buffer improvements (i.e. required trees
and shrubs) would need to be placed outside of any irrigation/drainage easement
or right-of-way.
      D.   The buffer area shall be placed in a common lot if the project is
within a platted subdivision and within any residential zone, or shall be
located within a recorded, permanent landscaping easement if not platted or if
located within any other zone besides a residential zone. The buffer area shall
be operated and maintained by the controller, a homeowners’ association, or
business owners’ association in accordance with
10-02-09-11(1) A.
      E.   Buffer width reductions may be granted at the discretion of the
Director based upon existing conditions, lot size, right of way requirements,
topography, and geography of the site. Buffer width reductions shall not be
granted based upon financial or economic reasons and shall not be reduced to a
width that impedes healthy tree growth. (Ord. 3662, 4-21-2025)

with existing, proposed, planned or possible future pathways in adjoining
developments, regardless of the zoning district. The community pathway
requirement may be waived if there is no possibility of adjacent connectivity
in the form of an existing, proposed, planned or possible future pathway or
sidewalk. A community pathway is not required in commercial or industrial
subdivisions and/or developments unless there is clear potential for connection
to an existing or future pathway segment.
      E.   A minimum five foot (5') wide landscape buffer shall be provided
along both sides of any community pathway. The pathway, then, shall be a total

Every Controller, as defined in section
10-01-10 of this article, shall be responsible for the following:
   (1)   Requirements and Permits: Meeting all of the requirements and
obtaining all the permits necessary for work done on or adjacent to the public
right of way as described in this article.
   (2)   Care And Maintenance: Care and maintenance of public trees and shrubs
located in the public right of way adjacent to the Controller’s private real
property, including the following activities or actions:
      A.   Removal and replacement of public trees or removal of those portions
of public trees, including tree stumps, declared to be a public nuisance or
requested to be removed by the city or affected utilities located within the
public right of way. Such action shall be coordinated with the City Forester.
      B.   As part of the city’s tree permitting process, whenever a public
tree or shrub is removed, the controller shall replace it, if deemed necessary
by the City Forester, within two (2) weeks of the removal date, with a tree
from the approved list as shown in section
10-08-18 and further approval from the city forester. Selection of species
shall be from the Tree Selection Guide. The replacement tree shall be a minimum
one and one-half inches to three inches (1 ½ - 3") minimum #1 quality tree as
verified by the City Forester. A fine of four hundred dollars ($400.00) per
tree to be replaced may be assessed if said trees are not planted within the
required two (2) week time period, unless the replacement period has been
extended for good cause shown (example of good cause shown: the ground is
frozen solid).
      C.   When a public tree is removed after approval by the City Forester, a
fee in lieu of planting shall be required if the tree is not replaced. The City
Forester shall determine if the tree must be replaced or if a fee in lieu of
planting may be paid. The fee shall be set by the resolution of the City
Council and monies collected shall be placed in a tree replacement fund to be
used for maintenance or acquisition of public trees.
      D.   Pruning of public trees and shrubs and portions of private trees and
shrubs that encroach upon right of way or right of way area. The branches of
public and private trees and shrubs that overhang sidewalks and/or unimproved
right of way must be pruned to provide ten feet (10') of vertical clearance.
Tree branches of either public or private trees that overhang the street must
be pruned to provide fourteen feet (14') of vertical clearance. All pruning
shall be done in accordance with ANSI A300 standards.
   Should either a public or private tree or shrub be out of compliance with
either the ten foot (10') sidewalk vertical clearance or the fourteen foot
(14') street vertical clearance such that a safety hazard is presented or any
type of utility or street maintenance is impeded, city personnel have the
authority to prune said noncompliant tree or shrub, without permission from the
property owner, provided all pruning takes place on or within public right of
way or right of way area and provided that the portions being trimmed are
hanging over or within public right of way or right of way area. Utility
providers shall trim or cut trees in public rights of way according to ANSI
A300 part 1, pruning standards.
   Shrubs in the right-of-way must be pruned below three feet (3') due to
vision obstruction occurring when the public, (wheelchair included), animals,
and children are using the sidewalk adjacent to the right of way. The sight
vision triangle setback for trees or shrubs at intersections must be adhered to
for the same reason.
      E.   Control of pests injurious to public right of way trees and shrubs
adjacent to controller’s real property.
      F.   Control of pest infestations on private trees and shrubs located on
the controller’s private real property.

      A.   Clearing: The controller is responsible for removing all trees,
shrubs and vegetative work derived debris relating to private trees, shrubs and
vegetation from the street, sidewalk and parkway by sunset on the day on which
the work is done unless street closure is authorized. This requirement includes
immediate removal of any private fallen trees or tree limbs from private trees
that fall into any public right of way area. Failure to immediately remove
private fallen trees or tree limbs from private trees that have fallen into any
public right of way area shall constitute a nuisance and may be abated as such
by the city in any manner provided by law.
      B.   Standards: Care and maintenance of public trees and shrubs shall be
governed in part by the city’s arboricultural specifications and ANSI A300
standards.
      C.   Leaf and Debris Removal: Tree debris and leaves from public trees
that fall in the public streets shall be the city’s responsibility to remove.
Tree debris and leaves from either private or public trees that fall onto
property located between a property line and the street edge or curb, as well
as leaves raked into the street shall be the adjoining controller’s
responsibility to remove.
      D.   Removal of Public Trees and Shrubs: It is the policy of the city
that public trees and shrubs shall not be removed without written authorization
of the city forester and the planning and zoning department.
      E.   Basis for Tree and Shrub Removal: Permits will be granted for tree
and shrub removal based on any of the following criteria:
         1.   The tree or shrub is diseased or is an alternate host of a
significant disease.
         2.   The tree or shrub is harboring injurious insects or pathogens and
may present a danger to the city’s community forest.
         3.   The tree or shrub is dying or near dead and/or poses a public
safety hazard.
         4.   The tree or shrub interferes with overhead utility lines and
creates a public safety hazard. In this instance the utility provider’s
standards will be relied upon for assessment purposes.
         5.   The tree or shrub causes sight obstruction in the vision triangle
that cannot be resolved (see section
10-07-07).
         6.   Any other removal criteria deemed appropriate by the city
forester. Note: There is no charge for tree and shrub removal permits.
      A.   Removal of Trees or Shrubs on Private Property Impacting Public
Property: A person engaging in the removal of any tree, shrub or portion
thereof that may fall or fall on or in the public right of way must first
obtain a permit from the City Forester and must call Digline at (208) 342-1585
before removal. If it is apparent that the removal of a tree or shrub from
private land may fall and cause injury to person or public property, the
property owner or their agent must give the city police and fire department
twenty-four (24) hours’ notice prior to removal unless there is an imminent
danger imposed by its continued presence.
      B.   Tree Removal and Trimming Permit Required: Prior to engaging in the
removal or replacement of trees or shrubs, to include trimming, cutting and
pruning in the public rights of way, the controller must first obtain a tree
removal permit from the City Forester, and must call Digline at (208) 342-1585
before removal or planting. The City Forester or other staff representative
will inspect the work for compliance; all removal costs shall be at the
applicant’s expense. A fine of four hundred dollars ($400.00) shall be assessed
to the controller/applicant and a fine of four hundred dollars ($400.00) shall
be assessed to the company that performed the removal and/or trimming if a
permit was not first obtained from the City Forester prior to removal and/or
trimming and if the company was not on the city’s approved list of companies
allowed to trim and/or remove trees and/or shrubs.
      C.   Any person authorized to remove live or dead trees, shrubs or other
vegetation from the city parks or along the streets and alleys of the city or
within public right of way shall do so in such a way that no tree stump or main
root system remains above ground but to a depth of eight inches (8") below the
ground surface. After excavation or grinding, the ground shall be restored to a
smooth and level surface. Any required grinding of a stump shall be completed
within two (2) weeks of tree removal.
      D.   Replacing Trees and Shrubs; Selection Criteria: Selection and
location of required replacement trees and shrubs shall be based on the city’s
arboricultural standards and specifications guide. It shall also be based upon
other applicable city standards regarding the placement of said trees and
shrubs. Refer to the Tree Selection Guide for tree selection.
      E.   Provide water sufficient to keep trees and shrubs located on public
right of way in a healthy, growing condition.
   (4)   Damage To Sidewalk and Surrounding Area by The Roots of Private or
Public Trees or Shrubs: All trees or shrubs growing close to the sidewalk have
the potential to raise or cause a disconnection in the sidewalk. Should the
sidewalk or curb raise, or disconnection occur, consideration will be given to
modifying the sidewalk’s placement to accommodate tree or shrubbery growth on a
case by case basis. The decision to modify the sidewalk shall be made in
consultation with the city engineer and city forester.
   The failure of the controller to respond to a request to remove said trees
and shrubs and repair said sidewalk shall result in abatement as outlined in
this article and/or assessment of an additional four hundred dollar ($400.00)
fine over and above any fines assessed through the abatement process. (Ord.

edition of The Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the International
Society of Arboriculture or the same as amended from time to time.
   If no suitable location exists in the vicinity of the tree removed or if the
replacement tree(s) is of lesser value, the person causing the tree to be
removed shall make a compensatory payment to the City of Caldwell equal to the
difference in value between the tree removed and any replacement tree(s).
   Any public tree that is determined by the City Forester to be damaged, but
not sufficiently to justify its removal, shall be considered to be devalued.
The amount of devaluation shall be paid to the city by the person causing the
damage. Compensatory payments shall be paid into a fund established for that
purpose and restricted to use for the community forestry programs. Nothing in

provided for trees retained in rights of way nor may any tree located there be
removed as part of a development pursuit without prior city approval. Trees
prohibited by this article may remain as part of a development/redevelopment
process without credit. Primary consideration for what species of trees to
remain would be; are they listed as suitable for growing indicated in the Tree
Selection Guide.
   (2)   Tree Preservation Credit: The planning and zoning department, in
cooperation with the City Forester, may allow the development’s required number
of parking spaces to be reduced by up to fifteen percent (15%) to accommodate
the preservation of existing trees with a caliper of four inches (4") or
greater. Parking space reduction credit must correlate to the number of trees
salvaged by that process. Parking space requirements are quantified according
to the type of land use listed in the Caldwell zoning ordinance. A request for
parking space reduction must be made in writing to planning and zoning at the
time of parking/landscaping plan submittal.
   (3)   Tree Replacement Process (Mitigation): Any tree four inches (4") or
greater in caliper that is removed during development shall be replaced with a
one and one-half inch (1 ½ “) to three-inch (3") caliper tree, rated as a #1
quality tree and as verified by the City Forester. Selection of what species to
replace will come from the Tree Selection Guide. If there is not enough room on
the subject site to replace the caliper inch of trees that were removed, the
developer will contribute a dollar amount equal to the corresponding caliper
inch of trees to a Tree Bank for future tree planting. The city may choose
which park, cemetery, or site is most in need of trees.
   (4)   Exceptions:
      A.   If the tree is removed because it poses a health or safety hazard,
the tree will not need to be replaced, provided the City Forester determines a
replacement tree installed at the same location poses a similar risk.

or right of way tree. Fruit and nut bearing trees are not suitable as a street
or right of way tree due to the fruit dropping, staining sidewalks and
pedestrian safety from slipping on the fruit or nuts.
   (5)   Placement Under Power Lines: Class I trees generally grow to a maximum
height of 25-30' with a 15-30' width and are the best tree to use under power
lines. Check with the proper city department to determine where underground
utilities are located. Refer to section
10-08-20 for a list of trees not to be planted in the parkway or right-of-way.
   (6)   This is by no means a complete list of trees that could be planted in
the public right of way. The City Forester will review requests for the
placement of any other species upon request. (Ord. 3662, 4-21-2025)
10-02-10-18: SHRUBS:
Proposed shrubbery species will be evaluated for growth potential. Most shrubs
available from landscape nurseries will be acceptable for planting purposes, if
they grow to a maximum height of three (3'). Shrubs in the right of way must be
pruned to a maximum height of three feet (3') due to vision obstruction
occurring when the public (wheelchair included), animals, children, etc. use
the sidewalk. The sight vision triangle must be adhered to at intersections for
the same reasons. (Ord. 3662, 4-21-2025)
10-02-10-19: NOT TO BE PLANTED IN RIGHT OF WAY:
Please see the Tree Selection Guide at tvcanopy.net/tree-selection-guide for
the list of trees not suitable for planting in any public right of way in the
City of Caldwell. Certain trees exhibit characteristics including but not
limited to extreme insect or disease susceptibility, soft or brittle wood and/
or limited cold and heat hardiness. Such problems often lead to excessive
maintenance costs, hazards to other trees and potential public safety hazards.
Class I and Class III trees are not allowed in the City of Caldwell right of
way unless planter width is ten feet (10') or wider. Conifers and shrub
plantings over three feet (3') are not allowed in the City of Caldwell right of
way. (Ord. 3662, 4-21-2025)
10-02-10-20: DUTCH ELM DISEASE:
   (1)   When Dutch Elm Disease is found to exist in or on trees on public
property or in public right of way, the trees shall be removed as provided in
subsection (2) of this section.
   (2)   When Dutch Elm Disease is found to exist in or on trees on privately
owned property, after notice has been served upon the owner of the premises, it
shall thereupon become the duty of the owner, or his agent, or occupant or
person having custody and control of the property to cause such tree to be
removed and destroyed under the direction and supervision of the City Forester.
In lieu thereof, it shall be abated through the abatement process as outlined
in section
10-08-10 of this code.
   (3)   Whenever an elm tree is found to be infected with Dutch Elm Disease,
the City Forester may order, at his/her sole discretion, all elms within a
radius of one thousand feet (1,000') to be treated after first giving public
notice by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city
setting forth the area to be treated and the time said treating is to be done,
at least twenty-four (24) hours before treating restricting parking in the
affected area. Additionally, written notice shall be mailed to all property
owners within the affected one-thousand-foot (1,000') radius at least five (5)
days prior to treatment. When such notice has been given and parking
restrictions placed in effect, the city shall not allow any claim for damage
caused by the treatment to any vehicle.
   (4)   It shall be unlawful for any person to give, sell, or offer for sale
as firewood any part of a diseased tree of any species of elm, zelkova or
planera. (Ord. 3662, 4-21-2025)

which the approval was granted and upon property sale the entitlement transfers
to the new owner(s) without further application or approval, unless otherwise
conditioned as part of the original approval. Any new owner(s) shall be bound
by the same time limits and conditions of approval as the original special use
permit holder(s).
      B.   A special use permit is not transferable from one (1) property to
another.
      C.   The director may approve or deny specified minor modifications,
provided (1) Such modifications were not the subject of review during the
original public hearing and will not adversely impact adjacent properties, (2)

zoning director if it is determined that any condition of the approved special
use permit or any other city laws, ordinances or statutes are being violated.
      B.   Prior to any revocation, the applicant shall be afforded thirty (30)
days after the date of notification of noncompliance/intent to revoke to become
compliant. Additionally, prior to any revocation, the applicant shall be
afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the council; said hearing must be
requested within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of a notice of intent to
revoke the special use permit.
      C.   Failure to come into compliance within thirty (30) days of the
notification of noncompliance/intent to revoke and failure to request such a
hearing shall result in immediate revocation of the special use permit.
   (13)   Appeals:

10-03-07: TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES:
10-03-07-1: TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY REQUIREMENTS:
Traffic impact study, intersection study, master plan policies, and related
transportation matters.
   (1)   Traffic Studies:
      A.   Requirements And General Information: Traffic studies will be
required in conjunction with private development when the traffic generated
exceeds certain development thresholds.
      B.   Development Studies: Traffic studies will be required for city
roadway or intersection improvement projects. These may vary from a simple one-
page study evaluating existing traffic volumes, accidents and physical
conditions. They can also be a complex analysis of existing and future levels
of service at several locations, on and off the project site, as well as
various possible development and public improvement project scenarios. They may
need to consider various roadway concept alternatives, alignments, modes of
travel and project enhancements.
      C.   Design And Project Studies: Traffic studies may be required for a
variety of issues. The city should be an active participant in the review of
those involving city roads to include those within the city’s impact area.
      D.   Scoping Of the Project: Where many unknown and alternate designs
exist for a project, a scoping study should precede the project design to
clearly define the project scope.
      E.   Traffic Impact Studies Criteria: The City of Caldwell must consider
the impacts of a proposed development on property and transportation
facilities. Therefore, a traffic impact study will be required if the proposed
development generates one hundred (100) or more peak hour vehicle trips; more
than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet of commercial use; or more than fifty
thousand (50,000) square feet of industrial use. Institutional reviews will be
required based upon the city’s experience with other like operations or from
information provided by other jurisdictions in this region. The city may
require an impact study, even if the aforementioned criteria are not exceeded
to resolve unique circumstances. The city may also waive the requirement if, in
the city’s opinion, there are no traffic issues to resolve.
      The type of land use and the trips generated will be determined using the
Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) publication: “Trip Generation - An
Information Report”.
      Typical uses within the commercial, industrial and institutional
categories include (but are not limited to):
         Commercial Category:
         Business park.
         Indoor theater.
         Office building.
         Restaurant.
         Retail store.
         Shopping center.
         Supermarket.
         Industrial Category:
         Heavy industry.
         Industrial park.
         Light industrial.
         Manufacturing.
         Truck/bus terminal.
         Utility plant.
         Warehousing.
         Institutional Category:
         College/university.
         Hospital/nursing home.
         Library.
         Military base.
         Place of worship.
         Prison.
         School.
      The term “dwelling units” used in this policy includes units associated
with hotels, motels and private homes or apartments. The city will consider
proposed developments of other types not listed above and decide the need for a
traffic impact study on a case-by-case basis.
      The developer of a proposed large-scale development should review the
project with the City Engineering staff before submitting a preliminary plat
application.
      The city will decide at that time whether a traffic impact study will be
required and set the study parameters. The impact study area shall include all
roadways and intersections directly joining the proposed development. It shall
include other roadways and intersections that the City believes are affected by
traffic generated by the proposed development.
   (2)   Traffic Impact Considerations:
      A.   The traffic impact study shall identify and consider:
         1.   The continuation of local residential streets, collector streets
and arterial streets. The study shall cover streets from the development
boundaries, to an intersection with existing or proposed residential, collector
or arterial streets as shown on the latest edition of the “Canyon County
Functionally Classified Road Map”.
         2.   Existing land use, roadways, traffic patterns and roadway volume,
and turning movement volume within the study area. The study must consider
average daily traffic and traffic during at least two (2) representative peak
hours.
         3.   Existing levels of service within the study area. This will be
determined using the latest edition of the “Highway Capacity Manual” (HCM) and
existing traffic control devices.
         4.   Planned road improvements and major land developments within the
study area.
         5.   Forecasts of future traffic patterns, roadway capacity and
turning movements in the study area before the proposed development is built.
This establishes “background traffic”. Traffic patterns and roadway capacity
shall be forecast for the built out year and for a twenty (20) year planning
period. Turning movements shall be forecast for the built out year. Traffic
forecasts by COMPASS should be used, when available. Those forecasts shall be
checked for credibility and reconciled with independent forecasts. The study
should include a reasonable rate of regional traffic growth. It should estimate
additional traffic likely to be generated by vacant land development in and
surrounding the area. The basis of development projections will be current
zoning, prepared with advice from staff.
         6.   Trip generation and distribution expected from the proposed
development; this is “site traffic”.
         7.   Forecast of future traffic patterns, roadway capacity volumes,
and turning movements in the study area after the proposed development is fully
built and occupied. These numbers are “site traffic” plus “background traffic”.
         8.   Future levels of service in the study area, with “site traffic”
plus “background traffic”. Forecast levels of service for roadway links and
impacted intersections at the development build out year and twenty (20) years
from the present. Identify all roadway/intersections configurations and traffic
control devices.
         9.   Recommended roadway/pathway improvements and mitigation measures.
This includes location and design of driveways, intersections and traffic
control devices. Include potentially viable non-roadway measures, such as
ridesharing, transit, bicycling incentives and staggered or flexible work
hours.
         10.   School crossings, safe routes to school and bikeways.
         11.   Roadway access control that differs from the city’s general
requirements. Show exceptions where there are special conditions such as
unusually heavy turn storage requirements, high speeds and high traffic
volumes.
         12.   The effects of the traffic from the proposed development on
existing local streets and the effects of traffic from existing local streets
on the proposed development.
   (3)   Average Daily Traffic (ADT): The evaluator needs to estimate ADT for
all street segments in the proposed development likely to have volumes
exceeding one thousand (1,000) vehicles per day. These estimates will help
select the proper street cross section for each segment. Each proposed
collector street should be broken into several segments. The evaluator will
base this on key intersections in the proposed street network. That will reduce
the length of collector width streets required and define the extent of
collector traffic levels in the development. The evaluator will compare project
volumes on streets that provide access to the development with the applicable
threshold volumes. The evaluator should use the Caldwell subdivision ordinance
and adopted planning thresholds for reference purposes.
   (4)   Trip Generation Rates: Trip generation rates used in the impact study
shall be supported by appropriate data presented in the latest edition of the
publication, “Trip Generation Manual”. Other studies recognized by the traffic
engineering profession may be used for analysis purposes. Those conducting
impact studies should consult ITE’s “Traffic Access And Impact Studies For Site
Development” (a recommended practice 1991), and the federal highway
administration’s, “Site Impact Traffic Evaluation (SITE) Handbook” report
number FHWA/PL/85/004, January 1985, or the most recent publication update.
   (5)   Preparation Of Traffic Impact Study: The applicant shall pay for a
traffic impact study commissioned by the city. A qualified professional shall
prepare the traffic impact study. The city shall approve the professional who
will do the study before the work begins. The city engineer or designated staff
member will confirm the qualifications of the proposed professional. The
qualified professional will serve as the city’s primary contact during the
study.
   (6)   Study Boundaries: The boundary of the study area shall be identified
jointly by the professional conducting the study and city staff.
   (7)   Joint Traffic Study: The city may participate or require the
participation of others in a joint traffic study when there is a need to
evaluate some traffic component that has wider application than the proposal at
hand. The joint traffic study will include the elements of the traffic impact
study area required of the development. The developer will pay a negotiated
portion of the study.
   (8)   Master Plans: Developments that are to be platted in multiple phases
may require a master plan. The master plan shall address broad community
development, street network issues and all the elements required in a traffic
impact study. If all of the phases of the proposed development exceed the
threshold requirements, the developer may be required to update the traffic
study when future phases of the project are submitted or in the city’s opinion,
conditions in the area have changed significantly, or if the future phases
deviate significantly from the approved master plan.
   (9)   Traffic Signal Warrants: The traffic signal warrants from the MUTCD
should be used as guidelines to consider the need for a traffic signal at a
location. Other features should be considered such as traffic circulation
patterns; spacing with respect to other controls; and the physical
characteristics of the intersection (such as the horizontal and vertical
curvature). If either the total volume warrant or the volume interruption
warrant are satisfied, it will not be necessary to check warrants 8 through 11
which are primarily special volume warrants. The evaluator should give special
consideration to locations that satisfy the school crossing warrant or the
accident warrant.
   (10)   Level Of Service: Traffic conditions will be measured according to
present and forecasted level of service (LOS) for roadways relative to their
functional classification. Level of service is a measure of the congestion
level on a street in an urban setting; it is typically measured at
intersections. Functional classifications refer to the transportation
distribution characteristics of a roadway. Planning volume thresholds are the
twenty-four (24) hour equivalents of what the typical intersection levels of
services are expected to be along a street based on its number of lanes and
functional classification. Planning thresholds are based on typical
intersection conflicts and intersection designs.
      An arterial street that has the same number of lanes as a collector
street carries more traffic than the collector because it is assumed to receive
sixty percent (60%) more green time as compared to forty percent (40%) green
time for collectors. Planning volume thresholds are used to determine the
needed street section based on future traffic forecasts. Traffic forecasts are
generated from a computer traffic model, which simulates the trips generated by
future land use types, densities and locations routed on an assumed roadway
network.
   (11)   Functional Street Classification: Urban and rural street
classification maps are prepared by COMPASS and adopted by its member agencies,
including the city of Caldwell. The maps depict the current local, collector
and arterial street designations. Several future and arterial streets are shown
on the maps. Not all future collector and arterial streets are indicated. The
city reserves the right to designate future collector streets or upgrade
existing streets as conditions and projections warrant. The functional street
classification map will be relied upon to determine a development’s level of
participation in transportation improvement matters based upon the
development’s anticipated impact on the road system. (Ord. 2506, 7-6-2004)
   (12)   Traffic Impact Mitigation: The applicant shall be responsible for
assuming a proportionate share of the design, construction, installation and
inspections associated with remediating the traffic impacts identified by the
study and/or as identified by the city engineer in his/her review and analysis
of the proposed development and surrounding traffic patterns. Traffic impact
mitigation shall be addressed according to the time frame identified in the
traffic study and/or as identified by the city engineer and shall be required
for any development that is estimated to exceed five hundred (500) vehicle
trips per day, regardless of whether a traffic impact study has been conducted
or not. If a traffic impact study has not been conducted, the vehicle trips per
day for a development shall be estimated using the most current edition of the
ITE “Trip Generation” handbook. The applicant may be allowed, at his/her
option, to contribute monies in lieu of construction, but the basis for the
obligation is for construction. Monetary contributions must be made at a level
commensurate with costs to construct the same by the city and as estimated by
the city. The alternate provision for payment of money is not a requirement, is
for the benefit and convenience of the applicant only and does not constitute
an impact fee. If the traffic mitigation should be deferred the applicant shall
deposit funds in the roadway trust fund, sufficient to cover the determined
proportional traffic impact cost. (Ord. 3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-07-2: APPEALS:
   (1)   Any party aggrieved by a decision of the City Engineer or Public Works
Director in administering traffic study guidelines provided for herein may
appeal said decision to the City Council by filing a written notice of such
appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date of such decision.
   (2)   Appeals to the City Council shall be processed as contested case
pursuant to Caldwell City Code Section
10-03-12. (Ord. 3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-08: SEVERABILITY:
If any provisions of this chapter or the application thereof to any persons or
circumstances are held invalid, the remainder of the chapter or the application
of provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 1451, 12-13-1977)
10-03-09: CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS AND REPEALER:
It is not intended by this chapter to impair or interfere with other
regulations of State or local law, or with private restrictions on the use of
land, improvements and structures. Where this chapter imposes greater
restriction than that imposed by other law or private restrictions, this
chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict
herewith are hereby repealed upon the effective date of this chapter. (Ord.

of proof at an administrative hearing to establish a violation of this chapter,
chapters 11, 12 and/or 13 of this code. The administrative citation and any
additional reports submitted by the citing official shall constitute evidence
of the facts contained in those documents. The administrative hearing officer

         2.   Administrative Citation: The administrative hearing officer shall
issue a written decision to uphold or cancel the administrative citation. If
the administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative citation, the
city shall retain the fine deposited by the responsible person. If the
administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative citation and the fine
has not been deposited because advance deposit has been waived by the city on
the grounds of hardship or otherwise, the administrative hearing officer shall
specify in the decision a payment schedule for the fine. If the administrative
hearing officer cancels the administrative citation, any fine deposited with
the city shall be refunded.
         3.   Administrative Order: With regard to the administrative hearing
officer's decision, it shall be entitled "administrative order". The
administrative hearing officer shall make findings within the administrative
order regarding the existence of the violation(s) specified in the violation
warnings and administrative citation, and regarding whether the responsible
person took the required corrective action within the time period set forth in
the violation warnings. If the administrative hearing officer concludes that
the violation continues to exist, the administrative order shall set forth a
schedule for correction. The administrative order shall set a deadline for
compliance with its terms in the event that the responsible person fails to
file an appeal. If the administrative hearing officer determines that the
violation(s) set forth in the violation warning did not exist, or that the
violation(s) was (were) timely corrected, all proceedings regarding the
violation(s) shall immediately cease and the administrative citations shall be
canceled. If the administrative hearing officer cancels the administrative
citation, any fine deposited with the city shall be refunded.
         4.   Administrative Costs: The administrative hearing officer may
assess against the responsible person administrative costs for any violation
found to exist, or for any violation that was not timely corrected. The
administrative costs include any and all costs incurred by the city in
connection with administrative hearings pertaining to the violation, including,
but not limited to, investigation costs, staffing costs for preparing and
conducting the administrative hearing, and costs for all inspections necessary
to enforce the violation warning, administrative citation and the
administrative order. The administrative order shall specify the date by which
the costs must be paid to the city.
      Q.   Administrative Hearing Application Fee: The city council shall by
resolution establish an application fee to be paid by the person seeking an
administrative appeal hearing.
      R.   Late Payment Charges: Any person who fails to pay to the city on or
before the due date any administrative fine imposed pursuant to the provisions
of this section shall be liable for the payment of late payment charges in the
amount of fifty percent (50%) of the administrative fine payable to the city
over and above the original fine. (Ord. 2789, 10-5-2009)
      S.   Failure To Comply With Administrative Order: Failure to comply with
an administrative order after it becomes final is a misdemeanor. Filing a
criminal misdemeanor action does not preclude the city from using any other
legal remedy available to gain compliance with the administrative order. (Ord.
3576, 3-19-2024)
10-03-11: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   (1)   Authority and Purpose: In accordance with the allowances made by state
law, a property owner or developer may request, or the city may require, that
an application for rezone or zoning map amendment be processed in conjunction
with the execution of a development agreement. Through such agreements, a
property owner or developer may agree to make written conditional commitments
concerning the use or development of a subject parcel in exchange for the
change of zoning requested. The purpose of such agreements shall be to allow
development that provides benefits for both the property owner or developer and
the city by providing a balance between the owner or developer's desire for
certainty in the development process and the city's desire for control of the
impacts of the project.
   (2)   Process:
      A.   Creation and Form. At a minimum, development agreements shall
include the following:
         1.   A legal description of the subject property;
         2.   A description of the uses permitted or conditionally permitted
through special use permit on the land, which may include conceptual site
plans, building elevations showing exterior building treatments and designs,
signage, landscaping and parking designs, and other pertinent exhibits;
         3.   Provisions for any reservation or dedication of land;
         4.   The duration of the agreement; and
         5.   The commitments or other terms of the agreement.
      B.   Commitments and Safeguards. The written commitments or conditions
exacted shall be specific and shall have a reasonable relation to the zoning
change approved. In addition, the following safeguards shall be applied:
         1.   A development agreement shall only be allowed in connection with
annexations or rezones.
         2.   A development agreement shall be binding on the owner of the
parcel, each subsequent owner and each other person acquiring an interest in
the parcel, unless otherwise modified, terminated, or expired.
         3.   A development agreement shall not prevent the city in subsequent
actions applicable to the property from applying new rules, regulations or
policies that do not conflict with commitments applicable to the property set
forth within any duly executed agreement.
         4.   If a commitment involves ongoing performance and the owner or
developer fails to comply with the commitment after completion of construction,
said failure may be dealt with by the city according to the violation and
penalty provisions of this chapter and for specific performance of the
development agreement, including attorney fees and costs associated with the
enforcement of the agreement.
         5.   When a commitment is required to be satisfied prior to completion
of construction and it is not so satisfied, construction shall be halted until
compliance is established.
         6.   The negotiation of a development agreement, and its signature by
the applicant and the owner, does not commit the council to the adoption of the
zoning map amendment; a zoning map amendment subject to a development
agreement, in turn, shall not be effective until such time as all parties have
signed the development agreement, and a notice of development agreement has
been recorded.
         7.   The establishment of a development agreement and the written
commitments contained therein in accordance with the provisions of this section
shall be deemed written consent for the city council to change the zoning of
the subject property to its prior designation upon failure to comply with the
conditions imposed by the agreement.
         8.   Conditional commitments made under such agreements are in
addition to the regulations provided for in the zoning district by ordinance
and are established to ensure compatibility of the resulting land use with the
surrounding area.
         9.   A written development agreement may include commitments for one
or more of the following purposes:
            (a)   To prohibit structures, or uses of land or structures, that
would adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood or conflict with the
comprehensive plan;
            (b)   To entertain allowing a specific use or uses of the parcel
for which the development agreement is sought, including uses in a zone not
normally allowed therein;
            (c)   To conform the zoning map amendment to the comprehensive
plan;
            (d)   To conform development under the zoning map amendment to
existing patterns of development in the surrounding neighborhood;
            (e)   To mitigate the adverse effects of development under the
zoning map amendment on the surrounding neighborhood and on public facilities
and services; or
            (f)   To narrow the permitted or specially permitted uses in the
zone.
            (g)   Limit residential density; or prohibit structures, or uses of
land or structures, otherwise permitted in a zone;
            (h)   Require compliance with a site plan and/or design standards
for structures and other site features;
            (i)   Require compliance with a site plan approved by the council
either in conjunction with the rezoning or under the procedures for a special
use;
            (j)   Require the construction and installation of improvements,
including public improvements; or
            (k)   Impose time limits for taking subsequent development actions.
      C.   Recordation. Development agreements shall take effect and shall be
recorded by the city in the office of the county recorder upon the adoption of
the ordinance establishing the zoning map amendment by the city council.
      D.   Zoning Map Identification. A zoning action subject to a development
agreement shall be identified on the zoning map by the suffix "DA", and the
number of the ordinance applying to the development agreement.
      E.   Development Agreement Expiration. Development agreements shall
expire within five (5) years if no development or improvements have begun on
the subject parcel(s), unless otherwise negotiated in the agreement, or an
request for an extension has been granted.
      F.   Modification, Enforcement, Extension, and Termination.
         1.   Modifications. A development agreement may be modified by request
of an applicant or the city only after an approving vote of the council after
complying with the notice and hearing provisions of this chapter. Modification
of and to an executed agreement shall be required by the planning director or
his/her designee under the following circumstances:
            (a)   A change to any of the terms or conditions of the original
development agreement is proposed;
            (b)   A substantial change to any established positioning of any
structure over 200 square feet in area is proposed;
            (c)   A substantial change to any approved parking or landscaping
area layout or arrangement is proposed;
            (d)   A substantial change to any approved set of building
elevations or exterior appearance or design is proposed;
            (e)   A substantial change to any of the approved land uses listed
within the development agreement; and/or
            (f)   A substantial change to any development agreement for signage
is proposed.
         2.   Enforcement. If a commitment involves ongoing performance and the
owner or developer fails to comply with the commitment after completion of
construction, said failure may be dealt with by the city according to the
violation and penalty provisions of this chapter and for specific performance
of the development agreement, including attorney fees and costs associated with
the enforcement of the agreement.
         3.   Extensions. The period of time for compliance of commitments may
be extended by the city for just cause, and upon application for such by the
owner, after complying with the notice and hearing provisions of this chapter.
In addition, the five-year expiration period may be extended by the city for
just cause, and upon application for such by the owner, after complying with
the notice and hearing provisions of this chapter.
         4.   Termination. A development agreement may be terminated by the
city, and the zoning designation upon which the use is based may be reversed
upon the following:
            (a)   Failure of the owner, developer or each subsequent owner or
person acquiring an interest in the subject parcel to comply with the
commitments in the agreement within two (2) years, and after complying with the
notice and hearing provisions of section 67-6509, Idaho Code.
            (b)   Failure of the owner, developer or each subsequent owner or
person acquiring an interest in the subject parcel to begin development or
improvements on the subject parcel within five (5) years, and after complying
with the notice and hearing provisions of section 67-6509, Idaho Code.
            (c)   Upon termination of the development agreement, the property
may revert to the zone applicable prior to the adoption of the development
agreement or application for zone change, or to the least intensive zoning
classification (low density residential) as deemed appropriate by the Planning
Director. If the zone reverts to the prior zone, all uses of the property which
are not consistent with the subsequently applied zone following termination of
the development agreement shall cease. The owner of the parcel may apply for a
special use of the parcel if such use is a specially permitted use within the
subsequently applied zone. (Ord. 2729, 5-5-2008; Ord. 2755, 9-22-2008; Ord.

zoning or overlay district. In legislative hearings, the record is not limited
to the record developed by the review body. Any and all new evidence may be
received by Council during a legislative hearing regardless of whether the
evidence was introduced in prior procedural steps.
         2.   Quasi-Judicial: Quasi-judicial hearings are hearings in which the
review bodies are making decisions on the application of policy to a specific
development application.
      B.   Decisions: The decision body shall approve, approve with conditions,
approve with modifications, or deny an application based upon the applicable
standards and criteria in this Code and the City of Caldwell Comprehensive
Plan. Whenever a governing board or zoning or planning and zoning commission
grants or denies an application, it shall specify:
         1.   The ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application;
         2.   The reasons for approval or denial; and
         3.   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain
approval.
      C.   Decision Criteria: A decision body authorized to act under this Code
shall base a decision on the following criteria and any specific criteria
indicated elsewhere in this chapter for the specific type of application.
         1.   The approval is consistent with the goals, policies, and intent
of the adopted Comprehensive Plan; and
         2.   The approval is consistent with the general purpose of this Code
stated in Section
10-01-02 (2) and
11-01-02 (1).
      D.   Conditions: A decision body authorized to act under this Code may
impose conditions as needed to ensure that the approval is consistent with the
adopted Comprehensive Plan and this Code.
      E.   Hearing Records: A record of the hearings, findings made, and
actions taken by the commission and/or city council shall be maintained by the
city.
      F.   Notice Of Decisions: The approval or denial of any application
required or authorized pursuant to Title 67, Chapter 65, Idaho Code, shall be
in writing and accompanied by a reasoned statement. A reasoned statement
explains the criteria and standards considered relevant, states the relevant
contested facts relied upon, and explains the rationale for the decision based
on the applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan, relevant ordinance and
statutory provisions, pertinent constitutional principles and factual
information contained in the record. Every final decision rendered shall
provide or be accompanied by notice to the applicant regarding the applicant's
right to request a regulatory taking analysis pursuant to section 67-8003,
Idaho Code. An applicant denied an application or aggrieved by a final decision
concerning matters identified in section 67-6521(1)(a), Idaho Code, may within
twenty-eight (28) days after all remedies have been exhausted under local
ordinance seek judicial review under the procedures provided by Title 67,
Chapter 52, Idaho Code.
      G.   Request For Reconsideration By Affected Persons: On any application
brought before the city council affecting the use, occupancy or development of
real property, including, but not limited to, those matters governed by the
Idaho Local Land Use Planning Act, found at Idaho Code section 67-6501 et seq.,
or the Caldwell Zoning Ordinance, found in this title, a party may request that
the city council reconsider a decision pursuant to the terms of this section.
Decisions and recommendations of the planning and zoning commission are not
subject to reconsideration but may be appealed to the city council as provided
in this title.
   Except that, decisions on annexations, being legislative decisions, do not
qualify for reconsideration, and requests for reconsideration on annexations
are not required to be heard by the City Council. This exception does not apply
to city-initiated annexations subject to judicial review in accordance with
Chapter 2, Title 50, Idaho Code.
         1.   As required by Idaho Code section 67-6535(2)(b), any applicant or
affected person who wishes to seek judicial review of compliance with the
provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6535, must first seek reconsideration of
the final decision within fourteen (14) days.
         2.   Such written request must be delivered to the city clerk within
that time frame and must identify specific deficiencies in the decision for
which reconsideration is sought. Upon reconsideration, the decision may be
affirmed, reversed or modified after compliance with applicable procedural
standards.
         3.   The city council shall review the petition for reconsideration at
a regular meeting and decide whether to reconsider the matter.
         4.   The city council may consider its decision only if it finds any
of the following:
            (A)   There was a clerical error in the decision;
            (B)   The decision resulted from fraud or mistake;
            (C)   There is new evidence for the record or a change in
circumstances;
            (D)   There was a procedural error;
            (E)   The council previously rejected the application by a tie
vote; or
            (F)   The decision was made in violation of substantive law.
         5.   If the city council chooses to reconsider the final decision, the
city council shall provide the applicant or affected person a written decision
on such action. If the city council grants reconsideration in whole or in part,
a hearing before the city council will be scheduled to address the specific
deficiencies identified by the applicant or affected person, which shall be
conducted pursuant to the public notice procedures set forth in this section.
The issues examined upon reconsideration shall be limited to issues raised by
the petition for reconsideration and the record previously established, as well
as the applicable law. The cost of all required notices shall be borne by the
party(ies) seeking reconsideration of the decision and paid in advance.
         6.   Following the hearing on the reconsideration, the city council
may affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, its' prior decision and
shall provide a written decision to the applicant and the affected person(s)
within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for reconsideration. If the
city council fails to timely decide, the request for reconsideration is deemed
denied. A decision shall not be deemed final for purposes of judicial review
unless the process required in this subsection has been followed. The twenty-
eight (28) day time frame for seeking judicial review is tolled until the date
of the written decision regarding reconsideration or the expiration of the
sixty (60) day reconsideration period, whichever occurs first.
         7.   Once the council has reconsidered any of its decisions relating
to a given application, as set forth hereinabove, it may not entertain any
additional or subsequent request for reconsideration, whether by the same or
any other interested party.
         8.   A failure to request reconsideration is a failure of the
applicant or affected party to exhaust administrative remedies.
      H.   Appeals:
         1.   Any applicant or party aggrieved by a decision of the planning
and zoning commission, hearing examiner, or other hearing body, with respect to
the provisions of this article may appeal that decision to the city council by
filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days
following the date upon which the decision was made.
         2.   Content Of Appeal: All appeals shall be in writing and shall
contain the following:
            (A)   The appellant's name, address, and telephone number;
            (B)   The appellant's statement describing his or her standing to

the subject of the appeal;
            (D)   The appellant's statement of grounds for the appeal
addressing why the appellant believes the decision to be unlawful or
inappropriate to the factual circumstances.
         3.   Setting Of Appeal Hearing: Upon the timely filing of appeal, the
city shall set the date, time and place for the appeal to be heard by the city
council.
         4.   Burden Of Proof: The appellant shall bear the burden of proving
the decision was unlawful or inappropriate to the factual circumstances.
         5.   The council shall give legal public notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time following the hearing.
At the hearing, any affected party may appear in person, by agent or attorney.

The Director will determine whether a project is exempt from Design Review and
whether a Design Review Application is subject to staff-level approval from the
Community Development Director, or from the Design Review Commission or
Historic Commission.
   (1)   Administrative Level Design Review:
      A.   Administrative level design review is a review completed at a staff
level and is intended for projects that are minor in nature and impact, but
that are not exempt from the Design Review process. The following are
considered “minor” projects and require administrative staff-level design
review, unless otherwise noted herein. The Director has the authority to
require any minor project to go before the Design Review Commission due to the
complexity of the project, the nature of its surroundings, or due to a request
for alternative compliance.
         1.   A single stand-alone commercial or mixed-use building on a site
not exceeding 5,000 square feet gross floor area that is not on a lot abutting
a residential zoning district or residential use; except for within the
downtown districts;
         2.   A single stand-alone industrial building on a site not exceeding
20,000 square feet gross floor area that is not on a lot or parcel abutting a
residential zoning district or a residential use;

         11.   Landscaping improvements or alterations not associated with a
building or structure;
         12.   Replacement of windows and/or doors on structures within the
Downtown Districts.
   (2)   Commission Level Design Review: A commission level design review is
required for all projects not classified as minor in 10-02-13-1 (1), or as
referred by the Director. Project proposals under commission level are reviewed
by the Design Review Commission during a noticed public hearing. (Ord. 3663, 4-
21-2025)
10-03-13-3: APPLICATION SUBMITTAL AND PROCESSING:
   (1)   Application Submission:
      A.   Any person or entity proposing to construct or locate within the
City any improvement subject to Design Review, shall file an application for
review of the project. The application shall be accompanied by architectural
and site development drawings, drawn to scale and shall include all information
specified in the application form and checklist. Design Review Staff may
require additional information from applicants which is pertinent to the
application necessary to evaluate the project. All applicable fees must be paid
prior to formal acceptance of any application.
      B.   Design reviews are conducted prior to final approval of any land use
entitlements or prior to the final approval of permits (if no land use
entitlements are required).
   (2)   Application Processing: Once the application has been formally
accepted, the director, or his/her designee, will examine the application and
route the application for administrative staff level review or place the
application on the hearing schedule for the next available public hearing
before the Design Review Commission.
   (3)   Hearing Dates; Commission Level: Hearing dates for commission levels
reviews are dependent on the date of final acceptance of the application, and
the number of applications already scheduled on a specific hearing date.
   (4)   Noticing: Noticing is not required for administrative level staff
reviews. Commission level staff reviews require an agenda to be posted in
accordance with the Idaho Open Meeting Laws. Noticing by mail to adjacent
property owners is not required. (Ord. 3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-13-4: DESIGN REVIEW EXPIRATION:
Design Review approval shall expire two (2) years from the initial date of
approval unless substantial construction has commenced under valid permits.
Design Review approval may be extended by the Director upon application for up
to one (1) additional year from the date of expiration. A fee may be imposed by
the city to process extension requests. Substantial alterations to the approved
design associated with a development shall require a new application. (Ord.
3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-13-5: PROHIBITIONS:
No building permit, license, certificate of occupancy, entitlement or other
approval shall be issued or given by the City or by any department thereof with

improvement has been approved as in accordance with this section and a zoning
certificate issued. (Ord. 3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-13-6: NUISANCES:
Any improvement constructed, located, repaired, altered or maintained in
violation of the provisions hereof and in this chapter is hereby declared to be
unlawful and a public nuisance, abatable in the manner provided for elsewhere
in this Code. (Ord. 3663, 4-21-2025)
10-03-14: DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
10-03-14-1: SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE:
   (1)   Short Title: This section shall be known and may be cited as the CITY
OF CALDWWELL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE ORDINANCE.
   (2)   Authority: This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the city's general
police powers pursuant to the authority granted to the city by title 50, Idaho
Code, and pursuant to the authority granted to the city by section 67-8201 et
seq., Idaho Code. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-2: FINDINGS; GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (1)   The city council of the city of Caldwell, Idaho finds that:
      A.   The City of Caldwell has established and consulted with a
development impact fee advisory committee;
      B.   All new residential and non-residential growth and development
creates an impact and imposes increasing demands upon public facilities and
services.
      C.   The revenues generated from new residential and non-residential
growth and development often do not generate sufficient general funds to
provide the necessary improvements of these public facilities to accommodate
new growth and development.
      D.   New growth and development are expected to continue and will place
ever increasing demands on the city to provide and expand the public facilities
to serve new growth and development.
      E.   Impact fees provide an equitable program for planning and financing
public facilities needed to serve new growth and development and are necessary
in order to promote and accommodate orderly growth and development and to
protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
city.
      F.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city
to impose a development impact fee that does not exceed a proportionate share
of the actual costs of system improvements, or reasonable estimates of such
costs, to accommodate new growth and development, as determined and in
accordance with section 67-8207, Idaho Code.
      G.   This ordinance creates a system by which impact fees paid by new
growth and development will be used to finance, defray or to provide capital
improvements for the public facilities in ways that benefit the development for
which impact fees were paid.
      H.   This ordinance creates a system under which impact fees shall not be
used to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities, or to replace or
rehabilitate existing public facilities, or to pay for routine operation or
maintenance of those public facilities.
      I.   This ordinance is consistent with all applicable provisions of title
67, chapter 82, Idaho Code, concerning impact fee ordinances.
      J.   The impact fee study used a calculation methodology in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles that is net of credits for the
present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development
based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available
to pay for system improvements, including taxes, assessments, user fees, and
intergovernmental transfers, and included consideration of the following
factors:
         1.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
         2.   The means by which existing system improvements have been
financed;
         3.   The extent to which the new growth and development will
contribute to the cost of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or
developer or landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost
of system improvements through developer or landowner contributions;
         4.   The extent to which the new growth and development is required to
contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
         5.   The extent to which the new growth and development should be
credited for providing system improvements, without charge to other properties
within the service area;
         6.   Extraordinary costs incurred in serving the new growth and
development;
         7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
impact fees paid at different times;
         8.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, transfers, and
special taxation; and
         9.   The method for computing the impact fees for each service
category and different land uses.
      K.   The city has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in
the city of Caldwell comprehensive plan and other adopted master plans, which
in turn helped formulate the capital improvement plans listed in this
ordinance.
      L.   The impact fee studies and/or analysis, impact fees, and capital
improvement plans are consistent with the city of Caldwell comprehensive plan.
      M.   The impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and
analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new growth and
development on the public facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such public
facilities created by new growth and development.
      N.   The maximum allowable impact fees described in this article are
based on the impact fee studies, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for the public facilities to serve new growth and development that
will pay the impact fees.
      O.   The police, fire, parks, and traffic public facilities and capital
improvements included in the calculation of impact fees in the impact fee study
will benefit all new growth and development throughout the city, and it is
therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city as a single service area
for purposes of calculating, collecting and spending the impact fees collected.
      P.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this
ordinance and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
      Q.   Based on the city of Caldwell comprehensive plan, as amended,
adopted by the city pursuant to title 67, chapter 65, Idaho Code, and the
general governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare
of the citizens of the city, it is necessary to establish development impact
fees on all new development to accommodate growth and the additional demand on
public services and facilities that it creates in accordance with title 67,
chapter 82, Idaho Code. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-3: EFFECTIVE DATE:

building permit (or installation permit in the case of a manufactured home) for
a dwelling unit or a non-residential building.
   (3)   Police Impact Fees:
      A.   There is hereby established a police impact fee service area, to
include all land within the city limits.

a dwelling unit or a non-residential building.
   (4)   Traffic Impact Fees:
      A.   There is hereby established a traffic impact fee service area, to
include all land within the city limits.

      C.   Traffic impact fees shall be required as a condition of approval of
all residential and non-residential development in the service area for which a
building permit is required and shall be payable prior to the issuance of any
building permit (or installation permit in the case of a manufactured home) for
a dwelling unit or a non-residential building. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-6: COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   (1)   The methodology adopted for the purpose of determining impact fees
shall be based upon the assumptions set forth in the impact fee study.
   (2)   Expansion, Change of Use: If development results in either the
expansion of an existing nonresidential land use, a change from a
nonresidential land use type to a different nonresidential land use type, or a
change from a residential to nonresidential land use type, then an impact fee
shall be assessed only for the additional impact attributable to the expansion,
change or more intensive use.
   (3)   Removal, Demolish of Building; Replacement Structure: When a building
or structure will be removed or demolished and impact fees for such building or
structure were paid, the fee payer shall pay an impact fee based upon the
difference between the fee that would have been paid for the previous structure
and the fee for the new structure on the site; provided, that the prior
structure was removed or demolished not more than ten (10) years prior to the
application for a building permit and documentation of its previous existence
and size is provided to the Impact Fee Administrator. In all other cases, the
replacement structure will be treated as a new development.
   (4)   Nonconformance With Land Use Category: If the proposed development
does not conform to a land use category identified by the most current adopted
impact fee study, then the Impact Fee Administrator shall apply the land use
category that most closely resembles the proposed use.
   (5)   Extraordinary Impact:
      A.   The city recognizes that there may be circumstances where the
anticipated fiscal impacts of a proposed development are of such magnitude that
the city may be unable to accommodate the development without excessive or
unscheduled public expenditures that exceed the amount of the anticipated
impact fees from such development.
      B.   If the city determines that a proposed development would create such
an extraordinary impact on the city's police, fire, and/or parks and recreation
public facilities, the city may refuse to approve the proposed development. In
the alternative, the city may calculate a pro rata share per dwelling unit, or
square feet of nonresidential buildings, as applicable, of the extraordinary
impact and charge a reasonable extraordinary impact fee that is greater than
would ordinarily be charged.
   (3)   A fee payor required by this ordinance to pay an impact fee may choose
to have the amount of such impact fee determined pursuant to either the impact
fee schedule(s) or subsections
10-03-14-8 of this section. If the fee payor chooses to have the amount of such
impact fee determined pursuant to subsections
10-03-14-8 this section, such impact fee shall be subject to the adjustment
described in subsection
10-03-14-10 of this section, if applicable. If the project is a mix of those
uses listed on the fee schedule, then the impact fees shall be determined by
adding up the impact fees that would be payable for each use as if it were a
freestanding use pursuant to the fee schedule.
   (4)   If the city discovers an error in its impact fee formula that results
in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share, city shall, at the
time of assessment on a case-by-case basis, adjust the impact fee to collect no
more than a proportionate share or discontinue the collection of any impact
fees until the error is corrected by ordinance. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-7: PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
   (1)   Payment Required:
      A.   The fee payers shall pay all impact fees prior to the issuance of a
building permit, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City and the fee
payer. No construction shall commence, nor shall the City issue a building
permit unless and until the fee payer has satisfied the provisions of this
ordinance.
      B.   Applications for building permits filed shall be subject to the
provisions of the most current ordinance in effect at the time of application.
      C.   Applications filed, but which expire or are revoked, shall be
subject to the provisions of the most current ordinance in effect at the time
of reapplication. In the event that an amendment results in a change in the
amount of impact fees charged for a particular category of public facility or
improvement, the fee payer shall pay the impact fee amount in effect upon the
date of his or her reapplication.
      D.   If a building permit expires or is revoked and development or
construction does not commence, the owner of record shall be entitled to a
refund of previously paid impact fees for that development as set forth by
subsection
10-03-14-11 of this section. The owner of record shall not receive a refund for
proposed development activity resulting in a negative fee calculation or in
cases in which final City approval has not occurred.
      E.   All impact fees paid by a fee payor pursuant to this section shall
be promptly deposited in the impact fee fund described in subsection
10-03-14-12 of this section. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-8: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
An individual assessment of impact fees is permitted when the fee payer
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the established impact fee
is inappropriate.
   (1)   Application: Written application for individual assessment shall be
made to the impact fee administrator at any time prior to receiving building
permit(s). Late applications for individual assessment of impact fees may be
considered for a period of sixty (60) days after the receipt of a building
permit only if the fee payor makes a showing that the facts supporting such
application were not known or discoverable prior to receipt of a building
permit and that undue hardship would result if said application is not
considered.
   (2)   Cost to Fee Payor: Such independent impact fee calculation study for
the fee payor's development shall be prepared at the fee payor's cost by a
qualified professional and contain studies, data and other relevant information
and be submitted to the fee administrator for review. Any such study shall be
based on the same methodology and the same level of service standards,
improvements and costs used in the impact fee study and must document the
methodologies and assumptions used.
   (3)   Professional Consultant Review: The city may hire a professional
consultant to review any independent impact fee calculation study on behalf of
the city and may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payor.
   (4)   Any independent impact fee calculation study submitted by a fee payor
may be accepted, rejected or accepted with modifications by the city as the
basis for calculating impact fees. The city shall not be required to accept any
study or documentation the city reasonably deems to be inaccurate or unreliable
and shall have the authority to request that the fee payor submit additional or
different documentation for consideration in connection with review of any
independent impact fee calculation. If such additional or different
documentation is accepted or accepted with modifications as a more accurate
measure of the impact fees due in connection with fee payor's proposed
development than the applicable impact fees set forth in the fee schedule, then
the impact fee due under this article shall be calculated according to such
documentation.
   (5)   Written Decision: The Impact Fee Administrator shall render a written
decision regarding the individual assessment within thirty (30) days of receipt
of the application. The decision by the Impact Fee Administrator shall include
an explanation of the calculation of the impact and an explanation of factors
considered under Idaho Code section 67-8707 and shall specify the system
improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used. The written
decision shall also include an explanation of the following factors considered:
      A.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
      B.   The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
      C.   The extent to which the new growth and development will contribute
to the cost of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or developer
or landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system
improvements through developer or landowner contributions;
      D.   The extent to which the new growth and development is required to
contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
      E.   The extent to which the new growth and development should be
credited for providing system improvements, without charge to other properties
within the service area;
      F.   Extraordinary costs incurred in serving the new growth and
development (if any);
      G.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
impact fees paid at different times; and
      H.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, transfers, and
special taxation. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)
10-03-14-9: EXEMPT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES:
   (1)   Claim Of Exemption: A fee payer shall claim an exempt development
activity upon application for a building permit.
   (2)    Activities Specified: The following development activities shall be
exempted from the payment of impact fees imposed by this section:
      A.   Rebuild or Replacement: Rebuilding or replacing a dwelling unit or
the same amount of square feet of a nonresidential structure on the same lot
and existing on the effective date of this article provided that the rebuilt or
replaced dwelling unit or nonresidential structure does not increase the need
for police, fire, parks or transportation public facilities or system
improvements.
      B.   Detached Accessory Structures / Additions: Construction of an
unoccupied, detached accessory structure, or addition of uses related to a
dwelling unit unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the use creates a
significant impact on the capacity of system improvements.
      C.   Remodels or Repairs: Remodeling or repairing a dwelling unit or a
nonresidential structure in a manner that does not increase the need for
police, fire, parks, or transportation public facilities or system
improvements.
      D.   Destroyed Structures: Rebuilding or replacing a structure destroyed
or damaged by fire or other catastrophe, with a new structure which does not
increase the impact over that attributable to the destroyed or damaged
structure; provided that the structure is rebuilt and ready for occupancy
within two (2) years of its destruction.
      E.   Temporary Uses: Placing a temporary construction trailer or office
on a site.
      F.   Modular Buildings and Manufactured Homes: An impact fee will be
assessed for installation of a modular building or manufactured home unless the
fee payor can demonstrate by documentation such as utility bills and tax
records, either: a) that a modular building or manufactured home was legally in
place on the lot or space prior to the effective date of this article; or b)
that an impact fee has been paid previously for the installation of a modular
building or manufactured home on that same lot or space.
      G.   Affordable Housing: Developments determined by the city council that
provide affordable housing may be exempt from the impact fee requirement,
provided that the exempt development's proportionate share of system
improvements is funded through a revenue source other than impact fees.
         1.   Current housing affordability guidelines published by the U.S.
department of housing and urban development ("HUD") shall be used to determine
whether dwelling units in the development qualify as affordable housing.
         2.   Affordable housing projects are required to demonstrate that they
will provide dwelling units to eligible families based on HUD income and family
size guidelines.
         3.   Providers of affordable housing dwelling units must demonstrate a
long-term commitment to providing affordable housing for a period of not less
than twenty (20) years. Affordability of the designated percentage of the
development shall be ensured through covenants and deed restrictions at the
discretion of the city in consultation with the city attorney. (Ord. 3642, 1-
21-2025)
10-03-14-10: IMPACT FEE OFFSETS AND CREDITS:
   (1)   A fee payer shall receive credit or reimbursement for the present
value of any system improvement, the value of dedication of real property to
the City, or other contribution required by the City from the developer for
system improvements of the category for which the impact fee is being collected
in accordance with this section.
      A.   System Improvements:
         1.   All system improvements constructed, funded or contributed for
police, fire, parks and traffic capital improvements for which an impact fee is
imposed, over and above those required by the city in connection with new
development, shall result in either a credit on future impact fees or
reimbursement (at the fee payor's option) for such excess to be paid by future
development that benefits from such system improvements. However, no credit or
reimbursement shall be provided for: a) project improvements; b) any
construction, funding or contribution not agreed to in writing by the city
prior to commencement of such construction, funding or contribution; and c) any
construction, funding or contribution of a type of capital improvements not
included in the calculation of the applicable impact fee.
         2.   Approved credits for contribution or construction of system
improvements shall generally become effective when: a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the city; and b) all
design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and acceptance procedures
have been completed in compliance with all applicable requirements of the city.
Approved credits for the construction of system improvements may become
effective at an earlier date if the fee payor posts security in the form of a
performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement in the
amount and under terms reasonably acceptable to the city.
      B.   Land Dedications:
         1.   Credit for land dedications shall, at the fee payor's option, be
valued at: a) one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the Canyon County assessor; or b) that
fair market value established by an MAI appraiser reasonably acceptable to the
city in an appraisal paid for by the fee payor. Credit for contribution or
construction of system improvements shall be valued by the city based on
complete engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates
submitted by the fee payor to the city, which estimates shall be revised as
actual costs become available. The city shall determine the amount of credit
due based on the information submitted, or, if the city determines that such
information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or
construction costs reasonably acceptable to the city as a more accurate measure
of the value of the offered system improvements to the city.
         2.   Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the city in a form reasonably acceptable to the
city at no cost to the city and has been accepted by the city.
   (2)   Calculation of Credits and Reimbursements:
      A.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project, credit or
reimbursement (at the fee payor's option) shall be given for the present value
of any construction of system improvements or contribution of land or money
required by the city from the fee payor for system improvements of the category
for which the impact fee is being collected, including system improvements paid
for through local improvement district assessments.
      B.   In the calculation of impact fees for a project pursuant to section
10-03-14-7, credit shall be given for the present value of all tax and user fee
revenue generated by the fee payor within the service area and used by the city
for system improvements of the category for which the impact fee is being
collected. If the amount of such credit exceeds the impact fee for a project,
the fee payor shall receive a credit on future impact fees.
   (3)   Approved Credits and Reimbursements:
      A.   Approved credits or reimbursement shall only be used to reduce the
amount of the impact fee of the category for which the impact fee is otherwise
due, and shall not be paid to the fee payor in cash or in credits against any
other monies due from the fee payor to the city.
      B.   If credit or reimbursement is due to the fee payor, the city and fee
payor shall enter into a written agreement, negotiated in good faith, prior to
the construction, funding or contribution. The written agreement shall include,
without limitation:
         1.   A description of the construction, funding or contribution of
system improvements including, in the case of real property, a legal
description of the real property;
         2.   A description as to how the system improvements are to be valued;
         3.   The amount of the credit or the amount, time and form of
reimbursement;
         4.   Instructions as to how the capital improvements should be
provided to the city to ensure full transfer of ownership; and
         5.   The circumstances under which the credit or reimbursement is
deemed effective.
      To assist in such reimbursement, the city shall continue to collect
impact fees from other developers whose proposed developments will benefit from
such construction, funding or contribution, and will promptly transfer such
funds to the fee payor. If a successor in interest claims a reimbursement or
credit, the impact fee administrator may require written documentation that
such rights have been conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested
reimbursement or credit.
   (4)   Use of Approved Credits and Reimbursements:
      A.   Approved credits or reimbursements shall only be used to reduce the
amount of the impact fee of the category for which the impact fee is otherwise
due and shall not be paid to the fee payor in cash or in credits against any
other monies due from the fee payor to the city.
      B.   Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of impact fees of
the category for which the impact fee is being collected in connection with any
new growth and development until the amount of the credit is exhausted.
      C.   Each time a request to use approved credits is presented to the
city, the city shall reduce the amount of the applicable impact fee otherwise
due from the fee payor and shall note in the city records the amount of credit
remaining, if any.
      D.   Upon request of the fee payor, the city shall issue a letter stating
the amount of credit available. If the credit has not been exhausted within
eight (8) years of the date of issuance of the first building permit for which
an impact fee was due and payable, or within such other time period as may be
designated in writing by the city, such credit shall lapse, unless a refund of
the remaining credit is applied for as set forth in subsection
10-03-14-11 of this section.
   (5)   Transfer of Credits: Credit may only be transferred by a fee payor
that has received credit to such fee payor's successor in interest. The credit
may be used only to offset impact fees for the same category for which the
credit was issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument
clearly identifying which credits are being transferred, the dollar amount of
the credit being transferred, and the system improvements for which the credit
was issued. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor
and transferee, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the fee
administrator for documentation of the transfer before the transfer shall be
deemed effective.
   (6)   Limitations: All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be
subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this
chapter:
      A.   No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or
construction of required project improvements or site related facilities.
      B.   A fee payer shall not receive an offset or credit in excess of that
amount to be collected from the assessed impact fee.
      C.   The unit costs used to calculate the offsets or credits shall not
exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the CIP(s) for
the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is
imposed.
      D.   The City will not reimburse the property owner or fee payer for an
offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected
pursuant to this ordinance or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees
due for the new development for the category of capital improvement.
      E.   The amount of any offset or credit shall not include the amount
attributable to participation by the City in the development.
      F.   No fee payor shall be required to construct, fund or contribute any
capital improvement to meet the same need for police, fire, parks, and traffic
capital improvements for which an impact fee is imposed. (Ord. 3642, 1-21-2025)

review of the impact fee paid or the completion of an individual assessment
determines that the fee exceeded the proportionate share to which the city was
entitled. Only upon written authorization from the property owner may the
refund be issued to another designated party, if the developer or fee payer is
not the property owner.
      C.   If a building permit or permit for installation of a manufactured
home is revoked or abandoned.
      D.   If the City, after collecting the fee when service is not available,
fails to appropriate and expend the collected development impact fee pursuant
to Idaho Code section 67-8210(4) or this section.

(90) days after the city determines that a refund is due, the city shall:
      A.   Provide written notice of entitlement to a refund, to the owner of
record and the fee payor who paid the impact fees at the address shown on the
application for development approval, or to a successor in interest who has
notified the city of a transfer of the right or entitlement to a refund and who
has provided the city with a mailing address; and
      B.   Publish the notice of entitlement to a refund within thirty (30)

10-03-16: ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE:
   (1)   Purpose and Applicability: It is recognized by the City that the
regulations of Caldwell Chapter 10, Zoning Regulations cannot anticipate all
specific circumstances of individual development applications. It is also
recognized that there may be applications or solutions which are in keeping
with the spirit and intent of these Articles but were not anticipated in a
specific regulation. Therefore, planning and zoning may allow for an
alternative method of compliance of the articles or sections specified in
10-03-16 (2) when explicit compliance is not feasible and the alternative
complies with the spirit and intent of the applicable code and furthers the
purposes of said applicable code to the same extent, or more, than the baseline
requirement.
   (2)   TABLE 10-03-16:
Articles and/or Sections
Articles and/or Sections
Off Street Parking Standards

requiring designs that conflict with the articles noted in the table above;
      D.   An alternative design method would provide additional environmental
quality benefits;
      E.   The proposed alternative includes innovative design features based
on smart growth principles, a unique targeted demographic, or other
architectural and/or site design features that promote placemaking and
walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods;
      F.   When a project contains deed restricted affordable housing.
   (4)   Standard and Precedent: Any proposed alternative method of compliance
shall demonstrate an equal or superior means of compliance, and any approval
thereof shall not establish any precedent for acceptance in other cases.
   (5)   Required Findings: In order to grant approval for an Alternative
Method of Compliance to this chapter, the Director shall determine the
following:
      A.   Alternative is consistent with the purpose of the applicable article
or a specific master plan;
      B.   Strict adherence or application of the requirements are not
feasible;
      C.   The alternative method of compliance provides an equal or superior
means for meeting the requirements;
      D.   The alternative means will not adversely affect a neighboring
property or resident and will not be materially detrimental to the public
welfare or impair the intended uses and character of the surrounding
properties;
      E.   Reflects an innovative or unique design that conforms to the
requirements of the applicable article to the greatest extent possible but
offers alternatives for addressing the intent of the standards by maintaining
or exceeding the standards; and/or,
      F.   Includes a design required to maintain consistency and compatibility
within an existing development.
   (6)   Minimum Submittal Requirements:
      A.   Narrative describing the proposed alternative(s), the specific
standard(s) requiring deviation, and how the proposed alternative(s) is an
equal or superior means of meeting each applicable standard that is part of the
request.

density bonus).
            (B)   1-point shall equal 25% of the available density bonus.
            (C)   2-points shall equal 50% of the available density bonus.
            (D)   3-points shall equal 75% of the available density bonus.
            (E)   4-points shall equal the full, 100%, of the available density
bonus.

   (1)   Applicability: The zoning district regulations and standards
established in this section shall apply to all residential zoning districts
established in this section, unless specifically stated otherwise in a specific
article in this chapter. (Ord. 3664, 4-21-2025)
10-05-02: DISTRICTS:
   (1)   Intent: Caldwell’s residential (R) zoning districts are primarily
intended to create, maintain, and promote a variety of housing opportunities
for individual households and to maintain the desired physical character of
existing and developing neighborhoods. While the districts primarily
accommodate residential use types, some nonresidential uses are also allowed.
The R district standards provide development flexibility, while at the same
time helping to ensure that new development is compatible with the city’s many
neighborhoods. In addition, the regulations offer certainty for property
owners, developers, and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed.
   (2)   District Map Symbol / Names: The city’s residential zoning districts
are listed below. Changes have been made to the zoning district names, which
has no impact on current land use entitlements or property rights.
   When this zoning and development code refers to “residential” zoning
districts or “R”, “RS” districts, it refers to these districts.

   (3)   District Purpose Statements:
      A.   RS-1 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that provides areas which
are characterized by large residential lots that help transition Caldwell’s
denser neighborhoods to the agricultural surroundings. This zone accommodates
low-density single-family residential dwelling units (including accessory
dwelling units) and agricultural type land uses, while protecting and enhancing
surrounding county areas that are more rural in character. The RS-1 district is
applied to areas that are at the outer edge of the city, closest to the
boundary between the city’s planning area and the county’s planning area.
      B.   RS-2 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that provides areas which
are characterized by large residential lots, although slightly smaller
residential lots than within the RS-1 zone, that accommodate low density
single-family residential dwelling units (including accessory dwelling units).
The RS-2 zone serves as a transition between Caldwell’s denser neighborhoods
and the RS-1 zone.
      C.   R-1 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodate single-
family residential (including accessory dwelling units), townhomes, and
duplexes. Small-scale commercial uses may be found at major intersections of
arterial and collector roadways, along highway frontages, or as part of a
planned unit development or master planned community, in order to provide
greater access of services to the surrounding neighborhoods.
      D.   R-2 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodates a larger
variety of lot sizes and housing types. This includes single-family residential
(including accessory dwelling units) and missing middle housing types such as
townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, cottage courts, small scale multi-
family, or mansion house apartments. Supporting or secondary land uses may
include small-scale mixed-use or live/work housing types, and commercial
activities and services that are generally only found at major intersections of
arterial and collector roadways.
      E.   R-3 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that which allows for
multifamily, townhomes, row-housing, mixed-use buildings, and live/work units.
Single family may be present in forms such as small lot development, infill, or
cottage courts. This zone is situated along or near major streets such as
collectors and arterials. It is also generally located near pedestrian
connections and commercial services. Supporting or secondary land uses may
include medium scale commercial along major roadways or within a mixed-use
development. This district may serve as a buffer between R-2 Zones and
nonresidential or mixed-use zones. (Ord. 3664, 4-21-2025)
10-05-03: USES:
   (1)   Purpose: This section sets forth the permitted and specially permitted
uses Caldwell’s residential zoning districts. For Overlay Zoning Districts, see
Chapter 10, Article 11.
   (2)   Explanation and Key to Land Use Table Abbreviations:
      A.   Permitted Uses (P): A “P” in a cell indicates that a use is allowed
by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      B.   Administrative Development Review (ADR): An “ADR” in a cell
indicates the use is allowed by right but requires the submission of an
Administrative Review application and the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance prior to submission of building permits and the commencement of any
construction. In addition, all land uses allowed by right in which a building
permit is not required will require the submission of an Administrative
Development Review (ADR) application to allow for the review of the land use,
site plan, parking, landscaping and compliance with all other applicable city
code regulations and laws.
      C.   Special Use Permit (SUP). A “SUP” in a cell indicates that the use
is allowed in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a
special use, by the commission or hearing examiner in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of this chapter. A “SUP/C” in a cell indicates
that the use is allowed in the respective zoning district only after it has
been reviewed and approved by the City Council.
         1.   Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter.
         2.   The “SUP” or “SUP/C” designation in a given district does not
constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be permitted.
Rather, each special use permit application shall be evaluated as to its
probable effect on adjacent properties and surrounding areas, among other
factors, and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied pursuant to
the procedures in Section
10-03-04, Special Use Permits.
      D.   Uses Accessory to the Principal Use (A). An “A” in a cell indicates
the land use is permitted only as an accessory land use to an approved
principal use only.
      E.   Temporary Use Only (TUP). A “TUP” in any cell indicates that the use
is only permitted as a temporary use only. Temporary use permits may be
required in accordance with Section
10-12-03-34.
      F.   Specific Use Provisions (*). A “*” in any cell indicates that
regardless of whether a use is allowed by right, or as a special use, temporary
use, or accessory use, additional standards may be applicable to the use. Refer
to Chapter 10, Article 12 of this chapter for Specific Use Provisions.
      G.   Uses Not Allowed. An empty cell indicates that the use is not
allowed in the respective zoning district.
   (3)   Classification of New and Unlisted Uses:
      A.   If a proposed use of property is not specifically listed in this
table, the use shall be prohibited unless the Director, upon the request of an
applicant, determines that a proposed use not listed in this table, is
equivalent to a listed permitted or special use. In making the decision, the
Director shall consider the following:
         1.   The impacts on public services and activities associated with the
proposed use are substantially similar to those of 1 or more of the uses listed
in the applicable base districts as allowed.
         2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than 1 or more of the uses listed in the applicable base districts as
allowed.
         3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district
in which the use is proposed to be located.
         4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
         5.   The Director may also use past precedent, case law, and legal
opinion in making the determination.
         6.   When considering a use not listed in the table, the Director
shall also determine whether additional use-specific standards are necessary.
      B.   If the Director denies an application for such a requested use, the
applicant shall have the right, within the period of ten (10) days from the
date of such disapproval, to appeal the Director’s decision to the City
Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (4)   Mix of Uses/ Buildings:
      A.   RS-1, RS-2, and R-1 Zones: In RS-1, RS-2, and R-1, only one
principal structure or building may be built upon a single parcel or lot,
except as it may be otherwise specified in this article and/or as part of a
planned unit development.
      B.   R-2 and R-3 Zone:
         1.   More than one classification of uses and more than one use within
these use classifications shall be permitted on a lot or parcel without a
planned unit development application, provided the proposed individual uses are
permitted uses or special uses.
         2.   More than one principal structure or building, without having a
planned unit development, are allowed upon a single development site, with the
exception of a site utilized for or containing a single-family residence.
         3.   In the case of a proposed special use, such application should
proceed through the standard procedures of a special use permit application.
      C.   Residential uses are prohibited along the frontage of all arterial
roadways and highways within the Mixed-Use or Community Center place types, as
designated on the Future Land Use Map, unless part of a Mixed-Use Small-Scale
or Mixed-Use Large-Scale building in compliance with section
10-12-03-25.

10-05-04: BULK AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS:
This section contains the requirements for lot size and coverage, scale and
massing, and setbacks for all types of development. These standards may be
further limited or modified by other applicable sections of this chapter. Some
uses are subject to use-specific standards or overlay district requirements
that impose stricter requirements than set forth in this subsection.
   (1)   Setback Reduction: The minimum setback provisions may be reduced with
a Director’s administrative determination in accordance with Section
10-01-02-3, a variance approval, or a planned unit development approval,
whichever may be most applicable.
   (2)   New Construction: All new construction shall comply with the current
dimensional standard schedule in effect at the time the building permit was
filed, excluding alternative setback, height, and/or area schedule requirements
as approved through a planned unit development, Development Agreement, or other
Planning application.
   (3)   Setback Measurements: Regardless of the noted setbacks in each
section, in no case shall new construction be placed within any public right-
of-way or utility easement unless express permission has been granted by the
applicable agency/jurisdiction.
      A.   For new construction, all setbacks are measured from the property
line. When the property is constrained, an approval to modify this measurement
location may be granted by the Director after the submission of a Minor -
Administrative Determination application.
      B.   For additions to existing single-family residential structures,
front and street side yard setbacks may be measured from the back of sidewalk
or anticipated sidewalk location where no sidewalk currently exists, when the
property is constrained, and an approval is granted by the Director after the
submission of a Minor - Administrative Determination application.
      C.   All other setbacks are the distance between a building’s outermost
edge of the outermost foundation wall and the lot/property line.
   (4)   Projections:
      A.   Cornices, canopies, eaves, porches, covered patios, or other
projections which do not increase the volume of space enclosed by the building
may project into any required side yard by no more than two feet (2') and in no
case shall be closer than 3 feet from the side property line. Projections may
encroach a maximum of five feet (5') into any required rear yard setback. Said
encroachment shall be measured from the far edge of the projection, not the
footing, post, or similar.
      B.   Unenclosed porches may extend into the front setback area provided a
minimum setback of fifteen feet (15') from the back of sidewalk, or anticipated
sidewalk location where no sidewalk currently exists, is maintained. If the
living area setback is fifteen feet (15') or less, unenclosed porches may not
project into the front setback and shall comply with the living area setback
outlined in the applicable dimension table.
      C.   Exterior steps or stairs shall not project into required side yards.
      D.   No part of the building whatsoever, including cornices, canopies,
eaves, foundations, footings, air conditioning units, etc., shall extend into
any recorded or nonrecorded easement or easement area, nor any existing or
future right-of-way or right-of-way area unless the utility or agency having
jurisdiction over the easement or right-of-way has given written permission for
such projection to take place.
      E.   Should a structure be found to be in nonconformance with this
article, the following shall apply:
         1.   Structure shall be removed by and at the property owner’s expense
within five (5) days of a request by the City or utility to remove said
structure.
         2.   Structure can be removed by the City or utility after the five
(5) day deadline has expired, without the property owner’s permission and
without compensation to the property owner, and with or without notification,
as necessary for utility or right-of-way maintenance/improvements for any
existing or future public right-of-way areas or easements. Furthermore, City or
utility shall not be responsible for any damage caused to structure during the
process of removal.
         3.   Property owners shall sign and have notarized a statement
prepared by the City acknowledging the above items.
   (5)   Dimensional Standards Table: The allowances set forth below are
applicable to all residential zoning districts. All minimum standards shall be
met, along with compliance with maximum densities as specified in

Table Footnotes:
1.   Projects within the RS-1 and RS-2 zoning districts that meet the
available Conservation Area Development criteria may utilize the R-1 setbacks
for the buildable residential lots. Buildable residential lots may also be
reduced in size, provided they are a minimum of 6,000 sq. ft. in area, have a
minimum of 50 feet of frontage, and structures do not exceed 30 feet in
height.
2.   Single family attached in the R-1 and R-2 zones, may utilize the R-
3 minimum lot sizes and frontage standards but must adhere to the base zoning
height requirements..
3.   Minimum lot frontage for lots on cul-de-sacs or roadways with a radius
curve shall be measured with a chord measurement of the front property line.
4.   Regardless of the zoning district, if a new mixed-use, multi-family, or
non-residential structure is being built immediately adjacent to a single-
family residence, the maximum height of the new structure shall be 30' unless
allowed to exceed such maximum height by special use permit approval. For the
purposes of this section, immediately adjacent to shall mean within one
hundred fifty (150) feet, as measured from structure to structure.
5.   Zero-foot (0') interior setback is permitted for Dwelling-Townhouse
(single-family attached) land uses only. In all other cases, the noted setback
shall be required.
6.   Street side yard garages for residential uses must meet the required
front yard, garage setback.
7.   Public land uses outlined in the applicable land use schedule located in
zoning districts other than the P-D (public) zone shall be permitted to
utilize the same height, setback, and area requirements as permitted in the P-
D (public) zone.

(Ord. 3664, 4-21-2025)
10-05-06: DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS:
Different development options are offered in R districts to accommodate a
variety of community and lifestyle choices. The options described in this
section may be used at the property owner’s election.
   (1)   Standard Conventional Development: “Standard Conventional development”
is any development that is not part of an approved density bonus program,
conservation development, planned unit development or master planned community.
All regulations and provisions of the code are applicable
   (2)   Density Bonus Program Development:
      A.   The density bonus program development option is applicable only
within the R-2 and R-3 zoning designations. It offers additional density if a
project meets certain criteria. The density bonus program standardizes how
additional density is awarded and creates standards that are more evenly
enforced throughout the city. The program addresses unique goals and desired
development types in different parts of the city.
      B.   Property owners may select which components are most relevant to
their project in order to achieve a certain level of density increase. Density
increases are given based on a scoring matrix in accordance with Section
10-03-18 of this chapter.
   (3)   Conservation Area Development:
      A.   The conservation area development option is applicable only within
the RS-1 and RS-2 zones. It allows for an increase up to 3 du/ac in exchange
for the preservation of open space and agriculture. Development with a
recorded, deed-restricted conservation area may create a consolidation of
residential development on one portion of the property in order to preserve
open space. Conservation area development shall be in accordance with
10-05-07-1 (2) of this section. (Ord. 3664, 4-21-2025)
10-05-07: SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
10-05-07-1: RS-1 AND RS- ZONES:
   (1)   General Regulations:
      A.   All development shall preserve the site’s natural and environmental
features, preserving wherever possible, the natural topography, drainage, and
rare native plant species.
      B.   All developments shall incorporate the use of open spaces, including
pastures or other agricultural fields, and wildlife corridors to create well
defined edges to each neighborhood.
      C.   Preservation Of Vistas: Where the land has a suitable slope from
which there are long range views, building structure and arrangement shall
preserve various vistas for all parts of the development and for adjoining
land.
      D.   Building Placement: Buildings set far from roadways and from each
other, unless part of a cluster development in accordance with subsection (2)
below.
   (2)   Conservation Area Development:
      A.   A minimum of 40% of the overall acreage shall be preserved within a
deed restriction recorded against the property. A conservation area may allow
natural environment preservation or continued agricultural production, but the
area shall remain undeveloped.
      B.   The maximum permitted density for the entire parcel, including the
conservation area, may be clustered on the remaining portion of the land.
      C.   In cluster development, views of housing lots from exterior road and
abutting properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography,
existing vegetation, or additional landscaping.
      D.   House lots shall be accessed from interior streets rather than from
roads bordering the land.
      E.   Projects shall be designed to minimize the extent of public
infrastructure needed to service the development or in such a way that the
conservation area is closest to the more rural areas.
      F.   Project shall be designed to protect viewsheds, buffer agricultural
uses from residential development, or facilitate connectivity between
agricultural or conservation areas.
      G.   If part of a final plat, the conservation area shall be noted on the
recorded final plat. Where the development is not subdivided through the
subdivision platting process, a deed restriction shall be recorded against all
lots or parcels part of the conservation area to prevent any future development
of the land. (Ord. 3664, 4-21-2025)
10-05-07-2: DWELLING - TWO-FAMILY (DUPLEX) STANDARDS:
   (1)   The following design standards shall be required with any Dwelling -
Two-Family Duplex residential structure:
      A.   A minimum fifteen (15) foot landscape buffer shall be installed
along the perimeter of any development or subdivision that contains more than
three (3) two-family duplex residential structures when directly adjacent to
any single-family detached dwellings. This buffer shall be landscaped per the
buffer standards in
10-02-09-6, Buffers Between Different Land Uses.
      B.   A minimum of one (1) distinct primary material and color shall be
used with a minimum of one (1) distinct accent material/color; said accent
color shall be different than the primary color.
      C.   Unfinished or colored ordinary smooth face block, untextured
concrete panels, and prefabricated steel panels (i.e. non-insulated metal
siding) are prohibited as primary materials but may be used as accent
materials.
      D.   Smooth vinyl siding is prohibited; textured vinyl siding (fiber
cement board, Hardie-board, etc., or similar) is permitted provided it does not
include a blank wall segment of more than 300 square feet on any elevation. A
mix of material patterns is encouraged when textured vinyl siding is utilized,
including, but not limited to: board and batten, horizontal and vertical lap,
shake, or shingles.
      E.   Physically heavier and more robust materials such as concrete,
masonry, stone, or similar materials are encouraged along all street facing
elevations.
      F.   If multi-story, an accent material or other architectural element
shall be utilized to delineate between each floor.
      G.   At least one type of modulation is required on any façade plane that
is visible from a public street or public space. Qualifying modulation includes
projections, recesses, and step backs that break up building mass. Modulation
shall be a minimum width and depth of one (1) foot and encompass at least 25%
of the façade area.
      H.   Any combination of material, color, modulation, or other
articulation shall be used to delineate and break up wall planes greater than
three hundred (300) square feet in area and/or between each dwelling unit.

   (3)   District Purpose Statements:
      A.   C-1 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodate small-
scale, low-intensity retail, restaurant, office, and service-oriented
businesses that serve the day-to-day needs of nearby residential neighborhoods.
      B.   C-2 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodate
businesses which provide convenient goods and services to a daytime work
population as well as the residents of surrounding neighborhoods.
      C.   C-3 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodates a wide
variety of retail, personal service, office, restaurant, and other commercial
service uses, primarily within and along Caldwell’s major corridors that
primarily serve the city and the region.
      D.   C-4 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan where activities of a
commercial service nature are carried out. Uses within this zone may be more
intensive in character than in other commercial zones and may include some
semi-industrial uses.
      E.   H-C ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodates more
intense commercial activity serving the commercial needs of the city of
Caldwell and the region than what may be provided within the C-3 zone. This
zone would allow for a heterogeneous mix of uses, including major retail
centers, large-scale office parks, medical centers, wholesale businesses, and
highway oriented commercial businesses. Uses within this zone are intended to
be more mixed-use in nature and have frontage or access off of major arterial
or collector roadways. (Ord. 3665, 4-21-2025)
10-06-03: USES:
   (1)   Purpose: This section sets forth the permitted and specially permitted
uses Caldwell’s commercial zoning districts. For Overlay Zoning Districts, see
Chapter 10, Article 11.
   (2)   Explanation and Key to Land Use Table Abbreviations:

by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      B.   Administrative Development Review (ADR): An “ADR” in a cell
indicates the use is allowed by right but requires the submission of an
Administrative Review application and the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance prior to submission of building permits and the commencement of any
construction. In addition, all land uses allowed by right in which a building
permit is not required will require the submission of an Administrative
Development Review (ADR) application to allow for the review of the land use,
site plan, parking, landscaping and compliance with all other applicable city
code regulations and laws.
      C.   Special Use Permit (SUP). A “SUP” in a cell indicates that the use
is allowed in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a
special use, by the commission or hearing examiner in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of this chapter. A “SUP/C” in a cell indicates
that the use is allowed in the respective zoning district only after it has
been reviewed and approved by the City Council.
         1.   Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter.
         2.   The “SUP” or “SUP/C” designation in a given district does not
constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be permitted.
Rather, each special use permit application shall be evaluated as to its
probable effect on adjacent properties and surrounding areas, among other
factors, and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied pursuant to
the procedures in Section
10-03-04, Special Use Permits.
      D.   Uses Accessory to the Principal Use (A). An “A” in a cell indicates
the land use is permitted only as an accessory land use to an approved
principal use only.
      E.   Temporary Use Only (TUP). A “TUP” in any cell indicates that the use
is only permitted as a temporary use only. Temporary use permits may be
required in accordance with Section
10-12-03-34.
      F.   Specific Use Provisions (*). A “*” in any cell indicates that

      D.   Uses Not Allowed. An empty cell indicates that the use is not
allowed in the respective zoning district, unless otherwise specified elsewhere
in this chapter.
   (3)   Classification of New and Unlisted Uses:
      A.   If a proposed use of property is not specifically listed in this
table, the use shall be prohibited unless the Director, upon the request of an
applicant, determines that a proposed use not listed in this table, is
equivalent to a listed permitted or special use. In making the decision, the
Director shall consider the following:
         1.   The impacts on public services and activities associated with the
proposed use are substantially similar to those of 1 or more of the uses listed
in the applicable base districts as allowed;
         2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than 1 or more of the uses listed in the applicable base districts as
allowed;
         3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district
in which the use is proposed to be located; and
         4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
         5.   The Director may also use past precedent, case law, and legal
opinion in making the determination.
         6.   When considering a use that is not listed in the use table, the
Director shall also determine whether additional use-specific standards are
necessary.
      If the Director denies an application for such a requested use, the
applicant shall have the right, within the period of ten (10) days from the
date of such disapproval, to appeal the Director’s decision to the City
Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (4)   Mix of Uses:
      A.   More than one classification of uses and more than one use within
these use classifications shall be permitted on a lot or parcel in the
commercial districts without a planned unit development application, if the
proposed individual uses are permitted uses or special uses, unless otherwise
specified within the specific use provisions for a mixed-use development.
      B.   More than one principal structure or building, without having a
planned unit development, are allowed upon a single development site, with the
exception of a site utilized for or containing single family residential.

proceed through the standard procedures of a special use permit application.
      D.   Residential uses are prohibited along the frontage of all arterial
roadways and highways within the Mixed-Use or Community Center place types, as
designated on the Future Land Use Map, unless part of a Mixed-Use Small-Scale
or Mixed-Use Large-Scale building in compliance with section
10-12-03-25.

10-06-06: DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS:
Different development options are offered in commercial districts where
residential is permitted, to accommodate a variety of community and lifestyle
choices. The options described in this section may be used at the property
owner’s election.

      A.   The density bonus program development option is applicable when a
mixed-use project with residential is proposed with an H-C zoning designation.
It offers additional density if a project meets certain criteria. The density
bonus program standardizes how additional density is awarded and creates
standards that are more evenly enforced throughout the city. The program
addresses unique goals and desired development types in different parts of the
city.
      B.   Property owners may select which components are most relevant to
their project in order to achieve a certain level of density increase. Density
increases are given based on a scoring matrix in accordance with Section

zoning districts established in this chapter, unless specifically stated
otherwise in a specific article in this chapter. (Ord. 3666, 4-21-2025)
10-07-02: DISTRICTS:
   (1)   Intent: Caldwell’s manufacturing and industrial (M) zoning districts
are primarily intended to provide locations for existing and future
manufacturing and industrial uses, and that are better suited for locations
outside of the more densely populated areas of Caldwell due to site
requirements, noise impacts, logistical needs, and other considerations. The
intent of the manufacturing and industrial zones is to allow manufacturing,
warehousing, wholesale, research and development facilities, industrial,
assembly and distribution, and essential public facilities. A broader range of
commercial uses that function efficiently and harmoniously within the zone are
allowed. Office and other secondary may be limited to those that support these
primary uses. Other accessory supporting uses may be considered. Residential
uses are not allowed.
   (2)   District Map Symbol / Names: The city’s manufacturing and industrial
zoning districts are listed below. Changes have been made to the district’s
name, which has no impact on current land use entitlements or property rights.
      When this zoning and development code refers to “manufacturing and
industrial” zoning districts or “M” districts, it is referring to these
districts.

   (3)   District Purpose Statements:
      A.   M-1 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to designate areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan for wholesaling and
distributing activities, genera manufacturing, warehouses, research and
development centers, processing and assembly-type manufacturing and other
similar industrial uses. Processing or fabrication will be limited to
activities conducted within a building that does not emit fumes, odor, dust,
smoke or gas beyond the confines of the building within which the activities
occur or produce significant levels of noise or vibration. Commercial uses
which have been deemed to function efficiently and harmoniously with industrial
uses in this zone may be permitted in accordance with this chapter.
      B.   M-2 ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to designate areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that are suitable for
heavy manufacturing and industrial uses which have the greatest potential for
producing undesirable or adverse by-products, including traffic, noise, odors,
dust and vibrations. The M-2 district should be located in places substantially
removed from residential areas.
      C.   I-P ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodates a wide
variety of manufacturing, distribution, light processing, office buildings,
warehouse retail and related commercial support facilities. This zone is
intended to promote efficient and economical land use, an improved level of
amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety in physical development, creative
design, improved industrial and commercial environments, and the protection of
adjacent and nearby existing and future city development. (Ord. 3666, 4-21-

by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      B.   Administrative Development Review (ADR): An “ADR” in a cell
indicates the use is allowed by right but requires the submission of an
Administrative Review application and the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance prior to submission of building permits and the commencement of any
construction. In addition, all land uses allowed by right in which a building
permit is not required will require the submission of an Administrative
Development Review (ADR) application to allow for the review of the land use,
site plan, parking, landscaping and compliance with all other applicable city
code regulations and laws.
      C.   Special Use Permit (SUP). A “SUP” in a cell indicates that the use
is allowed in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a
special use, by the commission or hearing examiner in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of this chapter. A “SUP/C” in a cell indicates
that the use is allowed in the respective zoning district only after it has
been reviewed and approved by the City Council.
         1.   Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter.
         2.   The “SUP” or “SUP/C” designation in a given district does not
constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be permitted.
Rather, each special use permit application shall be evaluated as to its
probable effect on adjacent properties and surrounding areas, among other
factors, and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied pursuant to
the procedures in Section
10-03-04, Special Use Permits.
      D.   Uses Accessory to the Principal Use (A). An “A” in a cell indicates
the land use is permitted only as an accessory land use to an approved
principal use only.
      E.   Temporary Use Only (TUP). A “TUP” in any cell indicates that the use
is only permitted as a temporary use only. Temporary use permits may be
required in accordance with Section
10-12-03-34.
      F.   Specific Use Provisions (*). A “*” in any cell indicates that

use, or accessory use, additional standards may be applicable to the use. Refer
to Chapter 10, Article 12 of this chapter for Specific Use Provisions.
      D.   Uses Not Allowed. An empty cell indicates that the use is not
allowed in the respective zoning district.
   (3)   Classification of New and Unlisted Uses:
      A.   If a proposed use of property is not specifically listed in this
table, the use shall be prohibited unless the Director, upon the request of an
applicant, determines that a proposed use not listed in this table, is
equivalent to a listed permitted or special use. In making the decision, the
Director shall consider the following:
         1.   The impacts on public services and activities associated with the
proposed use are substantially similar to those of 1 or more of the uses listed
in the applicable base districts as allowed;
         2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than 1 or more of the uses listed in the applicable base districts as
allowed;
         3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district
in which the use is proposed to be located; and
         4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
         5.   The Director may also use past precedent, case law, and legal
opinion in making the determination.
         6.   When considering a use not listed in the use table, the Director
shall also determine whether additional use-specific standards are necessary.
      If the Director denies an application for such a requested use, the
applicant shall have the right, within the period of ten (10) days from the
date of such disapproval, to appeal the Director’s decision to the City
Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final.?
   (4)   Mix of Uses:
      A.   More than one classification of uses and more than one use within
these use classifications shall be permitted on a lot or parcel within the same
building, without a planned unit development application approval, if the
proposed individual uses are permitted uses or special uses, except for a lot
or parcel utilized for or containing single family residential.
      B.   In the manufacturing and industrial zones, more than one principal
structure or building may be built upon a single parcel or lot, except for a
lot or parcel utilized for or containing single family residential.
      C.   In the case of a proposed special use, such application should
proceed through the standard procedures of a special use permit application.

permit was filed, excluding alternative setback, height, and/or area schedule
requirements as approved through a planned unit development, Development
Agreement, or other Planning application.
   (3)   Setback Measurements: All setbacks shall be measured from the lot /
property lines. Regardless of the noted setbacks in each section, in no case

(5) day deadline has expired, without the property owner’s permission and
without compensation to the property owner, and with or without notification,
as necessary for utility or right-of-way maintenance/improvements for any
existing or future public right-of-way areas or easements. Furthermore, City or
utility shall not be responsible for any damage caused to structure during the
process of removal;
         3.   Property owners shall sign and have notarized a statement

   (1)   Applicability: The zoning district regulations and standards
established in this section shall apply to all districts established in this
section, unless specifically stated otherwise in a specific article in this
chapter. (Ord. 3667, 4-21-2025)
10-08-02: DISTRICTS:
   (1)   Intent: Caldwell’s urban core zoning districts are primarily intended
to:
      A.   Provide for and encourage a mix of complimentary residential and
non-residential land uses to take place in a variety of forms which are usually
categorized as one of three types: vertical mixed-use, horizontal mixed-use and
mixed-use walkable.
      B.    Create economic and social vitality and reduce vehicle miles
traveled.
      C.   Develop commercial and mixed-use areas that are safe, comfortable,
and attractive to pedestrians.
      D.   Provide flexibility in the location and design of new developments
and redevelopment to anticipate changes in the market.
      E.   Reinforce streets as public places that encourage pedestrian and
bicycle travel.
      F.   Provide roadway and pedestrian connections to residential areas.
      G.   Provide transitions between high traffic streets and neighborhoods.
      H.   Encourage efficient land use by facilitating compact, high-density
development and minimizing the amount of land that is needed for surface
parking.
      I.   Facilitate development (land use mix, density and design) that
supports public transit, where applicable.
      J.   Encourage adaptive reuses of buildings.
   (2)   District Map Symbol / Names: The city’s urban core zoning districts
are listed below. Changes have been made to the zoning district names, which
has no impact on current land use entitlements or property rights.
      When this zoning and development code refers to “urban core” zoning
districts or “D-CC”, “D-CB”, or “T-N” districts, it refers to these districts.

   (3)   District Purpose Statements:
      A.   D-CC ZONE: The Downtown City Center (D-CC) district is the heart of
downtown, providing opportunities for infill and redevelopment, while retaining
the traditional “Main Street” character. The district is intended to provide
areas by zoning procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that
accommodates a broad mix of pedestrian-oriented active uses such as retail
shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, as well as urban residential
units and visitor lodging, to promote a lively street environment and expanded
hours of activity. Vertical mixed-use development projects will have active
uses on the first floor, with office users or urban residential units on the
upper floors. Where the upper floors contain a mix of office and residential,
the office uses shall be on the lower floors, with the residential uses above.
A pedestrian-friendly environment is encouraged in this district, with
buildings located near the front sidewalk and parking located to the side or
rear.
      B.   D-CB ZONE: The Downtown Central Business (D-CB) district provides
for more urban-intensity mixed-use development in areas of Downtown that
contain larger tracts of vacant or underutilized land. It is intended to
provide areas by zoning procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan
that provides opportunities for concentrations of convention space, public and
semi-public governmental offices, hotels, urban residential and similar uses
that typically have more intensive land requirements or need larger parcels of
land than could be readily accommodated in other areas of Downtown. The outside
boundaries of the central business district, serves as a buffer area, providing
a gradual transition between the urban dense patterns of development desired in
other locations of Downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods. New buildings
should provide amenities for adjacent neighborhoods and enhance the appearance
of gateways downtown. A broad range of uses is permitted in this district
provided the design of the uses is compatible with the established character of
the area.
      C.   T-N ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that provides areas for
residential, mixed-use, cottage industries, adaptive reuse, and small-scale
retail, office and service uses. This zone generally abuts or serves as a
transitional zone between the more intense mixed-use center of downtown and
other surrounding neighborhoods. Development patterns usually include small
lots, in a compact development form within a non-automobile-depending
environment. (Ord. 3667, 4-21-2025)
10-08-03: USES:
   (1)   Purpose: This section sets forth the permitted and specially permitted
uses Caldwell’s urban core zoning districts. For Overlay Zoning Districts, see
Chapter 10, Article 11.
   (2)   Explanation and Key to Land Use Table Abbreviations:
      A.   Permitted Uses (P): A “P” in a cell indicates that a use is allowed
by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      B.   Administrative Development Review (ADR): An “ADR” in a cell
indicates the use is allowed by right but requires the submission of an
Administrative Review application and the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance prior to submission of building permits and the commencement of any
construction. In addition, all land uses allowed by right in which a building
permit is not required will require the submission of an Administrative
Development Review (ADR) application to allow for the review of the land use,
site plan, parking, landscaping and compliance with all other applicable city
code regulations and laws.
      C.   Special Use Permit (SUP). A “SUP” in a cell indicates that the use
is allowed in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a
special use, by the commission or hearing examiner in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of this chapter. A “SUP/C” in a cell indicates
that the use is allowed in the respective zoning district only after it has
been reviewed and approved by the City Council.
         1.   Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter.
         2.   The “SUP” or “SUP/C” designation in a given district does not
constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be permitted.
Rather, each special use permit application shall be evaluated as to its
probable effect on adjacent properties and surrounding areas, among other
factors, and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied pursuant to
the procedures in Section
10-03-04, Special Use Permits.
      D.   Uses Accessory to the Principal Use (A). An “A” in a cell indicates
the land use is permitted only as an accessory land use to an approved
principal use only.
      E.   Temporary Use Only (TUP). A “TUP” in any cell indicates that the use
is only permitted as a temporary use only. Temporary use permits may be
required in accordance with Section
10-12-03-34.
      F.   Specific Use Provisions (*). A “*” in any cell indicates that
regardless of whether a use is allowed by right, or as a special use, temporary
use, or accessory use, additional standards may be applicable to the use. Refer
to Chapter 10, Article 12 of this chapter for Specific Use Provisions.
      G.   Uses Not Allowed. An empty cell indicates that the use is not
allowed in the respective zoning district.
   (3)   Classification of New and Unlisted Uses:
      A.   If a proposed use of property is not specifically listed in this
table, the use shall be prohibited unless the Director, upon the request of an
applicant, determines that a proposed use not listed in this table, is
equivalent to a listed permitted or special use. In making the decision, the
Director shall consider the following:
         1.   The impacts on public services and activities associated with the
proposed use are substantially similar to those of 1 or more of the uses listed
in the applicable base districts as allowed.
         2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than 1 or more of the uses listed in the applicable base districts as
allowed.
         3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district
in which the use is proposed to be located.
         4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
         5.   The proposed use is not similar to a use that is specifically
listed as prohibited.
         6.   The Director may also use past precedent, case law, and legal
opinion in making the determination.
         7.   When considering a use not listed within the table, the Director
shall also determine whether additional use-specific standards are necessary.
      B.   If the Director denies an application for such a requested use, the
applicant shall have the right, within the period of ten (10) days from the
date of such disapproval, to appeal the Director’s decision to the City
Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (4)   Mix of Uses / Buildings:
      A.   More than one classification of uses and more than one use within
these use classifications shall be permitted on a lot or parcel in the urban
core districts without a planned unit development application approval, if the
proposed individual uses are permitted uses or special uses, or as otherwise
provided within the mixed-use special use provisions.
      B.   More than one principal structure or building, without having a
planned unit development, are allowed upon a single development site, with the
exception of a site utilized for or containing single family residential,
unless otherwise permitted by this Article.
   (5)   Land Use Schedule:
      A.   The following is a list of allowed land uses within the urban core
zones.
      B.   Some uses shown within the table below may be prohibited based on a
specific overlay zone. Refer to Section
10-11-07: Special Development and Urban Design Overlay Districts for prohibited
uses.
      C.   Where a conflict exists between this schedule and the overlay
district prohibitions, the more restrictive shall govern.

10-08-04: BULK AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS:
This section contains the requirements for lot size and coverage, scale and
massing, and setbacks for all types of development. These standards may be
further limited or modified by other applicable sections of this chapter. Some
uses and/or zoning districts are subject to use-specific standards, design and
development standards, or overlay district requirements that impose stricter
requirements than set forth in this subsection.
   (1)   Setback Reduction: The minimum setback yard provisions may be reduced
with a Director’s administrative determination in accordance with Section
10-01-02-3, a variance approval, or a planned unit development approval,
whichever may be most applicable.
   (2)   New Construction: All new construction shall comply with the current
dimensional standard schedule in effect at the time the building permit was
filed, excluding alternative setback, height, and/or area schedule requirements
as approved through a planned unit development, Development Agreement, or other
Planning application.
   (3)   Setback Measurements: Regardless of the noted setbacks in each
section, in no case shall new construction be placed within any public right-
of-way or utility easement unless express permission has been granted by the
applicable agency/jurisdiction.
      A.   For new construction, all setbacks are measured from the property
line.
      B.   For additions to existing single family residential structures,
front and street side yard setbacks may be measured from the back of sidewalk
or anticipated sidewalk location where no sidewalk currently exists, when the
property is constrained, and an approval is granted by the Director after the
submission of a Minor- Administrative Determination application.
      C.   All other setbacks are the distance between a building’s outermost
edge of the outermost foundation wall and the lot/property line.
   (4)   Stricter Standards and Provisions Govern: If the site and building
design and development standards specific to a zone are stricter than the
provisions listed in this section, the more restrictive shall govern.

features, and the like.
2   A setback of 20' is required for any non-residential structure or building
adjacent to a residential zoning district.
3   There are no minimum or maximum side yard, street side, or rear yard
setback requirements, except for all structures shall conform to the vision
triangle standards set forth in section
10-07-07 of this chapter and the applicable fire and building code requirements
for attached structures, firewalls, and related requirements.
4   Regardless of the zoning district, if a new mixed-use, multi-family, or
non-residential structure is being built immediately adjacent to a single-
family residence, the maximum height of the new structure shall be 30' unless
allowed to exceed such maximum height by special use permit approval. For the
purposes of this section, immediately adjacent to shall mean within one hundred
fifty (150) feet, as measured from structure to structure.
5   There is no maximum building height for all structures located within the
“downtown area” which is defined as the area bordered on the north by the
railroad tracks, on the south by Dearborn Street, on the west by Fourth Avenue
and on the east by Twelfth Avenue.

   (6)   Encroachments:
      A.   Chimneys, overhangs, cornices, eaves, bay windows, porches,
canopies, balconies, platforms, covered patios, or other similar architectural
projections, may encroach into any setback, easement or right of way by no more
than four feet (4'), subject to compliance with applicable standards of the
fire and building code and provided any such encroachments are a minimum of
fourteen feet six inches (14'6") above sidewalk or street/alley grade.
      B.   Public spaces may encroach into the setbacks from Indian Creek.
      C.   No encroachments of any type are allowed in, on or over any easement
(s), except that such encroachments may be allowed with written permission from
any affected utility or agency having jurisdiction over the easement and with a
signed and notarized statement, as prepared by the city, from the property
owner acknowledging that: structure shall be removed by and at the property
owner’s expense within five (5) days of a request by the city or utility to
remove said structure; structure can be removed by the city or utility after
the five (5) day deadline has expired, without the property owner’s permission
and without compensation to the property owner, and with or without
notification, as necessary for utility or right of way maintenance/improvements
for any existing or future public right of way areas or easements; and the city
and/or utility and/or agency having jurisdiction over the easement shall not be
held liable or responsible for any damages to or replacement costs for said
structure.
      D.   Downtown Districts: If used, arcades, galleries, colonnades and
awnings, and the like may encroach into the public right of way to within
twenty- four inches (24") to thirty inches (30") of the curb face if a street
or completely to the far edge of the alley if an alley. All such encroachments
must be a minimum of fourteen feet six inches (14'6") above sidewalk grade or
alley grade, whichever is applicable.
      E.   Balconies, bay windows, eaves, cornices, overhangs, and cantilevered
rooms on upper floors may encroach into the public right of way to within
twenty-four (24) to thirty inches (30") of the curb face.
      F.   All public right of way encroachments shall be a minimum of fourteen
feet six inches (14'6") above sidewalk grade.
      G.   Vision Triangle: There shall be nothing that shall interfere with
the vision triangle standards set forth in section
10-07-07 of this chapter.
      H.   Placement Of Nonpermanent Items: The placement of nonpermanent
items, such as chairs and tables, in alleys and right-of-way on a temporary or
seasonal basis, shall be regulated by section

10-09-02: DISTRICTS:
   (1)   Intent: Caldwell’s special purpose zoning districts are primarily
intended to accommodate public, quasi-public and institutional uses such as
colleges, universities, vocational educational facilities, healthcare
institutions, government facilities, airports, and similar uses, and allow for
their expansion in a planned manner while protecting the surrounding
neighborhoods. The districts are meant to be flexible to allow for supporting
uses and ancillary uses that serve the principal uses.

districts are listed below. Changes have been made to the H-D district name,
which has no impact on a property owners current land use entitlements or
property rights.
      When this zoning and development code refers to “institutional and public
districts”, “airport district”, “college district”, “hospital/healthcare
district” or “public district”, or to “A-D”, “C-D”, “H-D” or “P-D” districts,

   (3)   District Purpose Statements:
      A.   A-D ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that creates an
environment for developing the facilities necessary or desirable for the safe,
efficient, convenient and economical operation of the Caldwell Executive

manufacturing, industrial and commercial uses that provide support for airport
operations and services to airport users, while protecting the public interest
and investment.
      B.   C-D ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedures in accordance with the comprehensive plan that create, preserve and
enhance areas adjacent to college education facilities by allowing for
residential, commercial, industrial, and related establishments that compliment
and support the college facilities. Uses are to be restricted to those
primarily required by educational users and providers including, but not
limited to teaching, housing, research, libraries, athletic recreation and
competitions, public gathering facilities, performing arts, general shopping
and retail, healthcare, research activities, and complementary uses appropriate
to the zone.
      C.   H-D ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedure in accordance with the comprehensive plan that provide health,
medical, and related services at major medical institutions in the city and in
the immediate area surrounding such institutions. Hospital and healthcare
campuses are primary users within this zone with medical and healthcare
supportive land uses as ancillary uses.
      D.   P-D ZONE: The purpose of this zone is to provide areas by zoning
procedure in accordance with the comprehensive plan that accommodates public
and quasi-public land uses. The intent of this zoning category is to allow for
necessary civic uses in the community, such as public schools, post offices,
public (federal, state, city and county) buildings, parks and recreation
facilities, public open space, public utility yards and similar uses. (Ord.

   (2)   Explanation and Key to Land Use Table Abbreviations:

by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      B.   Administrative Development Review (ADR): An “ADR” in a cell
indicates the use is allowed by right but requires the submission of an
Administrative Review application and the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance prior to submission of building permits and the commencement of any
construction. In addition, all land uses allowed by right in which a building
permit is not required will require the submission of an Administrative
Development Review (ADR) application to allow for the review of the land use,
site plan, parking, landscaping and compliance with all other applicable city
code regulations and laws.
      C.   Special Use Permit (SUP). A “SUP” in a cell indicates that the use
is allowed in the respective zoning district only if reviewed and approved as a
special use, by the commission or hearing examiner in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of this chapter. A “SUP/C” in a cell indicates
that the use is allowed in the respective zoning district only after it has
been reviewed and approved by City Council.
         1.   Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of
this chapter.
         2.   The “SUP” or “SUP/C” designation in a given district does not
constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be permitted.
Rather, each special use permit application shall be evaluated as to its
probable effect on adjacent properties and surrounding areas, among other
factors, and may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied pursuant to
the procedures in Section
10-03-04, Special Use Permits.
      D.   Uses Accessory to the Principal Use (A). An “A” in a cell indicates
the land use is permitted only as an accessory land use to an approved
principal use only.
      E.   Temporary Use Only (TUP). A “TUP” in any cell indicates that the use
is only permitted as a temporary use only. Temporary use permits may be
required in accordance with Section
10-12-03-34.
      F.   Specific Use Provisions (*). A “*” in any cell indicates that
regardless of whether a use is allowed by right, or as a special use, temporary
use, or accessory use, additional standards may be applicable to the use. Refer
to Chapter 10, Article 12 of this chapter for Specific Use Provisions.
      G.   Uses Not Allowed. An empty cell indicates that the use is not
allowed in the respective zoning district.
   (3)   Classification of New and Unlisted Uses:
      A.   If a proposed use of property is not specifically listed in this
table, the use shall be prohibited unless the Director, upon the request of an
applicant, determines that a proposed use not listed in this table, is
equivalent to a listed permitted or special use. In making the decision, the
Director shall consider the following:
         1.   The impacts on public services and activities associated with the
proposed use are substantially similar to those of 1 or more of the uses listed
in the applicable base districts as allowed;
         2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than 1 or more of the uses listed in the applicable base districts as
allowed;
         3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district
in which the use is proposed to be located; and
         4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
         5.   The Director may also use past precedent, case law, and legal
opinion in making the determination.
         6.   When considering a use that is not listed in the use table, the
Director shall also determine whether additional use-specific standards are
necessary.
      B.   If the Director denies an application for such a requested use, the
applicant shall have the right, within the period of ten (10) days from the
date of such disapproval, to appeal the Director’s decision to the City
Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
   (4)   Mix of Uses/Buildings:
      A.   More than one classification of uses and more than one use within
these use classifications shall be permitted on a lot or parcel in the special
purpose districts without a planned unit development application approval, if
the proposed individual uses are permitted uses or special uses, unless
otherwise specified within the specific use provisions for a mixed-use
development.
      B.    More than one principal structure or building, without having a
planned unit development, are allowed upon a single development site, with the
exception of a site utilized for or containing single family residential.
      C.   In the case of a proposed special use, such application should
proceed through the standard procedures of a special use permit application.
      D.   Residential uses are prohibited along the frontage of all arterial
roadways and highways within the Mixed-Use or Community Center place types, as
designated on the Future Land Use Map, unless part of a Mixed-Use Small-Scale

10-11-01: SHORT TITLE: ARTICLE PURPOSE, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (1)   Short Title: This article shall be known and may be cited as the
OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (2)   Article Purpose:
      A.   The Overlay Zoning Districts are established to provide additional
or more restrictive requirements for the specific type of overlay area that are
superimposed upon those of the base or underlying zone. Overlay zones address
special land use circumstances or environmental safeguards unique to the
property or its surroundings.
   (3)   General Provisions; All Zones:
      A.   Applicable Standards and Provisions: Properties within an overlay
zone are subject to the requirements and regulations of both the base zone and
the overlay zone. Properties located within multiple overlay zones shall comply
with the requirements for each overlay zone. Where the standards or provisions
of the overlay and base zone are different or in conflict, the more restrictive
standards shall apply.
      B.   In some cases, uses vary from the underlying zoning district and the
overlay zones. Standards of the overlay shall govern.
      C.   Unless otherwise provided, principal and accessory uses in an
overlay district are allowed only to the extent such uses are allowed by the
underlying zoning district and any other applicable overlay district and are in
conformance with all other application regulations of this chapter. Overlay
districts may prohibit land uses that may otherwise be allowed by the
underlying zoning district.
   (4)   Overlay Districts and the Zoning Map: All overlay districts shall be
delineated as an overlay on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Caldwell.
The boundary of the overlay district shall be shown and the short name for the
specific overlay zone shall be listed. (Ord. 3669, 4-21-2025)
10-11-02: AIRPORT IMPACT OVERLAY DISTRICTS:
10-11-02-1: PURPOSE:
The Airport Impact Overlay is established to acknowledge the unique land use
impacts of airports, to contribute to the safe operation of the airport, to
regulate the siting of noise sensitive uses, to ensure that the heights of
structures are compatible with airport operations, to protect the possibility
of future expansion of the airport and to control and minimize impacts on
surrounding activities. It is also the intent of the Airport Impact Overlay to
encourage land use patterns appropriate in the vicinity of the airport for
public health, safety and welfare. Standards are provided to encourage trade
and commerce and thereby maintain economic vitality. (Ord. 3669, 4-21-2025)
10-11-02-2: APPLICABILITY:
This section applies to properties located in the APO-1 Airport Land Use
Limitation Zone and/or the APO-2 Airport Noise Abatement Zone that are: 1)
within the corporate city limits of Caldwell at the effective date of this
article, 2) annexed after the effective date of this article regardless of the
zone designation assigned upon such annexation, or 3) within the current impact
area of the city of Caldwell provided that this article is made effective in
said impact area by the impact area agreement between the city of Caldwell and
Canyon County. The specific boundaries of the APO-1 and APO-2 zones are shown
on the zoning map and described in appendix A as attached to ordinance 2457,
and as may be amended. (Ord. 3669, 4-21-2025)
10-11-02-3: DEFINITIONS:
Definitions shall be in accordance with Section
10-01-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 3669, 4-21-2025)
10-11-02-4: DIVIDED PARCELS:
This section shall apply to all parcels of property lying partially within the
Airport Impact Overlay Zone and partially outside the Airport Impact Overlay
Zone, as well as parcels lying partially within the APO-1 Zone and partially
within the APO-2 Zone. For purposes of this section, the APO-1 Zone shall be
considered more restrictive than the APO-2 Zone, and the APO-2 Zone shall be
considered more restrictive than areas outside the Airport Impact Overlay Zone.
   (1)   If the portion of the divided parcel in the more restrictive zone is
two (2) acres or less, the entire parcel shall be deemed to lie in the less
restrictive zone. Provided, however, that parcels touching a less restrictive
zone by only a driveway, deeded access for ingress/egress, “shoestring” or
other, similar configuration shall be deemed to lie in the more restrictive
zone.
   (2)   If the portion of the divided parcel in the more restrictive zone is
between two (2) and five (5) acres, the zone in which the majority of the
parcel lies shall apply to the whole parcel.
   (3)   If the portion of the divided parcel in the more restrictive zone is
five (5) acres or larger, that portion of the parcel must be developed in
accordance with the more restrictive zone. (Ord. 3669, 4-21-2025)

condition, free from obnoxious odors and substances.
   (2)   All persons who keep or maintain any animals, livestock, pets, and/or
companion animals shall keep them confined at all times to the subject property
in enclosures strong enough to prevent the said animals from entering the
premises or property of another, including sidewalks, streets and alleys unless
accompanied by the animal owner and unless the animal is contained on/with a
leash or similar.
   (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person keeping or maintaining any
animals, livestock, pets, and/or companion animals to allow the same to create
a disturbance to the residents in the particular locality by creating any
noise, odor or damage to the adjacent property, and the keeping and maintaining
of said animals shall not interfere with the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of
such property by such adjacent owners or residents.
   (4)   It shall be unlawful for animal/livestock/pets/companion animal owners
to fail to exercise proper care and control of their animals/livestock/pets/
companion animals to prevent them from becoming a public nuisance.
   (5)   All persons shall be guilty of allowing animals/livestock/pets/
companion animals to become a nuisance when they:
      A.   Consistently emit excessive and continuous noise;
      B.   Harass passersby and/or chase vehicles;
      C.   Habitually attack other animals/livestock/pets/companion animals;
      D.   Trespass upon public or private property; or
      E.   When owners allow excessive accumulation of animal feces and/or
related odor in such a manner as to affect the health and quiet enjoyment of
another person.
   (6)   Livestock:
      A.   Commercial Livestock Use: The raising of livestock for the specific
purpose of selling the livestock or livestock products (such as milk, meat,
eggs, etc.) represents commercial livestock use. Such use requires compliance
with the base standards in this section, approval of a special use permit and
compliance with all conditions placed upon the approved special use permit. The
raising of animals for youth development activities involving 4-H or Future
Farmers Of America (FFA) and the sale of such animals shall not be considered a
commercial use.
      B.   Number Of Livestock Allowed:
         1.   A minimum lot size of one-half (1/2) acre is required to qualify
for the keeping of livestock within the city of Caldwell.
         2.   Property owners are allowed the following maximum number of
animals per one-half (1/2) acre:
Animal Maximum Number Per 1/2 Acre
Animal                    Maximum Number Per 1/2 Acre
Chickens (no roosters)    30
Cows or similar           1
Ducks                     12
Geese                     6
Goats                     4
Horses or similar         1
Llamas or similar         1
Pigeons, doves or similar 30
Rabbits                   30
Sheep                     4
Swine                     4
 
      Note: The number of animals allowed per one-half (1/2) acre is based upon
the size and characteristics of the animal. The planning and zoning department
shall determine the equivalent number of animals allowed for animals not listed
in the above table, including miniature forms of large animals, and shall take
into consideration the purpose of this section and the impacts to adjacent
properties.
      In instances where a mixed livestock density is desired, the number of
types of animals desired shall be divided into the maximum number allowed. For
example, an individual who has one-half (1/2) acre of land wants to have sheep,
goats, swine and ducks which are four (4) different types of animals. The
maximum number of sheep allowed is four (4). Four (4) divided by four (4)
equals one. The maximum number of goats allowed is four (4). Four (4) divided
by four (4) equals one. The maximum number of swine allowed is four (4). Four
(4) divided by four (4) equals one. The maximum number of ducks allowed is
twelve (12). Twelve (12) divided by four (4) equals three (3). Therefore, the
individual could have, as livestock, a combined total of one sheep, one goat,
one swine and three (3) ducks on one-half (1/2) acre of land.
      C.   Standards for Livestock:
         1.   Livestock shall be kept and maintained within enclosures which
may include fences, corrals, barns, pens, etc., or some other structure that
will ensure the livestock cannot ever leave the premises of its own volition.
         2.   Livestock enclosures, regardless of square footage, must meet the
setback requirements of the zoning district within which they are located.
Livestock enclosures at residential dwellings located in commercial or
industrial districts shall meet the setback requirements for the R-3 (high
density residential) zoning district. Livestock enclosures in commercial and
industrial sites that are not residential in use shall also meet the setback
requirements for the R-3 (high density residential) zoning district.
         3.   All fencing shall meet the requirements of the fence ordinance
for the zone in which they are located.
         4.   The maximum number of livestock allowed is listed in the table
above. Maximum animal density does not include offspring born on the property
until said offspring are nine (9) months of age.
         5.   Property owners keeping livestock in accordance with the above
standards must maintain such animals in a manner that does not cause adverse
impact to neighboring properties. Potential negative impacts on adjacent
properties include odors, noise, drainage, erosion, and flies. Individuals who
keep livestock are responsible for the regular removal and disposal of animal
waste, and control of insects, erosion, and odor. Nondomesticated animals such
as raccoons must be kept in fully enclosed structures and shall comply with all
state and federal licensing requirements in addition to the provisions of this
section. Failure to maintain the property in accordance with these requirements
shall be considered a violation of this section.
      D.   Exceptions to minimum lot size:
         1.   Animals classified as livestock within this section may be kept
on less than one-half (1/2) acre for educational purposes, such as 4-H or FFA
if the performance standards listed above are complied with. The specified
maximum animal density allowed for one-half (1/2) acre shall not be exceeded
for such educational uses.

in the numbers prescribed below regardless of the size of the parcel if the
performance standards listed in this section are complied with and no
individual household shall have any more than three (3) different types of
pets:

   (1)   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines and
standards for the construction and placement of all wireless communications
facilities (WCF), towers, and their accessories within the City of Caldwell.
The goal is to minimize all adverse visual and safety effects on the community
by employing collocation innovative design, location, and camouflaging
techniques.
   (2)   Applicability:
      A.   This section shall not govern antennas or towers which are used
exclusively for the transmission of emergency signals.
      B.   Routine maintenance and minor modifications that do not increase the
height of the WCF may be made on preexisting WCFs to allow for collocation,
replacement of antennas, or new antennas. Placement of antennas shall be
considered routine maintenance, so long as the new antenna does not increase
the height of the WCF. All other modifications shall require the WCF to comply
with the provisions of this section.
   (3)   Procedure:
      A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, or replace
any wireless communications facility (WCF) or antenna within the City without
first contacting the city’s Community Development Department to determine the
need for any special use permit (SUP) approvals and associated fees that may or
may not be necessary prior to obtaining any required building or electrical
permits.
      B.   Application: In addition to standard requirements for obtaining a
building permit, all applications for the construction, reconstruction, or
modification of a wireless communication facility are subject to administrative
review and may be subject to a special use permit as determined by the
Director. The application submittal must include the following information:
         1.   Applicant’s name, address, and telephone number.
         2.   Carrier’s name, address, and telephone number.
         3.   Documentation from a licensed and qualified engineer showing that
the proposed facility will meet or exceed all federal communications commission
standards regarding radio frequency emissions and other energy considerations.
         4.   Documentation showing that the proposed facility conforms to all
regulations administered by the federal aviation administration, including
light and height restrictions (See subsection 10 of this section).
         5.   Documentation of the steps the applicant will take to avoid
electromagnetic interference with other communication facilities.
         6.   Written evidence of compliance with all building and electrical
codes.
         7.   For new towers only: All new WCFs must obtain a SUP prior to
obtaining a building permit. In addition to all information required for an SUP
application, WCFs must also include the following:
            (A)   A letter of intent from the owner of the WCF committing the
tower to collocation of additional antennas, as set forth in subsection (4) of
this section, provided the collocator is agreeable to reasonable terms and
conditions for shared use.
            (B)   A report from a qualified and licensed engineer, including
his/her stamp and registration number on all items. The report shall describe
the proposed facility, and include the following information:
               (i)   A description of the WCF height and design to include a
cross section, elevation profile and stabilization method.
               (ii)   The documented height above finished grade for the WCF
and positions of all potential collocated antennas.
               (iii)   Lighting plan, if applicable.
               (iv)   The minimum mounting distances for collocated antennas.
               (v)   The tower’s capacity to accept collocated antennas,
including the number and types of antennas that may be mounted.
               (vi)   Documentation that the WCF is constructed to meet
industry standards, as set forth in subsection (7)H of this section.
               (vii)   Documentation that the WCF and accessory structures will
not produce any adverse noise, as set forth in subsection (7)I of this section.
            (C)   A written analysis, demonstrating that the proposed location
is the most appropriate within the immediate area and the basis for that
determination offered in a narrative format; the analysis shall include:
               (i)   The topography and description of the surrounding area.
               (ii)   Impediments that would obstruct transmissions.
               (iii)   Technical limitations.
            (D)   Proposed or existing roadway access to the WCF.
            (E)   A list of existing WCFs within two (2) miles of the proposed
WCF location (from Canyon County development services) to demonstrate in
writing that collocation is not feasible on the existing WCFs due to any
combination of the following:
               (i)   Existing towers or structures located within the
applicant’s search radius are not sufficient in terms of location, height, or
structural strength.
               (ii)   The proposed collocation of an existing tower or facility
would be in violation of any local, state, or federal law.
               (iii)   The unwillingness of another tower or facility owner to
entertain the shared use.
               (iv)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required to
share or adapt existing WCFs, and structures located within the existing zones
that meet applicant’s needs are unreasonable. For the purposes of this section,
unreasonable costs are those determined to exceed the costs of a new tower
development. Contractual provisions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
               (v)   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna located on the existing WCFs or
the existing antenna would cause interference with the applicant’s proposed
antenna.
               (vi)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that prevent collocation.
      C.   Additional Information Provided: The city may require the applicant
to provide additional information about the WCF or antenna beyond the
information required above. Additionally, the city may retain a qualified
consultant at the applicant’s expense for review purposes.
   (4)   Collocation: Collocation is encouraged for its visually enhancing
attributes and its potential to minimize land use impacts.
      A.   Minor modifications that do not extend the height of the WCF may be
made on preexisting WCFs to allow for collocation.
      B.   Any collocation that increases the height of a WCF shall require an
administrative review as described above and shall be subject to an independent
building code review and permit process.
      C.   The maximum height of new antennas mounted on preexisting structures
in order to accommodate collocation shall not exceed eight feet (8') above the
height of the existing structure, or eight (8) feet above the maximum allowable
height (if there is one) in the underlying zone, whichever height is greater.
      D.   If an antenna is collocated on a public utility, such as a power
pole, the applicant must provide documentation from the utility stating that it
does not object to the collocation.
      E.   An existing utility pole may be replaced with a taller pole to
accommodate collocation, provided that the owner or person who otherwise
controls the pole finds it to be acceptable.
      F.   If the owner or person who otherwise controls a WCF shall fail or
refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise
feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be
considered a nonconforming structure and shall not be altered, expanded, or
extended in any respect, as set forth in section
10-02-08, “Nonconforming Uses”, of this article unless such changes are made to
accommodate additional carriers.
      G.   Antennas may be attached to light standards, power line support
devices, or flagpoles, provided the owner or authority agrees in writing to
such placement. The applicant must provide verification from a qualified and
licensed engineer that the antenna placement will not create safety hazards and
is compatible with the item’s structural integrity.
   (5)   Preexisting WCFs And Antennas:
      A.   A notice of continuing use must be filed with the Caldwell planning
and zoning department by the owner/operator for all WCFs or antennas existing
prior to the effective date hereof, certifying that the structure continues to
be used as a WCF or as an antenna. Failure to file a notice of continuing use
within one year of the effective date hereof and provided the carrier has been
notified sixty (60) days in advance of that notice deficiency shall constitute
abandonment.
      B.   Once a notice of continuing use is filed, the WCF or antenna shall
then be considered a preexisting use and shall be allowed to continue to be
used as it presently exists.
      C.   For the purposes of this subsection, all antennas and WCFs that have
received final approval in the form of a building permit prior to the effective
date hereof shall be considered existing.
      D.   A WCF may be rebuilt at a new location on the same site in a
nonresidential zone through an administrative review process, providing that
its new location adheres to the aesthetic zone requirement described below in
subsection (6). The existing WCF must be removed within six (6) months of the
approval of its replacement. The owner(s) of the existing tower must agree to
pay fees incurred by the city to remove the WCF should they fail to comply with
the removal procedures. This removal agreement will be a condition of approval.
   (6)   Height And Setbacks: Towers and antennas, where specially permitted,
shall comply with the following height and setback limitations. For purposes of
land use, height, and setback considerations, land is divided into residential,
nonresidential, and public rights-of-way:
      A.   Setbacks:
         1.   Aesthetic Zone: A circle centered around the center of the base
of the WCF and whose radius is the height of the WCF when in a residential zone
or ½ the WCF height when in a nonresidential zone.
            (A)   Aesthetic zone requirements shall only apply to large scale
facilities such as tower, monopole, and other similar style facilities.
            (B)   The aesthetic zone shall be located entirely on the same
parcel as the WCF, and therefore increase the minimum setback distance from the
property line beyond other code minimum setback requirements.
            (C)   No permanent structures shall be located within the aesthetic
zone that are not directly associated with the WCF (i.e. fences, storage sheds,
etc.) unless it is a non-enclosed structure (i.e. carport, gazebo, etc.).
            (D)   The aesthetic zone shall be visually enhanced with
landscaping or decorative fences/walls in a manner that shields the bottom of
the structure and any ancillary equipment from view of adjacent properties or
public rights-of-way.
            (E)   A WCF is exempt from the aesthetic zone provisions if the
height of the WCF does not exceed the maximum height provisions (if any are
established) of the underlying zoning district by more than 25%.
         2.   Setback Restrictions: Each of Caldwell’s land use zones has an
accompanying setback restriction. WCFs not subject to the aesthetic zone
requirements shall meet the setback requirements of the underlying zone.
         3.   Small-scale facilities that receive approval from the appropriate
jurisdiction or agency to be co-located in the public right-of-way on an
existing utility, light, or street pole are exempt from the setback
requirements.
      B.   Residential Zones:
         1.   WCFs are permitted to be a maximum height of eighty feet (80').
This residential limit is based on the average height of a mature tree in
Caldwell.
         2.   The eighty-foot (80') height limitation may be extended by means
of a height bonus, up to one-hundred (100) feet in height, as a collocation
incentive, provided the height addition does not exceed the parcel’s ability to
meet the underlying aesthetic zone.
         3.   A residential parcel cannot be rezoned to a nonresidential parcel
for the purpose of constructing a WCF to a greater height.
         4.   No variance or administrative exception is available to extend
the WCF beyond the noted height provisions.
         5.   WCFs must comply with all airport height restrictions.
      C.   Nonresidential Zones:
         1.   WCFs will be restricted to a maximum height of two-hundred feet
(200').
         2.   WCFs shall also be subject to any height restrictions related to
the airport zone or airport overlay districts.
         3.   WCFs located in a nonresidential zone must be set back from any
abutting residential zone a distance equal to the height of the WCF as a means
to further buffer incompatible uses.
      D.   Public Rights-Of-Way:
         1.   Only small-scale facilities may be located in a public right-of-
way, no tower or monopole style facilities are permitted.
         2.   Small-scale facilities may be co-located on existing utility,
light, or street poles and shall not extend more than six feet (6') above the
existing pole.
         3.   Antennas located on street poles shall be either fully concealed
within the street pole or camouflaged to appear to be an integrated part of the
street pole. An antenna not flush mounted on the side of the street pole shall
be centered on the top of the street pole to which it is attached and
camouflaged or disguised
         4.   No wireless communication equipment shall be mounted on any
decorative pole located in the right-of-way.
         5.   Facility locations mid-block should be prioritized over
intersection locations whenever feasible.
         6.   When located within a city right-of-way, wireless communication
facilities shall not impede existing and future facilities, including
sidewalks, stormwater infrastructure, water infrastructure, and electric
infrastructure, and other infrastructure included in adopted city plans.
      E.   Accessory Structures:
         1.   Large-Scale facilities: No structure accessory to a WCF or
antenna shall be more than twelve feet (12') in height and shall not have more
than two hundred fifty (250) square feet of gross floor area per carrier to a
maximum of one thousand (1,000) square feet in total gross floor area for
accessory structures.
         2.   Small-Scale: All accessory equipment associated with the antenna
cumulatively shall not exceed more than twenty-eight (28) cubic feet in volume.
      F.   Historic Properties: All WCFs must be set back four hundred feet
(400') from any property listed on the national register of historic places.
The planning and zoning director may reduce the setback after consultation with
the historic preservation commission, provided the WCF is creatively designed
so that it will not detract from its surroundings.
      G.   Prohibition: WCFs are prohibited within three hundred feet (300') of
parcels with hospitals, daycares, schools, and institutions of higher
education, for the purpose of allaying possible safety concerns. This
restriction may be waived if written authorization for the placement of the WCF
is received from the affected hospital, school, and/or institution of higher
education.
      H.   Conflict: If there is a conflict between setback requirements, the
greater setback shall prevail.
   (7)   Uses:
      A.   A WCF may be considered the principal or accessory use.
      B.   A WCF may be placed on a land parcel with a preexisting land use if
the uses are compatible. It is the responsibility of the applicant to prove to
the planning and zoning director’s satisfaction that the uses are compatible.
      C.   If an applicant is seeking to place a WCF on a land parcel already
subject to a special use permit, it may be a basis for denying the application.
      D.   A temporary WCF or antenna erected for test purposes, emergency
communication, or for broadcast remote pickup operations shall not require a
building permit or special use permit. The temporary period must be established
and approved as part of an administrative review prior to the placement of the
WCF or antenna.
   (8)   Design:
      A.   Installation:
         1.   Large-Scale Facilities:
            (A)   WCFs that are one hundred feet (100') in height, up to and
including one hundred twenty-five feet (125') in height shall be structurally
designed to accommodate at least two (2) service providers.
            (B)   WCFs that are between one hundred twenty-five feet (125') and
one hundred fifty feet (150') in height shall be structurally designed to
accommodate at least three (3) service providers.
            (C)   WCFs that are one hundred fifty feet (150') in height or
greater shall be structurally designed to accommodate at least four (4) service
providers.
         2.   Small-Scale Facilities:
            (A)   Small scale wireless communication antennas mounted on
buildings shall blend with the existing building’s architecture by painting or
shielding with material which is consistent with the design features and
materials of the building.
            (B)   Roof attached facilities shall not extend five feet (5')
above the highest portion of the roof, except for the wireless antennas and
support systems for whip antennas, which shall not extend more than ten feet
(10') above the highest portion of the roof.
            (C)   Facilities attached to a building roof shall be setback a
distance equal to the facility height or ten feet (10') from the building roof
edge, whichever is more.
            (D)   Facade attached facilities shall not exceed five feet (5') in
height above the facade to which it is attached.
            (E)   The maximum horizontal projection for a wireless
communication facility attached to a building façade is eighteen inches (18").
            (F)   Antenna shall fit in an enclosure no greater than 9 cubic
feet in volume.
      B.   Materials:
         1.   Colors, materials, textures, screening, and landscaping shall be
used to blend the WCF into the natural setting and/or the built environment and
shall be approved by the city as a part of the review process.
         2.   Metal towers shall be treated with corrosive resistant materials;
wood poles shall be treated with a rot-resistant application.
      C.   Lighting: No antenna or WCF shall have stationary lights, strobe
lights, reflectors, flashers, or other illumination devices attached to it
except during times of repair or as specifically required by the federal
aviation administration, the federal communications commission, or other
agencies of jurisdiction. If lighting is required, the design chosen must cause
the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
      D.   Location Standards:
         1.   No freestanding wireless communication facilities, including
equipment enclosures shall be located between the face of a habitable building
and a public street, trail, or park.
      E.   Signage: Signs, including advertisement, are prohibited on WCFs,
other than to provide warning or equipment information.
      F.   Access:
         1.   Climbing pegs shall be removed from the bottom twenty feet (20')
of the WCFs and replaced only for maintenance purposes to discourage use by
unauthorized persons. Climbing guards shall be placed on conduit risers to
prevent climbing of underground risers.
         2.   All WCFs shall be surrounded by a security fence as a means of
further deterrence. The security fence shall not exceed a height of six feet
(6') in a residential zone or eight feet (8') in all other zones. The fence
shall have a locked gate and shall be at least eighty-five percent (85%)
opaque. Landscaping may be required as a condition of approval.
      G.   Identification: A sign no larger than two feet (2') in height or
width shall be mounted on the outside of the security fence identifying the
owner of the tower and a contact number.
      H.   Compliance:

of the federal communications commission, federal aviation administration, or
other agencies of jurisdiction regulating WCFs. If the standards and
regulations change, the WCF shall come into compliance with them within six (6)
months. The failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with new
standards and regulations in a timely manner will constitute grounds for
removal of the WCF at the owner’s expense.
         4.   If a WCF is built on an undeveloped lot, it may be required to
come into compliance with other land use requirements such as placement of
curbs and gutters.
      I.   Noise: The WCF and accessory structures shall not produce noise
levels separately or accumulatively above forty-five (45) decibels as measured
from the nearest property line on which the WCF is located.
   (9)   Abandoned Towers:
      A.   The owner of any WCF must notify the Caldwell planning and zoning
department in writing within thirty (30) days that a WCF is no longer
operational. Any WCF not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months
shall be considered abandoned.
      B.   A nonoperational WCF shall be removed within six (6) months of the
city’s determination that the structure is abandoned or nonoperational.
      C.   If a WCF and accompanying facilities are not removed within six (6)
months, they may be removed by the city and the associated costs assessed
against the property.
      D.   The abandonment provision shall become effective when the WCF has no
operational component.
      E.   Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the
planning and zoning director based upon documentation and/or affidavits from
the WCF or antenna owner/operator regarding the issue of usage.
   (10)   Airport:
      A.   Any construction sponsor is required to submit a notice to the city,
federal aviation administration (FAA), and Idaho transportation department,
division of aeronautics, if the construction exceeds the following:
         1.   If the proposed object would be more than one hundred fifty feet
(150') above ground level at its location.
         2.   If the proposed object would be within twenty thousand feet
(20,000') and would exceed one foot (1') in height for each one hundred feet
(100') horizontally from the nearest point of the nearest runway.
      B.   The preferred form of notification is the FAA form 7460-1; this form
needs to be filled out in full and include all recommended attachments.
      C.   An antenna tower will be prohibited if its height exceeds the
following:
         1.   Any of the imaginary surfaces as defined by federal aviation
regulation part 77 for the most demanding future approach anticipated for the
airport,
         2.   Any of the surfaces as defined by FAA handbook 8260.3, “United
States Standards For Terminal Instrument Procedures” (TERPS) for the most
demanding future approach anticipated for the airport,
         3.   If it is determined to be a hazard to air navigation by the FAA.
      D.   Any antenna tower will be marked and lighted in accordance with FAA
advisory circular 70/7460-1K change 1 if it is determined that:
         1.   It is a hazard to air flight as defined by Idaho Code 21-513
through 21-520 and Idaho transportation department rule 39.04.02,
         2.   It is one hundred fifty feet (150') above ground level at its
location,
         3.   Lighting and marking is recommended by either the FAA or the
Idaho division of aeronautics.
      E.   The city will use the obstruction determinations prepared by the
federal aviation administration and the Idaho division of aeronautics as their
own for the purposes of administering these height restrictions.
   (11)   Other:
      A.   The placement of WCFs in historical designated areas and within one
hundred feet (100') of future designated presentation streets is discouraged
and may subject the WCF to additional requirements.
      B.   In addition to the conditions imposed by this chapter, the planning
and zoning commission and/or the hearing examiner reserve the right to attach
additional conditions, to include specific placement provisions, time
durations, and financial bonds.
      C.   In the event that police, fire, ambulance, or other emergency
services experience interference attributable to the transmissions of a WCF or
antenna, the antenna or WCF will be considered to be in violation of this
section and the service provider shall immediately reconcile the conflict and
provide the municipality a written correspondence explaining the actions that
were taken to pronounce remedy. (Ord. 3670, 4-21-2025)

10-13-05: Application Process
10-13-06: Flexibility in Applying Zoning Standards
10-13-07: Infill Development
10-13-01: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   (1)   Intent: A planned unit development involves a parcel of land which is
planned and developed as a unit under single ownership or control, containing
one or more uses, buildings, and common open space or recreational facilities.
The planned unit development process is not intended to skirt development
rules, nor does it result in a detrimental impact on the surrounding community
through its implementation. The administrative procedures for a planned unit
development shall be the same as applied to special use permits.
   (2)   Purpose: It shall be the purpose of this section to encourage the
efficient use of resources, promote greater efficiency in public and utility
services, preservation of open space, efficient use of alternative
transportation and encouraging innovation in the planning and building of all
types of development. Such developments may be permitted without customary
division into individual lots, or without specific conformance with the zoning
district regulations as applicable to individual lots or traditional
subdivisions subject to the regulations as provided in this chapter.
      A.   Required Objectives: The planned unit development process is
intended to provide flexibility, latitude and relief from the provisions of the
zoning ordinance only if the proposed development is consistent with two (2) or
more of the following instances:
         1.   The development offers a maximum choice of living environments by
allowing a variety of housing and building types.
         2.   The development promotes mixed-use projects which are
functionally integrated within the development and provides services for the
primary use.
         3.   The development provides a layout which preserves and properly
utilizes natural topography and geologic features, trees, scenic vistas or
other vegetation.
         4.   Where a land parcel is constrained or otherwise limited by some
obstacle, feature, geometry, condition, or easement that interferes with
applying standard development processes.
         5.   The development is an infill development, on less than five (5)
acres, that contributes a compatible design to the existing neighborhood. (Ord.
3671, 4-21-2025)
10-13-02: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   (1)   The planning and zoning commission and the city council shall consider
approval of planned unit developments in accordance with the following
standards:
      A.   Changes: Changes in the development standards and bulk regulations
of the underlying zone may be approved as per subsection
10-13-05 of this section.
      B.   Uses: Uses shall be limited to those uses which are permitted or
specially permitted within the base zoning district. No more than 70% of the
development shall be devoted to a single type of land use.
      C.   Latitude: Following the spirit and purpose of this section, much
greater latitude is permitted than in conventional and traditional regulations
for development.
      D.   Discretionary Powers: In consideration of the latitude given, the
planning and zoning commission and city council shall have discretionary powers
in judging and approving or disapproving the imaginative or unique concepts,
innovations, and designs which shall be incorporated into the plans presented,
provided that the planned unit development shall conform to the general
purposes and objectives of the comprehensive plan.
      E.   Residential Density: The number of dwelling units allowed in a
planned unit development shall be calculated by multiplying the gross area and
the dwelling units permitted in the underlying land use classification shown on
the comprehensive plan map. A planned unit development shall be consistent with
the density guidelines provided in the comprehensive plan and this chapter.
      F.   Residential Uses: Where a development is proposed to be exclusively
residential, a variety of three (3) or more housing types or residential uses
shall be included in a planned unit development regardless of the zoning
classification of the district, provided that the overall density for the base
zoning district is maintained. For the purposes of this section, single-family
residential lots with an area difference of 200% or more shall qualify as
separate housing types. No housing type shall provide fewer than 10% of the
proposed dwelling units.
      G.   Commercial Uses: When planned unit developments include commercial
uses, commercial buildings and establishments, the development shall be planned
as groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in
order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections. A
planned unit development shall follow section
10-02-09-6 (buffers between land uses) of this chapter. The plan of the project
shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design of buildings, and for
adequate and properly arranged facilities as reasonably necessary for internal
traffic circulation.
      H.   Future Development: All areas designed for future development or
expansion or not intended for immediate improvement shall be landscaped or
otherwise maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
      I.   Required Setbacks: Townhomes within a planned unit development are
permitted to have a 0' side yard setback.
      J.   Clustering: Every clustered area developed under the planned unit
development approach should be designed to abut upon common open space or
recreational amenities. Clustering is desired in mixed unit developments.
      K.   Parking: Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the
parking requirements as specified by
10-02-05 of this chapter.
      L.   Access: All lots developed as single-family residential lots shall
front or shall have frontage along a public roadway or common driveway. All
other lots developed for residential purposes shall front a public roadway or
shall utilize common driveways as regulated by Section
11-03-02 or shall comply with Section
10-14-02.
      M.   Ownership: A planned unit development shall be under single
ownership/control during the planning and developmental stage to ensure that
the development can be accomplished in a unified manner. A PUD developer may
sell a portion of an approved PUD if the purchaser submits a notarized letter
to the planning and zoning director stating that he/she reviewed the order of
decision, development agreement, phasing plan, and all other applicable
materials and agrees to comply with all conditions of approval.
      N.   Planned Unit Development Size: Unless the site qualifies as an
infill development, the overall site shall consist of a minimum gross area of
ten (10) acres.
      O.   Phasing Plan: The applicant shall submit a phasing plan for all

10-14-03: MULTI-FAMILY ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
   (1)   Purpose:
      A.   Promote visually aesthetic building designs that incorporate quality
architectural characteristics and establish built environments that are
compatible with existing, planned, and anticipated adjacent land uses.
      B.   Promote building design that encourages an aesthetically appealing
and safe places to live, while contributing to the pedestrian environment.
      C.   Emphasize architectural building forms that support compatible
building scales and contribute to the quality of the neighborhood, while
maintaining four-sided architecture.
      D.   Create multi-family and accessory structures that add visual
interest and contribute to the human scale of the development by incorporating
appropriate color and material changes to promote quality appearance and
character.
      E.   Encourage the integration of architectural lighting as cohesive
elements of building design that contribute to the atmosphere of the built
environment and promote safe pedestrian environments.
   (2)   Applicability: All new multi-family residential buildings and
accessory buildings such as detached garages, clubhouses, maintenance
buildings, etc. shall comply with the architectural design standards as set
forth in this section.
   (3)   Design Standards:
      A.   Building Form:
         1.   Building facades shall be varied with horizontal and vertical
elements that break up long blank walls, add visual interest, and enhance the
character of the neighborhood.
         2.   Wall modulation shall occur to articulate wall planes, break up
building mass, and delineate separate unit entrances. Qualifying modulation
includes, but is not limited to: projections, recesses, and primary façade step
backs that occur no less than 30 horizontal feet.
            (a)   Modulation may be averaged over the length of the façade so
long as no wall segment exceeds 40% of the overall wall length without
qualifying modulation.
         3.   Qualifying wall modulation shall be a minimum of one (1) foot in
depth and two (2) feet in width. When part of a townhome style building
(single-family or multi-family), each dwelling unit shall be modulated at least
two (2) feet in depth to delineate each unit and break up wall segments.
         4.   Ground level and upper stories shall be clearly distinguished
using any combination of material type, color variation, banding, stringcourse,
or modulation.
         5.   Second-story facades shall not extend beyond the front face of
first-story facades without additional façade modulation or additional material
types and architectural accents.
         6.   Building entries shall be visible and clearly marked with
canopies, porches, gables, and/or similar architectural elements; entries may
pop-out or be recessed to meet this standard.
         7.   Residential entries and multi-family stairwells shall provide
convenient access to and from parking and pedestrian areas while being
integrated into the overall site and building design.
         8.   Windows shall provide relief, detail, and variation on the
façade. This may occur through the use of significant trim and architectural
styling that lends human scale to the façade through recesses, projection, or
trim that is visually significant and features a color that is contrasting to
the primary façade color.
         9.   Where building codes allow and privacy is intended, clear-story
windows may be incorporated into building designs and may count towards any
glazing requirement.
         10.   Accessory structures shall be similar and compatible to primary
multi-family structures and incorporate similar materials and colors. Carports
and other post type construction are exempt from the material requirement of
this standard but must be compatible in design and color.
      B.   Materials and Colors:
         1.   Quality, durable materials that add visual interest shall be used
in building design from the following basic groups: wood, masonry, concrete,
metal, and glazing.
         2.   A minimum of three (3) primary materials are required on all
front and rear façade elevations or facades exceeding forty (40) feet in
length. If an elevation is less than forty (40) feet in length, a minimum of
two (2) materials is required. A mix of material patterns of the same primary
material may count towards this requirement if used with distinct but cohesive
colors and meets all other material requirements of this section.
         3.   A minimum of two (2) colors is required along all façade
elevations as part of the primary color scheme.
         4.   An accent color and/or material is required along all façade
planes.
         5.   Smooth vinyl siding is prohibited. Textured vinyl siding (fiber
cement board, Hardie-board, etc., or similar) permitted provided it does not
exceed 50% of the facade area for each elevation. When vinyl siding is used, a
mix of material patterns is encouraged including, but not limited to: board and
batten, horizontal and vertical lap, shake, or shingles.
         6.   Consistent material and color combinations should be used
throughout the project site to contribute to a cohesive community design.
         7.   Primary materials and accent materials shall be distinguished
through pattern, texture, or additional detail. Alternate masonry or material
courses may count towards this.
         8.   Untextured concrete panels and prefabricated steel panels (i.e.
non-insulated metal siding) are prohibited as primary façade materials but may
be used as an accent material.
      C.   Rooflines:
         1.   Modulate and articulate roof forms to create building profile
interest and to reduce the appearance of building mass and scale.
         2.   Provide variations in roof profile including, but not limited to,
at least two of the following: two or more visible roof planes; dormers,
lookout, turret, gables, towers, or cornice work, spaced consistently along the
façade plane. The maximum roof length without variation(s) shall be 75 feet.
         3.   Qualifying roofline variations shall be a minimum 1-foot in
height.
         4.   Any rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened from view of
any public rights-of-way or existing single-family residential by a concealing
roofline, a terraced façade, or some other type of approved screening material.
      D.   Fencing:
         1.   Where site-obscuring fencing or screening is required, chain link
fencing or chain link fencing with slats is prohibited as a qualifying fencing
material.
         2.   All other fencing proposed shall be of durable material and
maintained in a clean and weather protected manner.
      E.   Lighting: Lighting design should consider the appropriate placement
and quantity flight to provide for security and aesthetic appreciation while
avoiding glare and excessive brightness as follows:
         1.   Lighting shall be directed toward the ground and include shields
to minimize any glare or light trespassing.
         2.   Light fixtures shall be consistent with other decorative hardware
on the multi-family buildings.
         3.   Lighting on buildings and along pedestrian walkways shall promote
safe pedestrian environments.
         4.   Lighting fixtures used to illuminate the parking and vehicle
circulation areas shall be no greater than twenty-five (25) feet in height,
downlit, and fully shielded.
         5.   No light trespassing above 0.1 foot-candles is permitted from any
parcel onto another. Light readings shall be measured at a height of five (5)
feet above grade and in a plane at any angle of inclination. (Ord. 3672, 4-21-

a waiver may be appealed to the City Council by submission of a letter by the
applicant to the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of said
written decision.
               iv.   Provide copies of the recorded record of survey and
recorded deeds to the planning and zoning department. Upon receipt of said
documents, the planning and zoning department will issue a zoning compliance
letter for each resulting lot or parcel. Zoning compliance letters should

is buildable.
         6.   Administrative Lot Split:
            (A)   Where a parcel is being divided by a right of way dedication,
such dedication shall be achieved through an administrative lot split. For the
purposes of this dedication, the requirement for the parcel to be in its
original configuration as specified in subsection E5 is not applicable, and the
administrative lot split will not count towards and negate the ability to do a
simple lot split on the subject parcels in the future. All resulting lots or
parcels shall meet all applicable zoning, lot size, lot density, and setback
requirements.
            (B)   Lots or parcels divided by public right of way, in existence
prior to the date of the adoption of this subsection, are not required to
perform an administrative lot split. An existing lot or parcel divided by a
right of way may request to split the divided lots or parcels in order to
create legal parcels for the purpose of development and or the sale of one or
more of the lots or parcels. For the purposes of this subsection, an approved
administrative lot split will not count towards and negate the ability to do a
simple lot split on the subject parcels in the future. All resulting lots or
parcels shall meet all applicable zoning, lot size, lot density, and setback
requirements. (Ord. 2768, 4-20-2009; amd. Ord. 2811, 11-2-2009; Ord. 2924, 4-

building permits, if construction of all improvements is not completed within
one hundred and twenty (120) days following the date of recordation of the
final plat, no building permits shall be applied for by the subdivider or
issued by the city until final completion of all improvements by the subdivider
has taken place and the city has inspected and approved all improvements.
      A.   Provided, however, that if the failure to complete all improvements
within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period occurs through no fault of
the subdivider (no fault of the subdivider does not include economic or market
conditions), the city engineer at his or her sole discretion, may grant time
extensions to the one hundred and twenty (120) day period of a minimum one
hundred and twenty (120) days each.
   (6)   Under no circumstances shall the city ever issue more than eighty
percent (80%) of the total building permits ultimately available for the
subdivision or phase until final completion of all improvements for said
subdivision or phase by the subdivider has taken place and said improvements
have been inspected and approved by the city engineer.
   (7)   The financial guarantee is good for one year only. If construction of
improvements has not been completed within one year of submittal of the
financial guarantee, the city engineer at his or her sole discretion, may grant
a onetime only extension to the one year period, said onetime only extension
not to exceed one additional year.
      A.   The renewal amount shall be set at one hundred seventy-five percent
(175%) of the city engineer's estimate of cost on the remaining work.
      B.   Estimated cost on remaining work shall be determined in part by
detailed bids from the subdivider's contractors as issued on said contractors'
letterhead and submitted to the city engineer.
   (8)   If construction of the improvements has not been completed within the
original one year time period or the additional one year time period granted by
the city engineer through an extension, the city engineer shall inform the
council, through the public hearing process, at a regularly scheduled meeting.
      A.   The council may determine that the remaining work not completed by
the subdivider will be completed by the city and the construction costs
recovered from the financial guarantee; or
      B.   The council may approve a second one year time extension for
completion of the work by the subdivider.
         1.   The renewal amount shall be set at two hundred percent (200%) of
the city engineer's estimate of cost on the remaining work.
         2.   Estimated cost on remaining work shall partially be determined by
detailed bids from the subdivider's contractors as issued on said contractors'
letterhead and submitted to the city engineer.
      C.   Further time extensions of financial guarantees beyond the second
one year time extension are prohibited.
   (9)   Financial guarantees shall not be released by the city unless and
until all of the improvements (including required dedications) have been
completed by the subdivider and accepted by the city engineer and by any other
applicable agencies or city departments responsible for acceptance and
maintenance.
   (10)   Financial guarantees shall be written to allow the city to draw upon
the financial guarantee at any time at the discretion of the city engineer as
well as allowing multiple draws by the city. (Ord. 2811, 11-2-2009; Ord. 3456,

12-15-03: Definitions
12-15-05: General Provisions
12-15-07: Administration
12-15-09: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
12-15-11: Legal Status Provisions
12-15-01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   (1)   Statutory Authority: The Legislature of the State of Idaho in Idaho
Code sections 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local government units to
adopt a floodplain map and Floodplain Management Ordinance that identifies
floodplains and that sets forth minimum development requirements in floodplains
that are designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of
its citizenry. The City is further authorized by Idaho Code section 50-333 to
"prevent the flooding of the City", and by portions of Idaho Code section 67-
6518 to create and adopt the standards found within this article. (Ord. 2875,
5-16-2011, eff. 5-24-2011)
   (2)   Findings Of Fact: The flood hazard areas of the City of Caldwell are
subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
      A.   These flood losses are caused by development in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities. (Ord. 3207, 3-4-2019)
      B.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adoption and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management. (Ord. 2875, 5-16-2011, eff. 5-24-2011)
   (3)   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this article to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      A.   Protect human life, health, and property;
      B.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      C.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      D.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      E.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      F.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      G.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      H.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (4)   Objectives: In order to accomplish its purpose, this article includes
methods and provisions to:
      A.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      B.   Restrict or prohibit developments which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood
heights, velocities, or erosion;
      C.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      D.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      E.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters. (Ord. 3207, 3-4-
2019)
12-15-03: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this
article shall be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common
usage.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE): A structure on the same lot or
parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
   ADDITION (To An Existing Building): An extension or increase in the floor
area or height of a building or structure.
   APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of provisions of this article or request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
   BASEMENT: The area of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BUILDING: See definition of structure.
   CRITICAL FACILITY: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
   DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points)
from which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of
points has been the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The
vertical datum currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for
measuring heights is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
   DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.

community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
   ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The Elevation Certificate is an important
administrative tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood
insurance premium rate; it is used to document elevation information; and it
may be used to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter
of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
   ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area
formed when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
   ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or
alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community May 2, 1975.
   EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM): The FBFM shows how the floodplain is
divided into the floodway and flood fringe where streams are studied in detail.
They also show general floodplain areas where floodplains have been studied by
approximate methods. (Old format pre 1986.)
   FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
   FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of the City, issued by the
Federal Insurance Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been
designated as Zones A, M, and/or E.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of the community, issued by
the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood
hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has
been made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map
(DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): An examination, evaluation, and determination
of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations;
or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING: (1) A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A. The overflow of inland waters;
      B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source;
      C. Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as
defined in subsection (1)B of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid
and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is
carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.
   (2)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection (1)A of this definition.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the
freeboard.
   (1)   In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevation (BFEs) have
been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus one foot (1') of
freeboard; and
   (2)   In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established,
this elevation shall be at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent
grade.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of
flooding in the area, and applicable insurance rate.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this article, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventative measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning Ordinances, subdivision
regulations, Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a Floodplain Ordinance, Grading Ordinance, and Erosion Control
Ordinance), and other applications of police power. The term describes such
State or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation
(BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE).
Freeboard shall be one foot (1').
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register.
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district.
   (3)   Individually listed on a State Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or
   (4)   Individually listed on a Local Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      A. By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      B. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FIRMs that can be accomplished by letter.
They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and
Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
      Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies
with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to
delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon
submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building
permits and/or flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR,
because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
      Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
ground above the base flood elevation.
      Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR):   FEMA's modification to an effective
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) or
both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the
modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the
affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
      Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F):   FEMA's modification of
the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
The LOMR-F does not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
   LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to
the structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to
building elevation information.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is
not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not
built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this article.
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built
on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of
any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on the City's FIRM are referenced.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover, and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
created by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced Building and Zoning Ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which
the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures. Any construction started after May
2, 1975 and before the effective start date of this article is subject to the
ordinance in effect at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of
construction was within one hundred eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management
regulations adopted by a community May 2, 1975.
   POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before September 3, 1980, the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   (1)   Built on a single chassis,
   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this article or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least
two (2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in
any 10-year period since 1978.
   RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard
area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
See definition of "substantial improvement". For insurance purposes,
substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on
two (2) separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds
twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not include either:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications,
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure", and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
article.
   TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS:   FEMA publications that
provide guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations section
60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and
local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and
by members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
It should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide
guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the State or local Building Code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
article.
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies
in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE: For the purposes of this article only, a lake, river, creek,
stream, wash, channel, or other topographic feature within a flood hazard area
in which water regularly flows or is known to experience frequent non-
anthropogenic flooding. (Ord. 2875, 5-16-2011, eff. 5-24-2011; Ord. 2923, 4-15-
2013; Ord. 3207, 3-4-2019)

1972, 33 USC 1334.
      C.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA). (This is the
LOMC procedure.)
      D.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. (This is a hydraulic and
hydrology analysis.)
      E.   Prevent encroachments into floodways unless the certification and
flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection (5) of this section are met.
      F.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation. A person contesting the
location of the floodplain elevation boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation, as provided in this article.
      G.   Review plans to verify public utilities are constructed in
accordance with the provisions of subsections
12-15-09(1)E through (1)G of this article.
      H.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
and maintain certifications from a registered professional engineer or
architect in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3)C of this section
and subsection
 12-15-09(2)B of this article.
      I.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, and floodways (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this article.
      J.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
12-15-05(2) of this article, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE
data, along with floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other
source, including data developed pursuant to subsection
12-15-09(3)B of this article, in order to administer the provisions of this
article.
      K.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of subsection
12-15-05(2) of this article, require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
community. (This is a hydraulic and hydrology analysis.)
      L.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this article and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      M.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator
shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that
the work is being done according to the provisions of this article and the
terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has
a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      N.   Notify the Department of Building Safety to issue stop-work orders
as required. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed,
reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this article, the
Floodplain Administrator may notify the Building Department to order the work
to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed
to the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state
the specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and
the condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order shall constitute a violation of this article, and shall be punishable as
a violation of this article under subsection
12-15-05(8) of this article.
      O.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The Floodplain
Administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of State or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable State or local law may
also be revoked.
      P.   Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his or her Inspections Department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      Q.   Follow through with corrective procedures of subsection (4) of this
section.
      R.   Review, provide input, and make recommendations for variance
requests.

Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-Fs) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs).
      U.   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA) of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance
with this article. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
      V.   Upon occurrence, notify the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA) in
writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that all FHBMs and FIRMs accurately represent the community's boundaries,
include within such notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for
which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (3)   Floodplain Development Application, Permit, And Certification
Requirements:
      A.   Application Requirements: Application for a floodplain development
permit shall be made to the Floodplain Administrator prior to any development

         7.   The flood openings requirements.
         8.   Floodplain development permits shall expire if construction does
not commence ("start of construction") within one hundred eighty (180) days of
permit issuance. If the associated building permit is allowed to expire,
revoked, or abandoned, the respective floodplain development permit is also of
no further force or effect. Renewal or reinstatement of the permit with the
associated building permit requires resubmittal or, at a minimum, written
approval from the Floodplain Administrator.
         9.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor are usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage.
         10.   All materials below BFE must be flood resistant materials.
      C.   Certification Requirements:
         1.   Elevation Certificates:
            (A)   A Construction Drawings Elevation Certificate (FEMA Form 86-
0-33) is required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall
be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, in relation to mean sea
level. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder prior to the beginning of construction. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to deny a
floodplain development permit.
            (B)   A Building Under Construction Elevation Certificate (FEMA
Form 86-0-33) may be required by the Floodplain Administrator after the lowest
floor is established. Within seven (7) calendar days of establishment of the
lowest floor elevation, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor, in relation to mean sea level. Any work done within the seven (7) day
calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the
permit holder's risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to further work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
            (C)   A final as-built Finished Construction Elevation Certificate
(FEMA Form 86-0-33) is required after construction is completed and prior to
Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of
final as- built construction of the elevation of the lowest floor and all
attendant utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate
data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy.
The Finished Construction Elevation Certificate certifier shall provide at
least three (3) photographs showing the front, side, and rear of the building
taken within ninety (90) days from the date of certification. The photographs
must be taken with views confirming the building description and diagram number
provided in section A. To the extent possible, these photographs should show
the entire building including foundation. If the building has split-level or
multi-level areas, provide at least two (2) additional photographs showing side
views of the building. In addition, when applicable, provide a photograph of
the foundation showing a representative example of the flood openings or vents.
All photographs must be in color and measure at least 3" x 3". Digital
photographs are acceptable.
         2.   Floodproofing Certificate: If non-residential floodproofing is
used to meet the flood protection elevation requirements, design plans, with
supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan
are required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the floodproofed design elevation of the lowest floor and all
attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea level. Floodproofing certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer
or architect and certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review
the certificate data, the operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance
plan. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant
prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit. Prior to request for a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy a
Floodproofing Certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34) shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator for review and approval.
         3.   Engineered Foundation Certification: If a manufactured home is
placed within Zone A, AE, AH, AO, or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is
more than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade, an engineered
foundation certification is required in accordance with the provisions of
subsection
12-15-09(2)C2 of this article.
         4.   Altering Or Relocating Watercourse: If a watercourse within a
special flood hazard area is to be altered or relocated, the following shall
all be submitted by the permit applicant prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit:
            (A)   A description of the extent of watercourse alteration or
relocation; and

            (C)   Accessory structures less than two hundred (200) square feet
meeting requirements of subsection
12-15-09(2)G of this article.
      D.   Determinations For Existing Buildings And Structures: For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, improvements, repairs of
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the building official,
shall:
         1.   Estimate the market value, or if reasonably accessible means of
determining value cannot be obtained, require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
         2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
         3.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
         4.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the adopted
Idaho Building Code and this article is required.
   (4)   Corrective Procedures:
      A.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the Floodplain Administrator finds
violations of applicable State and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall remedy each of the violations of law cited in such notification.
      B.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the owner
of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating:
         1.   Violation: That the building or property is in violation of the
floodplain management regulations;
         2.   Order To Take Corrective Action: The Floodplain Administrator may
issue an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable. Said order shall specify the period of time in which the corrective
action must be taken. In the absence of corrective action within a specified
time, the City may move to abate or correct the problem at the owner's expense,
or pursue other such remedies authorized under the laws of the State of Idaho,

12-15-09: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   (1)   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
provisions are required:
      A.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      B.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and applicable Idaho Building Codes.
      C.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      D.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      F.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      G.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      H.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor used solely for parking,
access, and storage shall:
         1.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         2.   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (A)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (B)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

properties, necessitates a provision for the delivery of water and disposal of
sanitary sewage, necessitates the provision for the control of stormwater,
surface water and other drainage to ensure the orderly flow of surface waters
for the protection of adjoining properties and the protection of roads and
streets servicing said property; and therefore it is hereby found to be in the
best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Caldwell to
require certain minimum road improvements and right of way dedication, the
installation of curbs, gutters and sidewalks, and to require a connection to
the city sewer and water systems (when available) and to facilitate ready
connection to city services (when not presently available) as a condition
precedent to obtaining a building permit and in this regard to regulate the
placement of underground utilities. (Ord. 2794, 7-20-2009)
12-17-02: MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful and there shall be no development and/or construction and/
or special use permit upon any land located adjacent to or adjoining
unimproved, partially improved, or master planned public rights of way, nor
shall there be issued a building permit to any person who seeks development or
construction upon said lands unless the owner and/or the developer of such land
constructs minimum improvements upon public rights of way located adjacent to
or adjoining such land as are specified and provided for in the rules and
regulations for minimum construction requirements provided herein.
   (1)   This section does not apply to any residential premises having an
existing dwelling of more than six hundred (600) square feet of floor area and
that has been inhabited at any time within the twelve (12) months prior to
application date of the subject building permit, nor does this section apply to
any commercial and/or industrial premises wherein there is proposed

results in less than five thousand (5,000) square feet of additional floor
area.
   (2)   Any owner/developer claiming an exemption pursuant to subsection (1)
of this section must file an application with the City Engineer for an
exemption together with sufficient proof to establish the owner/developer right
to the exemption.
   (3)   This section does not apply to any development which qualifies as a
subdivision, as that term is defined in chapter 11, article 1 of this code.
   (4)   The rules, regulations and requirements of this article do apply to
all development of property resulting from Simple Lot Splits, as that term is
defined in chapter 11, article 1, of this code. (Ord. 2794, 7-20-2009; Ord.
3347, 5-17-2021)

Rules and regulations for minimum construction requirements and right of way
widths are required by this article as follows:
   (1)   Minimum right of way widths for each classification of street shall be
as required under the Caldwell subdivision ordinance (chapter 11 of this code).
At the discretion of the City Engineer, the right of way required for
dedication may be reduced to half minimum right of way width, on the side of
centerline for which the building permit is being applied, minus existing right
of way, and provided sufficient right of way exists on the opposite side of
centerline to construct half of the design street section with an asphalt mat
meeting that requirement but being not less than twenty-four feet (24') in
width.
   (2)   Improvements within right of way or site adjacent master planned right
of way shall be constructed in compliance with the current city of Caldwell
supplemental specifications to the Idaho standards for public works
construction and applicable sewer, water, trails/pathways, and transportation
master plans (detached single-family residential may not be required to comply
with sewer and water master plans if waived by the city engineer).
   (3)   Sidewalk, curb and gutter and streetlights shall be provided on the
street frontage on the side of centerline for which the building permit is
being applied, and shall be constructed in compliance with the current city of
Caldwell supplemental specifications to the Idaho standards for public works
construction.
   (4)   Building permits shall only be issued for parcels or lots conforming
to chapters 10 and 11 of this code.
   (5)   Structures being constructed pursuant to a building permit shall be
connected to public sewer and/or water in conformance with the rules for such
connections as prescribed in chapter 4 of this code. Ready connections to said
utilities shall be constructed in instances where public sewer and/or water are
not available at the time a building permit is issued.
   (6)   Structures being constructed pursuant to a building permit shall be
served by a storm disposal system designed and constructed in conformance with
the current city of Caldwell "Storm Water Management Manual". (Ord. 2794, 7-20-

met:
   (1)   The property is not located on an existing arterial street;
   (2)   There is no paved street and/or curb and gutter located within three
hundred feet (300') of the building footprint's closest edge projected
perpendicular to the right of way line. Cases may be escalated by the City
Engineer to the City Council for consideration in instances where the City
Engineer deems it commendable to allow deferral for businesses or residences
subject to this section closer to nonadjacent curb and gutter or pavement
improvements than three hundred feet (300'), provided the City Engineer finds,
on a case by case basis, that hardship or good cause exists for such allowance;
   (3)   An agreement by and between the City and the owner is recorded at the
developer's expense wherein the owner agrees as follows:
      A.   To voluntarily annex when legally able to do so (if not in corporate
limits) by submission of an application for annexation, including all
applicable fees, to the City of Caldwell Planning and Zoning Department to be
held until such time as annexation becomes available; at which time the City of
Caldwell Planning and Zoning Department will automatically annex said parcel
into the City of Caldwell city limits.
      B.   To the installation of the sidewalk, curb and gutter, and street
improvements at the expense of the owner after annexation (if annexation is
applicable) and upon sixty (60) days' notice by the City.
      C.   That no temporary or permanent structure or landscaping will be
added which shall impede pedestrian access in the area of the future sidewalk.
      D.   To participate in any local improvement district (LID) formed for
the purpose of completing any or all such improvements upon subject frontage.
      E.   To compliance with the terms of this section, the violation of which

12-17-05: RIGHT OF WAY PERMITS:
The owner/developer of any lands governed by this article shall submit an
application for a right of way permit on a form to be created by the
Engineering Department. No work shall be done in any public right of way until
said application has been approved and a right of way permit has been approved
and issued by the Engineering Department. The Engineering Department may set
out requirements for right of way permit applications so long as said
requirements are reasonably related to protecting persons and public property,
which requirements shall include, at a minimum, the following:
   (1)   Three (3) sets of all on and off site improvement plans, as prepared
and stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Idaho, which
plans shall include plans and profiles for street improvements, sidewalk, curb
and gutters, street lighting, sewer system, water system, and/or storm sewers
which shall be filed with the City Engineer along with any applicable plan
review fees; and which plans shall be reviewed by the City Engineer for
compliance with this article and any rules and regulations set forth herein. In
the event the City Engineer finds that the plans are in compliance, the City
Engineer shall so certify to the Building Official. In the event the City
Engineer finds that the plans are not in compliance, he shall so state and
advise the owner/developer of the specifics of the failure of compliance. Once
the City Engineer has approved said plans, a preconstruction meeting shall be
held prior to commencement of any construction on site. Preconstruction
meetings, construction, and inspections shall take place as outlined in section
11-04-04 of this code.
   (2)   A traffic control plan compliant with the IPWC Manual and the Caldwell
Supplement thereto.
   (3)   Proof of insurance in the amount not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000.00). The City of Caldwell shall be listed thereon as a certificate
holder and an additional insured. Said proof of insurance shall stipulate that
the City of Caldwell be held harmless in the event any claim is made. (Ord.

Prior to the City Engineering Department's signature on a permanent certificate
of occupancy, all improvements required herein shall be completed by the owner/
developer. The owner/developer may, in lieu of actual construction, file with
the city a financial guarantee. Financial guarantees provided in lieu of
construction will only be permitted for a duration to be approved by the City
Engineer. Failure on behalf of owner/developer to complete said requirements
within the time frame approved by the City Engineer may result in the City
exercising its rights to utilize funding available from the provided financial
guarantee to complete said improvements. In instances where the owner/developer
provides a financial guarantee in lieu of construction the owner/developer will
only be granted a temporary certificate of occupancy. A permanent certificate
of occupancy will not be granted until all required improvements are completed.
   (1)   Financial guarantees shall be in the form of:
      A.   Cash deposited with and held by the City pending final completion of
the improvements as required in this article; or
      B.   Cash backed irrevocable letter of credit, drawn from a financial
institution located within fifty (50) miles of the City, that has been
submitted to and accepted by the City Engineer and is irrevocable until final
completion of all required improvements as stated within this article;
      C.   Alternate forms of financial guarantee may be accepted by the City
upon a finding by both the City Attorney and the City Engineer that such
alternate form of financial guarantee is in the best interest of the City.
   (2)   Financial guarantees shall be submitted to and accepted by the City
Engineer prior to the City Engineering Department's signature on the permanent
certificate of occupancy.
   (3)   The financial guarantee shall be an amount equal to one hundred
twenty- five percent (125%) of the City Engineer's estimate of cost on the
remaining work as required in this article and shall include inflation, city
bidding disadvantage and city project management.
      A.   Estimated cost on remaining work as required in this article shall
be determined in part by detailed bids from the owner/developer's contractors
as issued on said contractors' letterhead and submitted to the City Engineer
and totaled. To that total, an allotment of five percent (5%) for inflation,
ten percent (10%) for city bidding disadvantage, and twelve percent (12%) for
city project management is figured and then added to the total bid amounts.
Then one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) is calculated and that is the
financial guarantee amount.
      B.   Remaining work as required in this article shall be determined by
the Engineering Department in the form of a punchlist which shall be compiled
by the Engineering Department following an inspection by the Engineering
Department. Remaining work shall not include anything other than what is
required in this article.
   (4)   The financial guarantee is good for twelve (12) months only. If
construction of improvements as required in this article has not been completed
within twelve (12) months of submittal of the financial guarantee, remaining
work as required in this article shall be completed by the City and the
construction costs recovered from the financial guarantee.
   (5)   Financial guarantees shall be written to allow the City to draw upon
the financial guarantee at any time at the discretion of the City Engineer as
well to allow multiple draws by the City.
   (6)   Financial guarantees shall not be released by the City unless and
until all of the improvements as required in this article (including required
dedications) have been completed by the owner/developer and accepted by the
City Engineer and by any other applicable agencies or City departments
responsible for acceptance and maintenance. (Ord. 2794, 7-20-2009; Ord. 3347,
5-17-2021)
12-17-07: NUISANCE:
Any improvements placed upon real property subject to this article without the
developer and/or owner having complied with the terms and conditions of this
article shall be considered a nuisance and the city may apply to the district
court for an injunction ordering the cessation of all construction activity
and/or the removal of all construction which occurred in violation of this
article. (Ord. 2794, 7-20-2009; Ord. 3347, 5-17-2021)

the hearing and make a decision in the absence of the petitioner.
   (5)   Referral To Other Boards: If the dispute appears to be under the
jurisdiction of any other board or commission, the Secretary of the Board shall
suggest to the person filing the appeal that he may apply for relief from such
other board or commission. The Appeals Board may defer action while such other
board is studying the action. The Board may, on its own motion, refer any
appeal to any such board, deferring action until the other board reaches a

excluded. A finding shall be based upon the kind of evidence on which
reasonable prudent persons are accustomed to rely for the conduct of their
serious affairs, and may be based upon such evidence even if it would be
inadmissible in a court of law. The Appeals Board shall give effect to the
rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to the evidentiary offers may
be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a
hearing will be expedited and the interest of the parties will not be
prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be required to be
submitted in verified written form.

and no decision at the hearing shall be valid and binding unless reached by a
majority of all members of the Board.

scheduled Council meeting, following receipt of the appeal, provided that a
notice period of at least fifteen (15) days be provided prior to said hearing.
If there is not sufficient time for allowing said notice then the public

wash waters, where no detergents are used and no spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have occurred (unless all spilled material has been
removed); fire hydrant flushing; or flows from emergency firefighting
activities; and where
            (B)   The discharges are not sources of pollution to Waters of the
United States (WOTUS). A discharge is considered a source of pollution to WOTUS
for the purposes of this section if it:
               i. Contains hazardous materials in concentrations found to be of
public health significance or to impair beneficial uses in receiving waters
(hazardous materials are those that are harmful to humans and animals from
exposure, but not necessarily ingestion);
               ii. Contains toxic substances in concentrations that impair
designated beneficial uses in receiving waters (toxic substances are those that
can cause disease, malignancy, genetic mutation, death, or similar
consequences);
               iii. Contains deleterious materials in concentrations that
impair designated beneficial uses in receiving waters (deleterious materials
are substances that contaminate the aquatic food chain and fish tissue for
human consumption, possible drinking water sources, or cause harm to the
aquatic environments);
               iv. Contains radioactive materials or radioactivity at levels
exceeding the values listed in 10 CFR part 20 in receiving waters;
               v. Contains floating, suspended, or submerged matter of any kind
in concentrations causing nuisance or objectionable conditions or in
concentrations that may impair designated beneficial uses in receiving waters;
               vi. Contains excessive nutrients that can cause visible slime
growths, harmful algal blooms, or other nuisance aquatic growths that impair
designated beneficial uses or public safety impairment in receiving waters;
               vii. Contains oxygen demanding materials in concentrations that
would result in anaerobic water conditions in receiving waters;
               viii. Contains sediment above quantities specified in IDAPA
58.01.02.250.02.e or in the absence of specific sediment criteria, above
quantities that impair beneficial uses in receiving waters; or
               ix. Contains material in concentrations that exceed applicable
natural background conditions in receiving waters (IDAPA 58.01.01.200.09).
Temperature levels may be increased above natural background conditions when
allowed under IDAPA 58.02.02.401.
      B.   Discharges Threatening Water Quality: No person is authorized to
discharge stormwater that will cause or have the reasonable potential to cause
or contribute to an excursion above the Idaho water quality standards.
      C.   Discharge Compliance with Antidegradation Policy: No person is
authorized to discharge stormwater that does not comply with Idaho's
antidegradation policy for water quality standards.
      D.   Snow Disposal to Receiving Waters: No person is authorized to
dispose of snow directly to WOTUS or directly to the MS4. Discharges are
authorized when such sites/practices are operated or performed in accordance
with the city of Caldwell's nonstormwater disposal best management practices
(BMPs).
      E.   Stormwater Discharges Associated With Industrial And Construction
Activity: Discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity (as defined
in 40 CFR 122.26(b)(14)), and stormwater associated with construction activity
(as defined in 40 CFR 122.26(b)(14)(x) and (b)(15)), is authorized only when
such discharges are otherwise authorized under an appropriate IPDES permit.
   (7)   Discharge Pursuant to IPDES Permit: The prohibition of discharges
shall not apply to any discharge regulated under an IPDES permit issued and
administered by the State of Idaho, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable laws or
regulations. Compliance with an applicable IPDES permit governing discharges
into the MS4 shall be considered compliance with this article.
   (8)   Compliance with IPDES Permits: Any discharge that would cause a
violation of a municipal IPDES permit and any amendments, revisions, or
reissuance thereof, either separately considered or when combined with other
discharges, is prohibited. Liability for any such discharge shall be the
responsibility of the person(s) causing or responsible for the discharge, and
the city shall seek to have such persons defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the city in any administrative or judicial enforcement action against the
permit holder relating to such discharge as provided by applicable rules of
law.
      All persons in charge of a facility are to comply with applicable federal
and state laws including facility personnel, training, training record
maintenance, training records, maintenance of notification procedures, and
implementation of notification requirements for spill response to assure
containment, cleanup, and immediate notification to the City of Caldwell.
      Individuals responsible for spills are to comply with applicable state
and federal notification requirements to assure containment, cleanup, and
immediate notification to the City of Caldwell. (Ord. 2884, 12-5-2011; amd.

13-01-05: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS AND COMPREHENSIVE DRAINAGE PLANS:
   (1)   Requirements: To minimize the discharge and transport of pollutants to
storm drains and prevent the deterioration of water quality, certain new
developments and redevelopment projects will be required to submit for approval
a stormwater management plan or a comprehensive drainage plan to control the
quality, volume and rate of stormwater runoff. The "Caldwell Municipal
Stormwater Management Manual" establishes standards and guidelines for
implementing BMPs and stormwater management plans and is incorporated by
reference and made part of this article.
      A.   Stormwater management plans or comprehensive drainage plans are
required for industrial, commercial, and institutional developments which
require a building permit and multi-family residential developments that are
not part of a larger subdivision project, as well as subdivision projects that
have private access, which also require a building permit.
      B.   Redevelopment projects may be required to submit complete stormwater
management plans or operation and maintenance plans if they meet the criteria
found in the "Caldwell Municipal Stormwater Management Manual".
      C.   Stormwater management plans and comprehensive drainage plans shall
be developed in accordance with the "Caldwell Municipal Stormwater Management
Manual".
      D.   The Caldwell City Council reserves the right to amend, modify, and/

      A.   Stormwater management designs and/or comprehensive drainage plans
shall be submitted at the time building or civil plans are submitted. The plans
shall be submitted to the City Building Department as part of the building
permit application package. In those instances where stormwater management
plans and comprehensive drainage plans are required, but no building permit is
required, said plans shall be submitted to the City Engineering Division. The
plans shall be reviewed by the City Engineering Department for their compliance
with the "Caldwell Municipal Stormwater Management Manual" and other applicable
rules and standards. Plans developed to meet federal or state requirements may
be submitted and will be approved if they substantially conform to the
requirements of this article.
         1.   No plan shall be approved that increases the peak level of
stormwater runoff from impervious areas, unless the plan identifies measures to
control and limit runoff to peak levels no greater than would occur from the
site if left in its natural, undeveloped condition.
         2.   No development or use of land which requires a stormwater
management plan or comprehensive drainage plan as per the "Caldwell Municipal
Stormwater Infrastructure Design Manual" shall be permitted without the City
Engineering Division approval of such plan.

      D.   Approval of the stormwater management plan or comprehensive drainage
plan does not relieve the owner or responsible party from the duty to ensure
the systems and their safety measures function as designed.
      E.   Approval may be suspended or revoked at any time if conditions are
not as stated or shown in the approved application or implementation of the
plan is not proceeding in the approved manner.
      F.   Approval of a stormwater management plan or a comprehensive drainage
plan may be suspended if the project is not completed within a two (2) year
period or development has ceased for a period of more than two (2) years;
however, a one year extension may be granted upon a written request which
provides the reason(s) for the delay or cessation of development and specifies
a time frame for completion or commencement of development.
      G.   If suspension or revocation of approval is necessary, the owner will
receive notice of this decision and may appeal to the City Engineer. A written
request for appeal and hearing must be made within ten (10) days of the notice
of suspension or revocation.
      H.   If approval is suspended or revoked, the owner shall be required to
submit a new plan for approval, with the requisite fee, prior to starting or
continuing the planned project or development.
      I.   If undue hardship would result from strict application of the
requirements of this article, a person may request a variance.
         1.   The variance request must be submitted in writing to the City

Division, the denial may be appealed to the City Council within ten (10) days
of notice of denial. The City Council shall provide the aggrieved party with a
hearing date and an opportunity to present an argument in favor of the variance
request. The City Council will not accept additional supporting documentation
if the information was reasonably available at the time the request for
variance was made and could have been submitted to the City Engineering
Division.
         4.   A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege.
      J.   Approval of any plans by the City Engineering Division shall not
create a liability on the part of or cause of action against the City or any
officer or employee thereof regarding the plan or its operation.
   (3)   Maintenance of Stormwater Facilities:
      A.   Stormwater facilities shall be maintained by the owner or other
responsible party and, when there is a potential to discharge stormwater, shall

accordance with City-approved plans.
      F.   If a stormwater BMP is failed and/or negatively impacts the MS4
system, the responsible party is required to address the issues with said BMP.
Any failure to maintain facilities or correct problems with facilities after
receiving due notice from the city may result in criminal or civil penalties
and the city may perform corrective or maintenance work which shall be at the
owner's expense.
      G.   Note that City staff shall adhere to the following corrective action
procedure in the event of a privately operated stormwater management system has
become a public nuisance.
         1.   Inspection and Citation: An inspection report, summary of
required actions, and Notice to Correct shall be sent to the responsible person
(s). This report shall address any BMP failures that require attention. A
Stormwater Division staff member shall perform a return inspection to ensure
corrective actions have been implemented.
         2.   Return Inspection and Notice of Violation/Notice to Clean:
Following a return inspection, if no or minimal action has been made by the
responsible person(s), a second Notice to Repair and Notice of Violation shall
be sent. A Public Works staff member shall perform a return inspection to
ensure corrective actions have been implemented sufficiently.
         3.   Cease and Desist Order with or without Penalty: If no action is
taken, the violator(s) will receive a citation, at the discretion of the
Inspector, and an initial monetary penalty amount, not to exceed $1,000. If no

Council shall hear the appeal at its earliest practical date and may either
affirm, revoke, or modify the order. The decision of the City Council shall be
final.
      C.   In the event the owner or operator of a facility fails to conduct
the monitoring and/or analyses and furnish the reports required by the order in
the time frames set forth therein, the City may cause such monitoring and/or
analyses to occur and assess all costs incurred, including reasonable
administrative costs and attorney fees, to the facility owner or operator. The
City may pursue judicial action to enforce the order and recover all costs
incurred, and monetary penalties from pollution to Idaho waters and/or WOTUS.
   (4)   Violations Constituting Misdemeanors: The knowing violation of any
provision of this article or knowing failure to comply with any of the
mandatory requirements of this article shall constitute a misdemeanor,
punishable as provided in Idaho Code sections 50-302(1) and 18-113, as amended.
Such knowing violator(s) will also incur a monetary penalty for violation of
the City's IPDES Permit.
   (5)   Continuing Violation: Unless otherwise provided, a person, firm,
corporation or organization shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for
each and every day during any portion of which a violation of this article is

13-05-09: Appeal Procedure
13-05-01: TITLE AND APPLICABILITY:
This article shall be known and may be referred to as the CALDWELL ACCESS
MANAGEMENT STANDARDS FOR CITY STREETS. 
For access management standards along state-owned highways within or near
Caldwell, the Idaho Transportation Department has authority for those highways,
and may be reached at their District 3 - Southwest Idaho office. (Ord. 3618, 8-
5-2024)
13-05-02: PURPOSE, BENEFITS AND GOALS OF ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
Access management is the control of the location, spacing, design and operation
of driveways, median openings, and street connections to the public rights-of-
way. Access management principles also help guide decisions involving land use
planning, corridor design, the movement of people, goods, and services by all
modes of transportation, and land development.
The purpose of access management is to support the desired land use patterns as
identified in established City planning documents, and support the safe and
efficient movement of people, goods, and services by all modes of
transportation.
Successful access management should support land use plans and priorities and
enhance the improvements to benefit all modes of transportation. Access
management benefits all modes of transportation, such as walking, biking,
transit, and motorized vehicle use of all types.
Using a combination of strategies derived from land use planning,
transportation planning, motorized and non-motorized transportation
engineering, livable street design and performance measurements, and law,
access management accomplishes the following:
   (1)   Advances land use and transportation plans and priorities of the City
by maintaining travel mobility for the efficient movement of people, goods, and
services by all modes of transportation.
   (2)   Helps preserve public investment in transportation facilities for all
users by maintaining the functional performance of these facilities as
intended.
   (3)   Promotes sustainable land use patterns while preserving the investment
in commercial, residential, and other developments that depend on all modes of
safe and reliable transportation.
   (4)   Improves safety and capacity by the appropriate use of turn lanes to
enter and exit the public right-of-way, thereby limiting motor vehicle speed
differences, decreasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, and promoting
reasonable travel times.
   (5)   Increases safety by reducing the number of potential traffic
collisions by reducing conflict points. (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-03: PRINCIPLES OF ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
The following general principals apply to proper access management:
   (1)   Provide appropriate land use access based on desired street purpose.
Different types of streets serve different functions. It is important to design
and manage streets according to the primary functions by which they are
expected to serve land use and transportation plans.
   (2)   Limit conflict points for all users. Driveways, unsignalized
intersections, and commercial access provide more opportunity for different
street users to cross paths. Access management seeks to limit these conflicts
to only those locations necessary to support the adjacent land uses.
   (3)   Limit direct access onto arterials (Principal and Minor) defined in
the most recently adopted Community Planning Association of Southwest Idaho
(COMPASS) Long-Range Planning Functional Classification Map for Canyon County,
including future updates to said map.
   (4)   Be coordinated with land use plans. Frequent and direct property
access is more compatible with the function of local and collector streets.
Some arterials support locations identified as activity centers by land use
jurisdictions. The City should seek to balance access management principles
with the vision of the land use plan.
   (5)   Promote intersection hierarchy. An efficient transportation network
that supports an efficient, diverse, and productive system of land uses
provides appropriate transitions from one classification of street typology to
another.
   (6)   Locate signals (or other intersection improvements) to support local
land uses determined by the partner agency to promote reasonable travel times.
Long, uniform spacing of intersections and signals on mobility arterials and
some major roadways enhances the ability to coordinate signals and ensure
continuous movement of motor vehicle traffic to promote reasonable travel
times. Failure to carefully locate access connections or median openings can
undermine land use values and public investment in those uses and may
unreasonably increase travel times.
   (7)   Limit conflicts near intersections and interchanges. Intersections and
interchanges require the greatest attention from all users. Safe movement is
paramount in these locations as all users are at the greatest risk of
conflicts. Limiting direct access in close proximity to intersections decreases
complexity and promotes increased awareness of other users.
   (8)   Limit the number of conflict points and help drivers pay attention to
the context of where they are driving. All users of the right-of-way make more
mistakes and are more likely to have collisions when they are not given cues to
expect the presence of people in or approaching the right-of-way.
   (9)   Separate conflict areas. All users traveling in the public rights-of-
way need sufficient time to address one potential set of conflicts before
facing another. The necessary spacing between conflict areas increases as
travel speed increases, helping to provide drivers adequate perception and
reaction time.
   (10)   Use non-traversable medians to manage left-turn movements in
appropriate locations. Medians channel motor vehicle turning movements on
mobility corridors and some arterials to designated locations. Therefore, non-
traversable medians and other techniques that minimize left turns or reduce
conflicts can be especially effective in improving safety. Full median
openings, which allow left turns by motor vehicles from either direction, are
best provided at signalized intersections and unsignalized junctions of
arterial and collector streets. Full median openings in other unsignalized
locations can adversely affect the safety of people in the public rights-of-way
and travel time but may be appropriate in some areas where analysis indicates
that traffic operations and the safety of people in the public right-of-way
would be improved.
   (11)   Provide connectivity by a supporting street and circulation system.
Well-planned communities provide a supporting network of local and collector
streets to accommodate development, as well as unified property access and
circulation systems. The most recently adopted COMPASS Long-Range Planning
Functional Classification Planning Map for Canyon County identifies the desired
collector network, which should be preserved with rare exception.
Interconnected street and circulation systems provide safe low-stress routes
for people traveling by all modes of transportation. In locations where this
connectivity has not been provided for, the arterial network bears an undue
burden. Commercial strip development with separate driveways for each business
and without the facilities to allow people to safely access and navigate those
developments by non-motorized transportation modes forces even short trips to
be made by motorized vehicle onto arterial streets, thereby impeding safety and
mobility and increasing travel times for all users of the public rights-of-way.
Connectivity and access management together help provide for a well-functioning
street network for all users.
   (12)   Utilization of modern roundabouts, particularly for collector and
local streets, shall be considered, and have advantages of fewer conflict
points and lower speeds. Intersection and driveway spacing at roundabouts is
treated similar to that for un-signalized intersections.
   (13)   Promote the maximum accessibility of properties, while recognizing
the City's right to restrict access, control traffic flow and assure safe
conditions, utilizing such items as traffic control devices, lane
configurations, and changes to access locations. (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-04: ACCESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS:
   (1)   Cross Motor Vehicle Access Easements/Shared Motor Vehicle Access:
Cross motor vehicle access utilizes a single vehicular connection that serves
two (2) or more adjoining lots or parcels so that the driver of a motor vehicle
does not need to re-enter the street system. The City may require cross access
or require the preservation of locations for future cross access.
   (2)   Temporary Access: Access by people using any mode of transportation
that is permitted for use until appropriate alternative access becomes
available. Temporary access by people using any mode of transportation
appropriate for the context may be granted through a development agreement or
similar method, and the developer shall be responsible for providing a
financial guarantee for the future closure of the driveway.
   (3)   Frontage/Backage And Local Access Service Roads: A frontage/backage
road is an access road that generally parallels an arterial between the
arterial and the front building setback line, or behind a building. A frontage/
backage road provides direct lot access to private properties while separating
them from the principal roadway. Access on frontage/backage roads may include
access by pedestrians and people using non-motorized vehicles. (Ord. 3618, 8-5-
2024)
13-05-05: ACCESS MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SPACING AND DRIVEWAY SEPARATION:
Proper spacing of access points and driveway separation vary with such factors
as street classification, speed limit, distance from intersections that are
either signalized or unsignalized, volume of traffic using a driveway, whether
the driveway is a full movement or restricted movement driveway, along with
other situational factors.
Table 13.1 shows criteria for access spacing and driveway separation for
various factors listed above. Judgment must be applied by professionals and
City staff for unusual circumstances, but the criteria in
Table 13.1 is the applied standard. Variances from the standard must be
justified and approved by the City Engineer.

conditions warrant.
New access points within City adopted corridor plans may be governed by the
requirements of the corridor plan.
 
(Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-06: ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRINCIPAL AND MINOR ARTERIALS:
   (1)   General Considerations:
      A.   Principal arterials serve the major regional centers of activity of
a metropolitan area, higher traffic volume corridors, and longer trips.
Principal arterials carry the major portion of trips entering and leaving the
urban area, as well as the majority of through movements. To preserve the long-
term functionality of such roadways, they should have more access control than
a minor arterial.
      B.   Minor arterials interconnect with and augment the principal arterial
system and provide service to trips of shorter length at a lower level of
travel mobility than principal arterials. Minor arterials also distribute
travel to geographic areas smaller than those identified with the higher
systems. This classification includes all arterials not included in a higher
classification and places more emphasis on land access than principal
arterials. Such roadways should still have limited access with less access
control than a principal arterial, but more than a collector.
      C.   Due to the higher volume of vehicular traffic expected on arterial
roadways, additional care should be taken in providing safe facilities for
bicyclists and pedestrians. The preferred treatment for bicyclists and
pedestrians is a multi-use path. In some situations, alternative facilities may
be used based on existing roadway and land use conditions. City staff will
identify the bike and pedestrian facility that will be required through
development. For purposes of this policy, a multi-use path qualifies as a side
path as defined in Idaho Code.
   (2)   Access Points:
      A.   All access points associated with development applications shall be
determined in accordance with the policies in this Article 5, Access Management
Standards for City Streets. Access points shall be reviewed only for a
development application that is being considered. Approved access points may be
relocated and/or restricted in the future if the land use intensifies, changes,
or the property redevelops. Notwithstanding any provision herein, the City
Engineer may approve access to be taken off of higher classified streets to
support corresponding land use plans, if it is found that allowing such access
does not reduce the safety of users of the public rights-of-way.
      B.   If an application does not substantially increase the intensity of
use, and no reasonable alternative exists to reduce or eliminate the
deficiency, the City Engineer may allow the deficient driveway approach to be
retained at the same location.
   (3)   Signalized Collector Street Intersection Spacing On Minor And
Principal Arterials:
      A.   The optimum spacing for new signalized collector roadways
intersecting minor arterials is one half-mile. In order to maintain the
function of the arterial street system, the goal is to allow no more than one
signal per mile (with connectivity within the square mile to that signal
location). The spacing of signalized intersections on arterials is critical to
traffic progression and the optimization of the arterial street system.
      B.   Deviations from the ½ mile spacing may be considered:
         1.   To accommodate the design and layout of an existing collector
street system.
         2.   Within existing central business districts.
         3.   If specified by an adopted corridor study or specific area plan.
         4.   If there are no other reasonable site design, access or
circulation alternatives eliminating the need for a signal; and if there is a
proven public necessity for the intersection; and a traffic signal study and
traffic analysis reviewed and approved by the City verifies the need.
   (4)   Local Street Intersection Spacing On Arterials: New local streets
should not typically intersect arterials. Local streets should typically
intersect collectors. If it is necessary, as determined by the City, for a
local street to intersect an arterial, the minimum allowable offset shall be as
identified in
Table 13.1.
   (5)   Number Of Driveways On Arterials: The intent of this policy is to
limit the number of access points to those that are warranted or necessary to
serve the development, while maintaining the function and performance of the
arterial. The guidelines below shall be used when more than one access point is
being requested with a development.
      Additional driveways may be considered when one or more of the following
conditions are met:
      A.   The daily volume using one driveway exceeds five thousand (5,000)
vehicles (total volume for entering and exiting traffic).
      B.   Traffic using one driveway exceeds the volume to capacity ratio (v/
c) equal to or greater than 1.0 of a STOP controlled intersection during either
the peak hour of the street or the peak hour of the site traffic generation.
      C.   A City approved traffic impact study and analysis determines that
conditions warrant additional driveways.
   (6)   Driveway Spacing On Minor Arterials From Existing Or Future Signalized
Intersections: To determine if there is a single or dual left turn lane
planned, refer to the most recently adopted Caldwell Area Transportation System
Plan. If the intersection is not listed in that plan, then assume a single left
turn lane. Dimensions shall be measured from the centerline of the intersection
to the centerline of the driveway.
   (7)   Single Left Turn Lane: If a driveway is approved by the City based on
the policies listed above, then driveways located near a signalized
intersection with an existing or planned single left turn lane shall be
located:
      A.   A minimum of three hundred thirty feet (330') from the intersection
for a right-in/right-out driveway; and
      B.   A minimum of six hundred sixty feet (660') from the intersection for
a full-movement driveway.
   (8)   Dual Left Turn Lane: Driveways located near a signalized intersection
with an existing or planned dual left turn lane shall be located:
      A.   A minimum of three hundred feet (330') from the intersection for a
right-in/right-out driveway; and
      B.   A minimum of seven hundred ten feet (710') from the intersection for
a full-movement driveway.
   (9)   Driveway Spacing On Minor Arterials (Away From A Signalized
Intersection):
      A.   Direct lot or parcel access to a minor arterial is typically
prohibited.
      B.   If a property has frontage on more than one street, access shall be
taken from the street having the lesser functional classification.
      C.   Driveways located on an arterial may be prohibited when the property
has frontage on one or more other public streets.
      D.   For property with frontage on more than one street, access shall be
provided from the street having the lower current or projected Average Daily
Traffic Volume (ADT), and/or the lesser functionally classified street (i.e.,
frontage on arterial and collector, access shall be from collector). The City
shall determine which street has the lower volume.
      If it is necessary to take access to the higher classified street due to
a lack of frontage, the minimum allowable spacing shall be based on
Table 13.1. The spacing shall be measured from all other existing or approved
driveways or intersecting streets on either side of the Minor Arterial.
   (10)   Driveway Spacing On Principal Arterials:
      A.   Direct lot or parcel access to a principal arterial is typically
prohibited.
      B.   If a property has frontage on more than one street, access shall be
taken from the street having the lesser functional classification.
      C.   Driveways located on arterials may be prohibited when the property
has frontage on one or more other public streets.
      D.   For property with frontage on more than one street, access shall be
provided from the street having the lower current and projected Average Daily
Traffic Volume (ADT), and/or the lesser functionally classified street (i.e.,
frontage on arterial and collector, access shall be from collector). The City
shall determine which road has the lower volume.
      E.   If it is necessary to take access to the higher classified street
due to a lack of frontage, the minimum allowable spacing shall be based on
Table 13.1. The spacing shall be measured from any other existing or approved
driveway or street on either side of the street.
      F.   Driveways, when approved on a principal arterial shall operate as
right- in/right-out only. The City will require the construction of a raised
median in the principal arterial to restrict the left turning movements on the
principal arterial. Deceleration/right-turn lanes may be required by the City,
even if a traffic impact study does not warrant it.
      G.   The City may consider a temporary full access driveway when the
following conditions are met:
         1.   It is a single lane principal arterial (one lane in each
direction of travel); and
         2.   The road has less than 24,000 ADT; or
         3.   Traffic safety, operations and site conditions provide reasonable
access to a parcel without placing an undue burden on the surrounding road
network, as determined by the City. The City Engineer shall have authority to
grant temporary full access under this policy, upon first making findings of
fact, and conclusions based thereon, that:
            a.   A parcel of real property proposed for development is so
unusual in size, shape, location and/or physical condition that strict
enforcement of one or more of the access standards contained in this policy
would result in extraordinary economic and design hardships and practical
difficulties, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience; and
            b.   Modifications of such standards will not jeopardize pedestrian
and motorist safety or otherwise be injurious to other adjacent property or
detrimental to public safety, health, or welfare; and
            c.   Conditions for the request for modification are unique to the
property for which the modification is sought and are not applicable generally
to other property; and
            d.   The modification will not contravene the overall intent or
effect of this policy.
         4.   If granted, temporary access will be administered per Section
13-05-04(2) (Temporary Access). (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-07: ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS FOR COLLECTOR STREETS:
   (1)   General Considerations For Collector Streets:
      A.   The primary function of a collector is to intercept traffic from the
local street system and carry that traffic to the nearest arterial. A secondary
function is to service adjacent property. Access will be limited or controlled.
      B.   Due to the higher volume of vehicular traffic expected on collector
roadways, additional care should be taken in providing safe facilities for
bicyclists and pedestrians.
   (2)   Access Points:
      A.   All access points associated with development applications shall be
determined in accordance with the policies in this Article 5, Access Management
Standards for City Streets. Access points shall be reviewed only for a
development application that is being considered. Approved access points may be
relocated and/or restricted in the future if the land use intensifies, changes,
or the property redevelops.
      B.   If an application does not substantially increase the intensity of
use, and no reasonable alternative exists to reduce or eliminate the
deficiency, the City Engineer may allow the deficient driveway approach to be
retained at the same location.
   (3)   Signalized Intersection Spacing on Collectors. The preferred spacing
for new collectors intersecting existing collectors is 1/4 mile to allow for
adequate signal spacing and alignment. Access points on a collector that
require signalization shall be public streets.
   (4)   Driveway Spacing On Collectors Near Existing Or Future Signalized
Intersections And Roundabouts: Access is typically prohibited within the
influence area of the intersection. For roundabouts, the area of influence is
generally considered the area from the intersection to the far end of the
splitter islands.
   (5)   Driveways located near a signalized intersection shall be located in
accordance with one of the following, whichever is greater:
      A.   Outside the area of influence; or
      B.   Two hundred twenty feet (220') for a right-in/right-out driveway and
four hundred forty feet (440') for a full-movement driveway.
      Dimensions shall be measured from the centerline of the intersection to
the centerline of the driveway.
   (6)   Driveway Spacing On Collectors Near Stop-Controlled Intersections:
Access is typically prohibited within the influence area of the intersection.
For roundabouts, the area of influence is generally considered the area from
the intersection to the far end of the splitter islands.
   (7)   Driveways located near a STOP controlled intersection shall be located
in accordance with one of the following, whichever is greater:
      A.   Outside the area of influence; or
      B.   One hundred fifty feet (150').
      Dimensions shall be measured from the centerline of the intersection to
the centerline of the driveway.
   (8)   Driveway Spacing On Collectors (Away From A Signalized Intersection):
Access restrictions to collectors shall be based upon the type of access that
is being proposed according to
Table 13.1. The spacing shall be measured from any other existing or approved
driveway or street on either side of the street. (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-08: ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS FOR LOCAL STREETS:
   (1)   General Considerations For Local Streets: The primary function of a
local (residential) street is to serve adjacent property. Adjacent property
will usually have unrestricted access to the street and ADT will typically be
less than two thousand (2,000). Access to local streets is generally
unrestricted, except near intersections.
   (2)   Driveway Spacing:
      A.   Near Intersections: Driveways on a local street shall be located a
minimum of seventy five feet (75') (measured centerline to centerline) from the
nearest local street intersection, and one hundred fifty feet (150') from the
nearest collector or arterial street intersection. This is not applicable for
single family dwelling units.
      B.   Successive Driveways: Away from an intersection there are no minimum
spacing requirements for access points along a local street, but the City does
encourage shared access points where appropriate.
   (3)   Local Street Intersections: Local streets intersecting other local
streets shall either align with another street or provide a minimum offset of
one hundred twenty five feet (125') from any other street (measured centerline
to centerline). (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
13-05-09: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   (1)   Any party aggrieved by a decision of the City Engineer in
administering Caldwell access management standards provided for herein may
appeal said decision to the City Council by filing a written notice of such
appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date of such decision
except that such appeal shall be applicable only to items at the City
Engineer's discretion as granted herein.
   (2)   Appeals to the City Council shall be processed as a Contested Case,
pursuant to Caldwell City Code
01-05-11. (Ord. 3618, 8-5-2024)
