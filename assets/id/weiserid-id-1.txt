4-4-1: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Whereas the legislature of the state of Idaho has in Idaho Code sections 46-
1020 through 46-1024 delegated the responsibility to local government units to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry; and whereas the city council finds:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the city of Weiser are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses are caused by the accumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-2: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; reduce the annual cost of flood insurance; and minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To protect human life and health;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;

area of special flood hazard;
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-3: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)

rate map (FIRM). AO zones have base flood depths that range from one to three
feet (1 - 3') above the natural ground; a clearly defined channel does not
exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity
flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow; AH indicates ponding,
and is shown with standard base flood elevations.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: Land in the floodplain within a community subject
to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the adopted floodplain management regulations.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).

insurance administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-
floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The usual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that shall correspond to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance flood (100-year flood) plus any
increased flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any freeboard.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain
adjoining the channel required to discharge and store the floodwater or flood
flows associated with the regulatory flood.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements found at subsection
4-4-13-1B of this chapter (i.e., provided there are adequate flood ventilation
openings).

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known
to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular
stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based
upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed
or analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In inland
areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once every one hundred
(100) years; this means that any given year there is a one percent (1%) chance
that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before damage occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Before the improvement or repair is started; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The term can exclude:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct precited
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been previously identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or a state inventory of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
WATER DEPENDENT: A structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any
other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature
of its operations. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the city of Weiser. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-6: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study For Washington County, Idaho And Incorporated Areas" dated June
16, 2009, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. The flood
insurance study and the FIRM are on file at Weiser City Hall, 55 West Idaho
Street, Weiser, Idaho. The best available information for flood hazard area
identification as outlined in subsection
4-4-11-4B of this chapter shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is
issued that incorporates data utilized under subsection
4-4-11-4B of this chapter. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-7: PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions), shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) or imprisoned for not more than
thirty (30) days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-8: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1211, 5-
11-2009)
4-4-9: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Considered as minimum requirements;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-10: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-11: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:

permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of subsection 4-4-15A of this chapter are met.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use Of Other Base Flood Data (In A Zone): When base flood elevation
data has not been provided (in A zones) in accordance with section
4-4-6, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer sections
4-4-13, "Specific Standards", and
4-4-15, "Floodways", of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study, FIRM, or required as in subsection B of this section, obtain
and record the actual (as built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of
the lowest flood (including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. Recorded on a
current elevation certificate (FF 81-31) with section B completed by the local
official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential

Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Notify adjacent communities and the department of water resources
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of
such notification to the federal insurance administration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where needed,
as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards
(e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such
appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of section 60.6 of the
rules and regulations of the national flood insurance program. (Ord. 1211, 5-
11-2009)
4-4-11-5: VARIANCE PROCEDURE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeal Board: The city council as established by ordinance shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
city in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Those aggrieved by the decision of the city council or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the district court, as provided by Idaho Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conditions For Variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historical places
or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to procedures set
forth in this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A showing of good and sufficient cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
variances from flood elevations should be quite rare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection B1 of
this section, and otherwise complies with sections
4-4-12-1,
4-4-12-3, and
4-4-12-4 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below
the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required.
(Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-1: ANCHORING:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and
practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are
not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. (Ord.
1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-2: AH ZONE DRAINAGE:
Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-3: CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the
base flood elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.
(Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-4: UTILITIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the
floodway;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-5: SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damages;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less). (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-12-6: REVIEW OF BUILDING PERMITS:
Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study,
FIRM, or from another authoritative source (subsection 4-4-11-4B of this
chapter), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that
proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of
reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high
water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to
elevate at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-13: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
4-4-6, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter or subsection

flood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The interior of a crawl space below the flood protection elevation
(FPE) must not be more than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent exterior
grade (LAG) and the height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the
interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation must
not exceed four feet (4') at any point.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Below grade, crawl spaces constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
However, applicants who construct buildings that have below grade crawl spaces
are hereby advised that such buildings will have higher flood insurance
premiums than buildings that have crawl spaces with interior elevations at or
above the lowest adjacent grade. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-13-2: NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or
other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the flood protection elevation (FPE); or,

In areas with flood protection elevations (FPE) (but a regulatory floodway has
not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on
the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-
2009)
4-4-15: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
4-4-6 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry
debris, and increase erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of sections
4-4-12 through
4-4-15 of this chapter. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-16: STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING AREAS (AO ZONES):
Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The
base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet (1 - 3')
aboveground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following
provisions apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures
and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, to or
above the flood protection elevation (FPE) (at least 2 feet if no depth number
is specified on the FIRM).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures within AO zones shall either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Have the lowest floor (including basement elevated above the highest
adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE) (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified on the FIRM).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that
level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is
used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as in subsection 4-4-13-2C of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO zones on the
community's FIRM either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Be on the site for fewer that one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Meet requirements of this section and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-17: CRITICAL FACILITY:
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) (100-year
floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible
within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical
facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated
three feet (3') above the flood protection elevation (FPE) or to the height of
the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical
facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing
and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the level of the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be provided to all
critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1211, 5-11-2009)
4-4-18: SEVERABILITY:

drain. The owner shall install backflow preventers or check valves on the
drains and sewers where the drainage piping serves fixtures which have flood
level rims located below the elevation of the next upstream manhole cover of
the Weiser public sewer system. Drainage piping shall be protected from
backflow of sewer by installing an approved type backwater valve on the owner's
property. Failure on the part of any owner to properly maintain the backflow
preventer or check valve, or to cause such an installation to be made will
relieve the city from all responsibility for any and all damages suffered by
said owner as a result of a backflow of sewage onto said property owner's real
property and appurtenant structures. (Ord. 1154, 11-10-2003)
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Inspection And Approval By City: No sewer connection to any premises

"slugs" as defined herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment plant effluent but cannot meet the requirements of other
agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Rejection Or Handling Harmful Wastes: If any water or wastes are
discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters
contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this
section, and which in the judgment of the sewer plant supervisor may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewerage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Reject the wastes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;

special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Special Agreements, Arrangements: No statement contained in this
chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment;

residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to
interfere with the reclamation process. (In no case shall a substance
discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the
act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use on disposal
developed pursuant to the solid waste disposal act, the clean air act, the
toxic substance control act, or state standards applicable to the sludge
management method being used.)

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Other Limitations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Categorical Pretreatment Standards: Categorical pretreatment
standards as promulgated by the environmental protection agency pursuant to the
act shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories. The
categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N,
parts 405-471, are hereby incorporated. An application for modification of the
categorical pretreatment standards may be considered for submittal to the
approval authority by the city, when the city's wastewater treatment system
achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR section
403.7.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â State Requirements: State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in
any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations, or those in this chapter or other applicable ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Right Of Revision: The city reserves the right to amend this chapter
or an industrial wastewater permit to provide for more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with
the objectives set forth in subsection 7-6-1A of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Dilution: No discharger shall, without written approval of the
superintendent, increase the use of potable or process water in any way, nor
mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
standards set forth in this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Mass Limitations: The city may impose mass limitations on
dischargers which are using dilution to meet the pretreatment standards or
requirements of this chapter or, in other cases, where the imposition of mass
limitations is deemed appropriate by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Special Agreements: The city reserves the right to enter into
special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement.
However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the
categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority. Such a request
will be approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
establishing that categorical pretreatment standard. A user requesting a
fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Wastewater Treatment: User shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this
chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state or the
city, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review,
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Compliance: Compliance by existing user (categorical users) covered
by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the
date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in
the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline
date for any existing significant industrial user (SIU) not covered by
categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local
limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â New Source Dischargers: New source dischargers and "new users" (that
fit the definition of SIU) are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days from the
beginning of discharge). New sources and "new users" shall install and have in
operating condition and shall "start up" all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Compliance Date: Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a

Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Wastewater Discharge Permit Conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Reassignment Or Transfer Of Permits: Wastewater discharge permits
may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner and/or operator only if the
permittee gives at least thirty (30) days' advance notice to the superintendent
and the superintendent approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The
notice to the superintendent must include a written certification by the new
owner and/or operator which:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate
intent to change the facility's operations and processes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to
occur; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the
existing wastewater discharge permit.
Provided that the above occurs and that there were no significant changes to
the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner will be
considered an existing user and be covered by the existing limits and
requirements in the previous owner's permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of transfer renders the wastewater discharge
permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Duty To Reapply: The city shall notify the discharger ninety (90)
days prior to the expiration of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
Within thirty (30) days of the notification, the discharger shall reapply for
reissuance of the wastewater discharge permit on a form provided by the city. A
user, whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and has submitted
its reapplication in the time period specified herein, shall be deemed to have
an effective wastewater permit until the city issues or denies the new
wastewater permit. A user, whose existing wastewater discharge permit has
expired and who failed to submit its reapplication in the time period specified
herein, will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater discharge permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Severability: The provisions of a wastewater discharge permit are
severable, and if any provision of this wastewater discharge permit, or the
application of any provision of this permit to any circumstance is held
invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and the
remainder of this permit shall not be affected thereby.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Property Rights: The issuance of a wastewater discharge permit
does not convey any property rights in either real or personal property, or any
exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any invasion of personal rights,
nor any infringement of federal, state or local regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Permit Holders Outside City Limits: All permit holders outside
the city limits shall be subject to all the same sewer use regulations as
permit holders inside the city limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Inspection And Sampling Points: The city may require inspection
and sampling manholes, flow recording devices, or sampling equipment at each
sewer discharge to the city if deemed necessary by the superintendent to assure
compliance with this chapter. The superintendent may require the construction
and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the
end of a manufacturing line, or wastewater treatment system). All devices used
to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals: Any person, including the user,
may petition the city to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit
within ninety (90) days of its issuance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to
be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection and the
alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be
stayed pending the appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a
wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not
to modify a wastewater discharge permit, shall be considered final
administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharger permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the district court for Washington County within the state of
Idaho.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification: The superintendent may
modify the wastewater discharge permit for good cause including, but not
limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â To address significant alterations or additions to the user's
operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the time of
wastewater discharge permit issuance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or
permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the city POTW, city personnel or the receiving waters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â n.Â Â Â If the city has to invoke its emergency provision as stated in
section
7-6-7 of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Compliance Schedules For Meeting Applicable Pretreatment Standards:
Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will
be required to comply with this chapter, the discharger shall provide a
declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional operational and
maintenance activities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment equipment required for the discharger to comply with
the requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, dates relating
to hiring an engineer, hiring other appropriate personnel, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, and all other
acts necessary to achieve compliance with this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Only upon recommendation of the board of sewer appraisers and
approval of the city council shall the city permit a time increment directed
toward compliance to exceed nine (9) months. Categorical industrial users shall
not be allowed to exceed nine (9) months for a compliance schedule increment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Not later than fourteen (14) days following each milestone date in
the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a
progress report to the city, including no less than a statement as to whether
or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by the milestone
date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of
progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to
return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than
nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the city.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reporting Requirements For Discharger:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Compliance Date Report: Within ninety (90) days following the
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new
discharger, any discharger subject to this chapter shall upon request of the
superintendent submit to the city a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. In the case of
categorical dischargers, the flows and pollutant concentrations (or mass) of
the wastestreams from processes regulated under categorical standards must be
reported separately. This report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
discharger into compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the discharger with the following certification:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Periodic Compliance Reports:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Reports: Any discharger subject to any applicable pretreatment
standard set forth in this chapter, after compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or in the case of a new user after commencement of discharge to the
city, shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the city, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows
during the reporting period reported in subsection D1 of this section. Flows
shall be reported based on actual measurement, provided, however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the city may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The city, for good cause
shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of
said reports on months other than those specified above. A certification
statement signed by an authorized representative of the discharger is required
as a part of the periodic compliance reports for categorical users (see
subsection D1a of this section).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Reports To Determine Charges: The city may require reporting by
users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit
if information or data is needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the
treatability of the effluent or determine any other factor which is related to
the operation and maintenance of the sewer system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Self-Monitoring: The city may require self-monitoring by the user
or, if requested by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance
monitoring needed to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this
section. If the city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it
may charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the
city for sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal
sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under
no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Report Contents: Reports of dischargers shall contain all results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration of regulated pollutants, or production and mass where
required by the city. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as
prescribed by the city but not less than twice a year unless the city agrees to
sample instead. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the city pursuant to section 304(g) of the act and contained in
40 CFR part 136, in subsection I of this section and amendments thereto, or
with any other test procedures approved by the city. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the city and shall be
representative of wastewater discharges during the reporting period. Where 40
CFR part 136, does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutants in question, or where the city determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods, or
any other sampling and analytical procedures including procedures suggested by
the city or other parties approved by the city. A certification statement
signed by an authorized representative of the discharger is required as a part
of the periodic compliance reports for categorical users (see subsection D1a of
this section).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Notification Of Significant Production Changes: Any user
operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business days after
the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a
notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing
limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Notice Of Potential Problems Including Accidental Spills And/Or
Slug Loadings: Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges
that could cause problems to the POTW including any slug loadings as defined in
section
7-6-3 of this chapter. The notification shall include the concentration and
volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact
should also be noted during the notification. Any user who discharged a "slug"
(or slugs) of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or
damage to the POTW in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city
under state or federal law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Noncompliance Reporting: If sampling performed by a user
indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within twenty four (24)
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling within five (5) days and submit the results of the repeat analysis to
the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except
the user is not required to resample if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The city performs sampling at the user's facility at a
frequency of at least once per month, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city performs sampling at the user's facility between the
time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Notification Of Changed Discharge: All users shall promptly
notify the city in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character
of pollutants in their discharge, including significant manufacturing process
changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR
403.12 (p).
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recordkeeping: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the superintendent.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Monitoring Facilities: Each discharger shall provide and operate, at
the discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of each wastewater discharge to the sewer. Each
monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except
where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
discharger; the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility is located so that
it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The city, whenever
applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities
at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater
treatment system). All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. All devices
used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a frequency
determined by the city to ensure their accuracy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of receipt
of the permit by the discharger.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Inspection And Sampling: The city shall have the right to enter the
facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and
any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and
whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow
the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying and the performance of
any additional duties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the city will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Unreasonable delays in allowing the city's pretreatment staff access
to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Sampling Requirements For Users:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, fats, oils and greases, sulfide and volatile organics. The city
will determine on a case by case basis whether the user may be able to
composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional
composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow
proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow
proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained
through time proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of
eight (8) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or as determined by the city
and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users,
if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastes formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. For other SIUs,
for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows,
the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate
compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than
what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, it must submit all
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self-
monitoring report.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Analytical Requirements: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in
40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in questions, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in subsections
H and I of this section for sampling and analyzing industrial user's
wastewater.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Search Warrants: If the city pretreatment staff has been refused access
to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
superintendent shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure warrant from the
magistrate division of the district court. Such warrant shall be served at
reasonable hours by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the city of Weiser.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Confidential Information: Information and data furnished to the city
with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the
public without restriction unless the discharger specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the
discharger.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by the city until, and unless, a ten (10) day
notification is given to the discharger, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for use related to the NPDES
program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Pretreatment Facilities: Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities shall be submitted to the city for review, and must be acceptable to
the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans shall in
no way relieve the discharger from the responsibility of modifying its facility
as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions
of this chapter. Within a reasonable time after the completion of the
wastewater pretreatment facility, the discharger shall furnish its operation
and maintenance procedures for the city to review. Any subsequent, significant
changes in the pretreatment facility or its method of operation shall be
reported to and accepted by the city prior to the discharger's initiation of
the changes.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Hazardous Waste Notification: Any user that is discharging fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or
characteristic wastes) in a calendar month or any facility discharging any
amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e) is required to provide a onetime notification in writing to the city, EPA
regional waste management division director, and to the Idaho state hazardous
materials bureau. Any existing user exempt from this notification shall comply
with the requirements contained herein within thirty (30) days of becoming
aware of a discharge of fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes in a
calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the POTW.
Such notification shall include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The EPA hazardous waste number; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100)
kilograms of such wastes per calendar month to the sewer system, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent it is
known or readily available to the industrial user:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste streams discharged during that calendar month; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste streams
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported
under self-monitoring requirements. Whenever the EPA publishes final rules
identifying hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a use
shall notify the city of the discharge of such a substance within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of such regulations. In the case of any notification
made under subsection M4 of this section, an industrial user shall certify that
it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. (Ord.
1090, 8-24-1999)
7-6-7: RIGHT OF ENTRY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Inspection and Sampling: the Superintendent shall have the right to
enter the premises of any User to determine whether the User is complying with
all requirements of this chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises. The User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that. upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent shall be permitted to either
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the User's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the User's operations.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Superintendent may require the User to install monitoring equipment
as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at
its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall
be calibrated as per manufacture recommendations to ensure their accuracy.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be impacted and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the User at
the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the User.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the User's
premises shall be a violation of this section. (Ord. 1266, 4-10-2023)
7-6-8: ENFORCEMENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Emergency Suspension Of Service And Wastewater Discharge Permit: The
city may, without advance notice, order the suspension of the wastewater
treatment service to a discharger when it appears to the city that an actual or
threatened discharge:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the
health or welfare of persons, or substantial danger to the environment. Any
discharger notified by the city's suspension order shall immediately cease all
discharges. In the event of failure of the dischargers to comply with the
suspension order, the city is authorized to physically prevent the discharge
from entering the public owned sewerage collection system, and assess all costs
associated therewith to the discharger.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or to violate
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
city's suspension order shall immediately cease all discharges. In the event of
failure of the discharger to comply with the suspension order, the city may
commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's
specific compliance with such order and/or to recover civil penalties. The city
shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof by the discharger
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the
threat as set forth above.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Termination Of Treatment Services: The city may terminate wastewater
treatment services to any discharger who violates any of the following
prohibitions. A discharger shall not:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Fail to factually report accurately the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Fail to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Refuse responsible access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the city for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Violate the provisions of this chapter, or any order of the city
with respect thereto.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Compliance Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time
specified in the order. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Compliance Schedule For Meeting Applicable Pretreatment Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No increment referred to in subsection D1 of this section shall
exceed nine (9) months.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â No later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to
the superintendent including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Notices Of Violation: When the city finds that a user has violated (or
continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the city may serve that user a written notice of violation (NOV).
If required, within five (5) working days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the city. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Consent Orders: The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Cease And Desist Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Show Cause Hearing: Where the violation of section
7-6-4 of this chapter is not corrected in adherence to compliance orders or any
other enforcement action in a timely manner, the city may order any discharger
which suffers or permits a violation of section
7-6-4 of this chapter to show cause before the city or its duly authorized
representative why the proposed service termination action should not be taken.
A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service, or
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and
place of a hearing to be held by the city or its designee regarding the
violation; the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken; the proposed
enforcement action; and directing the discharger to show cause before the city
or its designee why the enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
the hearing shall be served no less than ten (10) days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of a
discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the city,
which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged
violations of the discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the
discharger in accordance with applicable local or state law.
Â Â Â A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Judicial Proceedings: Following the entry of any order by the city with
respect to the violation by a discharger of subsection B of this section, the
city may commence in an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in
the appropriate local court.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Annual Publication: An annual publication of all SIUs in significant
noncompliance (SAC) shall be made in the largest daily newspaper published in
the city. This publication will summarize the enforcement actions taken against
dischargers which have had a pattern of noncompliance during the previous
twelve (12) months. For the purpose of this provision, a user is in SAC if its
violation(s) meets one or more of the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Wastewater Discharge Violations: Chronic violations of wastewater
discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or
more of wastewater measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed the
daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any
amount;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violations: Technical review
criteria violations, defined here as those in which thirty three percent (33%)
or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a
six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease,
and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Other Discharges: Any other discharge violation that the city
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass-through (including endangering the health of city
personnel or the general public);
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Imminent Endangerment: Any discharge of pollutants that has caused
imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in
the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Compliance Schedule: Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the
scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Reports Required: Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after
the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports,
reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Noncompliance: Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Other Violations: Any other violation(s) which the city determines
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Right Of Appeal: Any discharger or any interested party shall have the
right to request, in writing, an interpretation or ruling by the city on any
matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt, written
reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters
of performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity
relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's
request shall not stay enforcement proceedings pending. Appeal of any final
judicial order entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with
the local and state law.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Operating Upsets: For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond
the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventative maintenance,
or careless or improper operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection L2 of this section are met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A user who wishes to establish an affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â An upset occurred and that the user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The user has submitted the following information to the city
within twenty four (24) hours becoming aware of the upset (if this information
is submitted orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 days):
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent occurrence of the noncompliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the treatment
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies to the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Falsifying Information: Any person who knowingly makes a false
statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report,
plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
chapter; or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall (in addition to
civil and/or criminal penalties provided by state law) be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be prosecuted and punished by fines and/or imprisonment.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Injunctive Relief: When the superintendent finds a user has violated
(or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the superintendent may petition the third district court through
the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 1090, 8-24-1999)
7-6-9: PENALTIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Administrative Penalties: Any discharger who violates an order of the
city, or who fails to comply with any provision of this chapter, or any
regulations, rules, or permits of the city, issued pursuant to this chapter,
shall be liable to the city for an administrative penalty.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The amount of such administrative penalty shall be not less than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per violation nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or
continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of a monthly or
other long term average discharge limit, the penalties shall accrue for each
day during the period of the violation. The superintendent is authorized to
levy fines and penalties. The superintendent shall have authority to suspend up
to eighty percent (80%) of an administrative penalty at his discretion.
Â Â Â In determining the amount of the administrative penalty the superintendent
shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited
to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Civil Penalties: Any discharger who violates an order of the city, or
who fails to comply with any provision of this chapter, or any regulations,
rules or permits of the city, issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be liable
to the city for a civil penalty.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The amount of such civil penalty shall not exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or
continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of a monthly or
other long term average discharge limit, the penalties shall accrue for each
day during the period of the violation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The city may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Appeals: Users desiring to dispute such penalty must file a written
request for the city to reconsider the penalty along with full payment of the
penalty within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the penalty. Where a
request has merit, the city shall convene a hearing with the board of sewer
appraisers on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request from
the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may

8-6-1: RATES; CHARGES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Adopted: It is hereby declared and past experience has demonstrated
that the rates to consumers for water, sewer, garbage and electric service is a
subject of frequent change of price of service and manner of payment for
service, amount of meter deposits and whether or not penalties should be
attached for failure to pay service charges by fixed dates, and it is declared
policy of the mayor and council that such schedules, amount of meter deposits
and provisions for penalties should be elastic in the sense that they may be
changed without the necessity of enacting a new ordinance, and it is hereby
ordained that the schedule of rates for water and electric service, amount of
meter deposits and penalties shall hereafter be such as may from time to time
be adopted by the council by motion or resolution. Until a different schedule
is established by the council, the charges of the city to its customers for
electric service shall be the same as is now charged by the Idaho Power Company
to its customers for electric service in towns or cities of similar size in the
territory in which Weiser is situated. The rate schedule for water, sewer and
garbage service, until a new schedule is adopted by the council, shall be the
same as is now in effect and provided in the schedule contained on customersâ
bills that are now being used in mailing to customers their monthly bills.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Paying Of Bills: Bills for water, sewer, garbage and electric service
shall be rendered by and paid to the city clerk in the manner determined by the
mayor and council.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Utility Bills: The city utility bills will be billed in one (1) billing
cycle. The city utility bills will be mailed on the thirtieth day of each
month, they will be delinquent on the fifteenth day of the following month. Any
payments made after the fifteenth day of the month, shall incur a late fee of
fifteen dollars ($15.00). If the fifteenth falls on a holiday or weekend, the
payment must be made by the following business day. Any utilities not paid in
full by eight oâclock (8:00) A.M. on the twenty-third day will be disconnected.
If the twenty-third falls on a holiday or weekend utilities would be
disconnected the following business day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Delinquent notices and shutoff tags will no longer be sent out by the
city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â If utilities are disconnected, there will be a disconnect fee of twenty
dollars ($20.00) and a reconnect fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). The current
bill and any fees must be paid in full before the service will be reconnected.
There is an after-hours fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) between the hours of
five oâclock (5:00) P.M. and eight oâclock (8:00) A.M., and on weekends and
holidays.
Â Â Â Â Â Â The city clerk may, at his/her discretion, extend the payment due date
under special situations. These situations may include serious injury, illness
or death in the immediate family.
Â Â Â Â Â Â There will be a five-dollar ($5.00) charge for this extension, in
addition to the fifteen dollar ($15.00) late penalty. This extension will be a
written agreement. No verbal agreements will be accepted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â If an owner/occupant turns on or tampers with an electric/water meter
after service has been shut off by the city, the service will not be restored
until a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) has been paid in full by the owner or
occupant of the property, in addition to any other late, disconnect and
reconnect fees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â When there is one water meter for a multi-family house or multiple units,
the water and sewer billing shall be in the real property ownerâs name. The
real property owner is responsible for payment. Default in payment will result
in the water being shut off at the meter for all building units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Should a meter fail for any reason, the city will charge an amount based
upon the history of usage of the meter and customer. The city clerk shall
determine the amounts to be charged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Where there is a specific request to have a meter turned on and off for
testing or any other reason, there shall be a service charge of twenty dollars
($20.00) paid before the service can be provided. No charge if there is an
emergency request but shall be approved by the mayor or clerk coordinator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Service deposits shall be paid as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A one-hundred-dollar ($100.00) service deposit shall be paid by each
residential user of city services. After one year of good pay history, the
customer may request one-half (1/2) of their service deposit applied to their
utility bill, by signing an application.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Each large business shall pay a service deposit from two hundred
dollars to five hundred dollars ($200.00 - $500.00), depending upon the extent
of use of the cityâs utilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any customer having a poor payment record with the city shall pay a
service deposit of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) (nonrefundable until off
service). Service shall not be resumed until the delinquent bill has been fully
paid and a new service deposit collected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Any customer whose check is returned for nonsufficient funds will be
charged twenty- five dollars ($25.00). (Ord. 841, 2-10-1975; amd. 1987 Code;
Res. 526, 10-12-2004; Ord. 1270, 8-12-2024)

8-6-3: TAMPERING WITH EQUIPMENT:
It is hereby unlawful for any person except the city superintendent and
employees under his charge or direction to tamper with or connect or disconnect
any water or light service connections to consumers or in any way interfere or
molest any part of the water, sewer and electric distribution service. The
mayor and council may, from time to time by motion or resolution, adopt rules
and regulations for connecting and disconnecting service to customers for
failure to pay bills each month by stated times as fixed in such rules and
regulations adopted by the mayor and council from time to time. It shall be
unlawful for any person, other than an authorized officer or employee of the
city, after service has been disconnected to any consumer of water, sewer or
electric service, to turn the same back on. (Ord. 391, 5-20-1941)
8-6-4: DISPUTED BILLS; TEST OF METERS:
A dispute by a customer as to the correctness of any bill rendered shall not
justify the customer in refusing to pay the bill when the same becomes due, but
if the customer does question a bill, then he shall protest to the city clerk,
giving his reasons for questioning the amount of the bill, and then the city
superintendent shall cause investigation to be made, and if it is determined
that the meter measuring the service is not accurate, then proper adjustment
shall be made and credit or refund made to the customer, but no such dispute
shall justify the customer in connecting up a service that has been
disconnected for failure to pay a bill when due. When complaint is made that
any meter is not correctly measuring the amount of water or electricity
delivered to the consumer, then investigation shall be made and if, in the
opinion of the city superintendent, a test of the meter should be made, then he
shall cause the same to be tested if he finds that circumstances seem to
warrant or justify such a test. (Ord. 491, 5-20-1941)
8-6-5: GENERAL REGULATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Rules And Regulations On File: Unless otherwise provided in this code,
rules and regulations for the conduct of the several municipally owned
utilities of the city shall be on file with the respective departments and
shall at all times be approved by the mayor and council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Application: Each applicant for the use of the water or sewer systems
or the electrical distribution system shall make application to the city
superintendent or other designated official, and said application, upon
approval thereof, shall be deemed a contract with the city whereby the
applicant agrees to comply with all rules and regulations with respect to such
service. (1971 Code)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Obligations And Liability: The city shall not be liable for any act,
failure or omission caused directly or indirectly by fire, flood, accident or
other casualty, sabotage, strike, litigation, action of any governmental
authority, acts of God or the public enemy or causes beyond the city's control.
Without limitation by the preceding enumeration, the obligation of the city
shall be limited to the use of reasonable diligence in providing sufficient and
continuous service and having used reasonable diligence, the city shall not be
liable to the customer for failure or interruption of service but will endeavor
to remove the cause thereof with reasonable diligence.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Shutdown For Repairs: In the operation and maintenance of its system
for the purpose of making necessary repairs or changes in its transmission or
distribution facilities or to avoid the possibility of damage to the city's
property or to persons or property of others, the city may suspend delivery of
service for such periods as may be necessary, and the city shall not be liable
for any damage or claim of damage attributable to any temporary discontinuance
of service from such causes.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Phase Rotation: The initial starting of motor installations is not
under the control of the city and, therefore, no responsibility for damage due
to incorrect rotation shall rest upon the city. The city will exercise due care
and diligence to maintain the direction of phase rotation constant on
customer's services after it has been once established. This, however, is
impossible to guarantee, and all customers operating installations where
reversal of rotation will cause damage must protect their installations with
suitable phase relay and circuit breaker, and the city shall be in no way
responsible for damage to customer's installation due to reversed rotation.
Auto starters and other suitable starting devices must be provided by the
customer with all motors above five (5) horsepower. All motors starting on
other than light load must be provided with suitable device or be of suitable
type to limit the starting current. No voltage release is recommended as a part
of starting device for a proper protection of customer's equipment. The
customers shall protect their installations of 3-phase equipment against the
failure of a phase and the city shall not be held liable or responsible for any
damage or claims of damage because of a failure of a single phase in a 3-phase
circuit.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Temporary Suspension Of Demand: When the customer is obliged
temporarily to suspend operation due to strike, action of any governmental
authority, acts of God or the public enemy, the customer may procure a
proration of the monthly bill based upon the period of such suspension by
giving immediate written notice to the city, but in no event shall such bill be
prorated or reduced to an amount less than the minimum monthly bill as provided
in the rate schedule; provided, that no such suspension shall affect the
customer's obligation under any term minimum guarantees based upon special
investment of the city to serve the customer. (Ord. 588, 12-16-1943)

city furnished by its water system, by reason of drought, breakdown in the city
water system, malfunctioning thereof or for any other reason, or whenever so
requested by the mayor or city council, the public services committee shall
formulate and recommend to the city council and the mayor a plan for
restricting the use of water or limiting the use thereof by category of users
or in such other form as the committee may consider appropriate, such plan to
remain in effect for the duration of such shortage of water. (Ord. 867, 7-11-

8-6-9: REGULATIONS FOR INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC METERS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In the construction, alteration, remodeling or repair of all houses and
other buildings within the city, the electrical meter shall be left on the
outside wall and in the clear for meter reading.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Meters shall be located on the outside of the building. Only socket
type meters shall be used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Meters shall be mounted five feet six inches (5'6") from the ground
or walkway level. If structural details of the wall prevent this distance,
meters may be mounted not less than five feet (5') nor more than six feet (6')
from the ground.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Conductors from service to meter must be in conduit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A suitable entrance cap shall be used on the upper end of conduit
extending above the meter base and must not be more than two feet (2') from
point of attachment of service wires. Entrance cap shall be above point of
service attachment (NEC 230-51 [c]). Eighteen inches (18") of service entrance
conductor shall be available from entrance cap for a drip loop.

than residential property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All manufactured buildings must meet requirements set forth herein.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The city's present rate schedules are based on the cost for overhead
service. Due to cost for trenching, backfilling, underground cable and
connectors, special transformers, pads and junction boxes, there is more
expense for underground than for overhead service; therefore, the customer
desiring underground service shall pay the difference in cost between overhead
and underground service.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases of temporary electric service from an overhead or underground
system, the same shall be made, installed and constructed substantially in
accordance with diagrams therefor on file with the city clerk and entitled

schools.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Permit better site planning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Provide an incentive of higher density or reduced setback
requirements to the developer in exchange for provision of permanent parks,
open spaces or other amenities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In order to provide locations for well planned developments which
conform with the objectives of this title although they deviate in certain
respects from the zoning map and the district regulations, the planning and
zoning commission has authority to recommend use permit for planned unit
developments provided the developments comply with the regulations prescribed

and small commercial uses, all of which are an integral part of the
development, may be permitted. (1971 Code)
10-13-4: SITE AREA:
The minimum site area of a planned unit development shall be two and five-
tenths (2.5) acres in a commercial zone and five (5) acres in a residential
zone and ten (10) acres in an industrial zone. (1971 Code)
10-13-5: STANDARDS:
Standards of site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, heights of
structures, distances between structures, off street parking and off street
loading facilities and landscaped areas shall in the aggregate be at least
equivalent to the standards prescribed by the regulations for the district in
which the planned unit development is located.
The average population density per net acre shall not exceed that maximum
population density prescribed by the site area regulations or the site area per
dwelling unit regulations for the district in which the planned unit
development is located, subject to the exception that the maximum population
density prescribed for the district be not more than twenty percent (20%) in a
planned unit development on a site of five (5) acres or more. (1971 Code)
10-13-6: PUD PERMIT PROCEDURE:
The regulations prescribed in title 11 of this code (subdivision regulations)
shall control the procedure for making application for a permit for a planned
unit development, the public hearing, the investigation and report, the action
of the planning and zoning commission and the regulations governing lapse of a
permit and the new applications subject to the following exceptions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The application shall be accompanied by a development plan of the
entire planned unit development, drawn to scale and showing the contours of the
site; provisions for drainage of surface waters; watercourses; railroad and
public utility rights of way; streets; driveways; pedestrian walks; off street
parking and off street loading facilities; reservations for public uses,
including parks, playgrounds and other open spaces; private uses, including
dwelling types; lot layout, locations and heights of structure and landscaped
areas.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition to the date and drawings prescribed in title 11 of this

to be devoted to each land use and a tabulation of the average population
density per net acre and per gross acre in the area or areas proposed to be
devoted to residential use.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The planning and zoning commission may recommend granting a permit for
a planned unit development as the permit is applied for in modified form if, on
the basis of the application and for the evidence submitted, it makes the
following findings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The proposed location of the planned unit development is in accord
with the objectives of the comprehensive general plan, the zoning ordinance and
the purpose of the district in which the site is located;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The proposed location of the planned unit development and the
conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not be
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or materially injurious to
properties or improvements in the vicinity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The proposed planned unit development will comply with each of the
applicable provisions of this title;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site
coverage, yard spaces, heights of structures, distances between structures, off
street parking and off street loading facilities and landscaped areas will
produce an environment of stable and desirable character consistent with the
objectives of the zoning provisions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site
coverage, yard spaces, height of structures, distances between structures and
off street parking and loading facilities will be such that the development
will not generate more traffic than the streets in the vicinity can carry
without congestion and will not overload utilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The combination of different dwelling types and/or the variety of
land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with
the existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. (1971 Code)

CHAPTER 15
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
SECTION:
10-15-1: Development Agreements
10-15-1: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of a development agreement is to provide a vehicle
for development in areas and for uses where, in the opinion of the council or
the commission, approval of a requested rezone by itself does not satisfy the
requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance for rezone approval; but, that
use of a development agreement will assure compliance with the required rezone
findings and conclusions. Development agreements can be used after a
determination has been made that the proposed rezone by itself is not
appropriate, unless the use of a development agreement could allow development
to proceed under stricter restrictions than those imposed generally in the
proposed zoning district. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as
relieving the property which is subject to development agreement restrictions
from further compliance with all other permit and code requirements applicable
because of the zoning designation of the property. Restrictions imposed upon
property as a result of a development agreement are in addition to all other
zoning ordinance requirements.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Request For Development: After an application for rezone has been
received in the planning department, a request to enter into a development
agreement for that parcel may be submitted by the rezone applicant; or, a
development agreement may be required by council at council's rezone hearing,
or may be required by council upon recommendation from the commission following
the commission's rezone hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event of a recommendation by the commission that a
development agreement should be entered into, the rezone shall be forwarded to
the city council with a recommendation that the requested rezone be denied or
that it be remanded to the commission, with the council requiring an
application for a development agreement to be submitted by the applicant. If,
however, the applicant agrees to submit an application for a development
agreement, then the commission shall defer its recommendation to the city
council on the rezone application until a public hearing is held on the
development agreement application. After the public hearing on the development
agreement application is held, the commission shall forward its recommendation
on both the rezone and development agreement requests to the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event of a determination by the council that a development
agreement should be entered into, the council shall remand the matter back to
the commission, with the council requiring an application for a development
agreement to be submitted by the applicant, unless the applicant has already
done so and a public hearing was held under subsection B1 of this section. The
council, shall, upon remand, direct the commission on the specific issue to be
addressed by the development agreement. The commission shall then proceed as
specified in this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In the event a developer seeks to enter into a development
agreement, the developer's application for a development agreement shall be
submitted with the rezone application. The commission shall, following
consideration of the rezone and development agreement applications, forward its
recommendation to the city council regarding each of the applicant's requests.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Stay Of Time Limits: In the event of subsection B1 or B2 of this
section, all time limits required by this code may be stayed upon affirmative
vote of the council or commission.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Form Of Development Agreement Application: All applications for
development agreements shall be in a form as required by the building and
zoning administrator. No application shall be accepted by the administrator

including the time period within which the development or use must commence and
the time period within which the development and the terms of the agreement are
to be completed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A statement that failure to comply with all commitments in the
approved development agreement shall be deemed a consent to rezone the property
to the preexisting zone, or in the case of an initial zone at annexation, a
zone deemed appropriate by the council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â If the development agreement is being requested by the rezone
applicant, as opposed to having been required by council, a statement must be
included that all time limits required by this code are waived.

administrator and the zoning committee of the city council shall work with the
applicant to prepare a development agreement. The development agreement shall
include the requirements of subsection D of this section and any other matter
which, in the discretion of the administrator would address the concerns for
the development which has been proposed by the applicant. Such concerns
addressed may include, but shall not be limited to: density, bulk, site design,
mitigation of impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, appearance, provision of
utilities or public facilities, and restrictions on use. The draft of the
development agreement shall be reviewed by the city attorney as to form prior
to being sent to the planing and zoning commission.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Approval Of Development Agreement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on
the draft development agreement and the rezone request, and make recommendation

Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Recording: Upon approval of a development agreement or any modification
thereto by the council and the applicant, within one year from the date of such
approval it shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant and prior to the
rezone approval. Failure to record the development agreement within the one
year time frame shall automatically render approval of the rezone null and
void. Proof of recording must be submitted by the applicant prior to the third
reading of the rezone ordinance by the Weiser city council. The development
agreement, or any modification thereto, and all conditions, terms, duties or
obligations included therein shall run with the land and shall be considered

development agreement or modification adopted pursuant to this chapter shall
comply with the terms, conditions, obligations and duties contained in the
development agreement or modification.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Modification Of A Development Agreement: Development agreements may
only be modified after public hearing by the city council. Major modifications
as determined by the administrator require a hearing and recommendation from
the planning and zoning commission prior to council's hearing.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Termination Of Development Agreements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Development agreements may be amended or terminated by the city
council, after public hearing, for failure to comply with the commitments
expressed in the development agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Upon termination of the development agreement, the council shall
revert the property to the prior zone or in the case of an initial zone at
annexation, to a zone deemed appropriate by the council. All uses of the
property which are not consistent with the subsequently designated zone

10-19-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. To promote landscaping in the City of Weiser which will
improve community livability, preserve the quality of life, and enhance the
aesthetic quality, economic viability, and environmental health and safety of
the city, and further the purposes set forth in the Idaho Local Land Use
Planning Act, Idaho Code Â§ 67-6502.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Background. The City of Weiser is facing growth issues along the
highway and neighborhood corridors. These problems include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Unscreened outdoor storage areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Unwanted noise.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Failure to enhance the community with corridor landscaping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Water pollution resulting from wind and water erosion of bare soil
surfaces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Air quality concerns resulting from wind borne eroded soil and dust
from bare soil surfaces.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Benefits. The City of Weiser finds that landscaping benefits the City
in the following described ways: There is abundant research available regarding
the benefits of landscaping in communities. This is by no means an exhaustive
summary, but the following are some of the major benefits that our community
would receive through a comprehensive landscape ordinance. Most people think of
landscaping only in terms of aesthetic or beautification benefits, which
certainly exist, but there are also proven economic and environmental benefits
to the community as summarized below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Aesthetic benefits:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Screened parking lots, loading docks, trash receptacles, and
storage areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Reduced glare and reflected light.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Shade for buildings, streets, and parking lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Defines outdoor spaces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Seasonal color, including flowers and fall color.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Frames and reveals desired views.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Adds natural elements to otherwise harsh urban development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Attracts birds and other urban wildlife.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Helps maintain the rural feel of the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Economic benefits:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â More profitable business districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Consumers report greater willingness to pay for products in well
landscaped commercial areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Attracts new businesses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Encourages redevelopment and economic investment in the local
community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Office and retail space lease more quickly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Reduces energy consumption for air conditioning, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Increased residential property values.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Environmental health and safety benefits:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Removes particulate pollutants from the air.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Provides extra oxygen in the atmosphere.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Removes carbon dioxide from theÂ Â Â air.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Improves soil condition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Purifies water supplies, especiallyÂ Â Â storm runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Reduces unwanted noise.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Controls and directs excessive wind.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Sight triangles.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Costs to developers and property owners. The City of Weiser recognizes
that landscaping can be a significant expense to businesses, developers, and
residents. At the same time, landscaping improves the livability of residential
neighborhoods, enhances the appearance and customer attraction of commercial
areas, increases property values, improves the compatibility of adjacent uses,
screens undesirable views, and can reduce air and noise pollution. The intent
of these regulations is to achieve a balance between the right of individuals
to develop and maintain their property in a manner they prefer and the right of
city residents to live, work, shop, and recreate in pleasant, healthy, and
attractive surroundings. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)

head sprays to the next (spacing is 50 percent of the sprinklerâs spray
diameter).
HIGHER INTENSITY USE:
When the purpose or activity for which a piece of land or its buildings is
designed, arranged, or intended results in a greater degree of measurable
noise, odor, light, vibration, or other potential public nuisance than an
adjacent property, it shall be deemed a higher intensity use.

crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.
Good pruning practices rarely remove more than one-fourth to one-third of a
treeâs crown. Topping starves the tree of needed nutrients produced by leaves
in the crown, increases vulnerability to insects and disease, creates weak
limbs, rapid new growth, and disfigures the natural shape of the tree. Other
common terms for topping include stubbing, heading, heading back, stubbing off,
tipping, lopping, or round over. Triangular spacing means placement of
sprinkler heads in an equilateral triangular pattern.

occurring features may be left undeveloped in their natural state and may be
counted as open space with approval of the zoning administrator. (Ord. 1268,
10-10-2023)
10-19-3: LANDSCAPE PLAN:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Applicability. A landscape plan is required for all commercial,
institutional, industrial, office, and multi-family development, redevelopment,
additions, or changes in use. A landscape plan is also required for all common
lots in all subdivisions. The landscape plan is required as parts of all
applications for special use permit (SUP), preliminary plat (PP), or final plat
(FP). The landscape plan may be on the same site plan used to show parking
layout, setback compliance, etc. A preliminary landscape plan review is
recommended prior to submission for all developments but is not required. This
chapter does not apply to a single-family dwelling that is not a part of a
larger development.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Submittal requirements. All landscape plans shall comply with the
requirements for size, scale, number of copies, and contents as detailed in the
application form.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Applicability. All applications for a final plat (FP) must comply
with all requirements of subsection B4, âContentsâ, of this section for a
detailed landscape plan. Applications for special use permit (SUP) and
preliminary plat (PP) are exempt from requirements of subsections B.4.m, B.4.n,
B.4.0, and B.4.p of this section and may instead show conceptual landscaping
with tree locations only and conceptual screening structures; all other
sections of this chapter still apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Plan size and scale. The landscape plan must have a scale no smaller
than one-inch equals 20 feet and be on a standard drawing sheet, not to exceed
36 inches by 48 inches (36" x 48") (24 inches by 36 inches is preferred). A
plan which cannot be drawn in its entirety on a single sheet must be drawn with
appropriate match lines on two or more sheets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Number of copies. The administrator shall determine the number of
copies of the landscape plan that shall be submitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Contents. The landscape plan shall comply with the provisions of
this chapter and shall include the following elements:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â PP and FP applications:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Width of street buffer, linearâ feet of street frontage,
and number of street frees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Residential subdivision trees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Acreage dedicated to common open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Number of trees provided on common lot(s).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Mitigation for removal of existing trees.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Landscape plan preparation. Preparing a landscape plan requires special
skills. Landscaping involves more than a simple arrangement of plants with
irrigation; plants are not haphazardly placed in a way that fills up leftover
space. Landscape plans should be artfully and technically organized in a way
that conveys coherence, design, and organization. The landscaping should
enhance the physical environment as well as the projectâs aesthetic character.
Also, plans prepared by a landscape professional minimize the likelihood of
trees dying or interfering with other adjacent site features.
Â Â Â Therefore, all landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect,
landscape designer, qualified nurseryman, or someone knowledgeable in the field
of landscape design.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Landscape plan modification. The approved landscape plan shall not be
altered without prior approval of the planning and zoning administrator. No
significant field changes to the plan are permitted. Prior written approval of
all material changes is required. All approved changes to the landscape plan
must be documented prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. (Ord. 1268,
10-10-2023)
10-19-4: MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS AND INSTALLATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Approved plant material. The publication titled âTree Selection Guide
for Streets and Landscapes Throughout Idahoâ by the Urban Forestry Unit of the
Boise Parks and Recreation Department (latest edition) is hereby adopted by
this reference as the City of Weiser list of approved and prohibited plant
material. The publication categorizes the frees by size as class I, class II,
or class III trees. The city recognizes that new plant varieties are being
produced every year and will consider other species not listed in the
publication. Copies of the publication will be available from the planning and
zoning department.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prohibited plant material. The plants listed under âtrees not permitted
for rights-of-way property plantingâ are prohibited from being planted along
any street or within any parking lot regulated by this chapter. The only
exception is that conifers may be planted in street buffers around residential
subdivisions, and in buffers along Highway 95.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum plant sizes. The following are minimum plant sizes for all
required landscape areas:
Â 
Evergreen trees  4- to 5-foot height minimum
Ornamental frees 1 Z-inch caliper minimum
Shade frees      1 Zâ-inch caliper minimum
Woody shrubs     2-gallon pot minimum
Â 
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Tree species mix. When five or more trees are to be planted to meet the
requirements of any portion of this chapter, including street trees, street
buffers, parking lot landscaping and other landscape guidelines, a mix of
species shall be provided. The number of species to be planted shall vary
according to the overall number of trees required to be planted. See the table
below:
Â 
Required Number of Trees Minimum Number of Species
5-10                     2
11-30                    3
31-50                    4
50+                      5
Â 
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Plant quality. All plant material installed pursuant to this chapter
shall meet or exceed the minimum federal standards as regulated by ANSI Z60.1,
American standard for nursery stock.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Planting standards. All trees, shrubs, and other plant material shall
be planted using accepted nursery standards as published by the American
Association of Nurserymen (latest edition) including hole size, backfilling,
and fertilization.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Staking. Tree staking may be used in areas with high winds or other
situations that make staking desirable. When trees are staked, the stakes must
be removed within 12 months to prevent damage to the tree.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Mulch. Unless other materials are approved by the administrator or
Design Review committee, organic mulch such as compost, bark or soil aid shall
be applied to all planting areas for moisture retention, weed control, and
moderation of soil temperatures. Impermeable plastic weed barriers are
prohibited under the mulch because it restricts water and oxygen to the roots.
Unless other materials are approved by the Planning & Zoning administrator or
Design Review committee, gravel/rock mulch is prohibited in required landscape
areas as per subsection M.2 of this section.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Curbing. All planting areas that border driveways, parking lots, and
other vehicle use areas shall be protected by street curbing, wheel stops, or
other approved protective devices. Such devices shall be a minimum of 30 inches
from all tree trunks to prevent cars from damaging tree trunks.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Utilities. The following standards apply to the planting of trees near
existing utilities and to trenching for new utilities near existing trees:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Overhead utilities. Only class I trees in the recommended plant list
may be planted under or within ten lateral feet of any overhead utility wires.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Underground utilities. All trees shall be planted outside of any
easement that contains a power, water, or sewer main, unless written approval
is obtained from the city engineer. If any utility easement precludes trees
required by this chapter, the width of the required buffer shall be increased
to accommodate the required trees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Trenching. New underground utilities shall stay outside of the drip
line of existing trees if trenched or be tunneled a minimum of three feet below
existing grade within the treeâs drip line. The guiding principle is that no
root two inches or larger shall be cut. Note: This requirement is for placement
of new utilities and does not affect the property ownerâs ability to access
existing utilities for repair and maintenance.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Erosion control. Soil and slope stabilization shall result from the
landscape installation.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Berms. Berm slopes shall not exceed three to one (3:1) (horizontal:
vertical). Three to one (3:1) maximum slopes are recommended. Grass that
requires mowing shall not be used on slopes steeper than three to one (3:1).
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Water efficiency. The landscape plan shall provide for water efficient
landscaping as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lawn areas. Where appropriate, and on sites where other landscape
options can be incorporated, large expanses of lawn are discouraged due to its
high-water consumption.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Mulch. Unless other materials are approved by the administrator or
Design Review committee, mulches shall be organic and broad uses of gravel/rock
mulch are restricted as per subsection H of this section. Gravel does not
retain water, reflects heat, and causes greater stress on trees and shrubs.
Organic mulch retains water for a longer period for plants.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Irrigation. Irrigation systems shall be designed for water
efficiency as regulated by section 9-17-5 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Native plants. Native and other low water use plants are encouraged.
The approved plant list as per subsection A of this section shows the general
water requirements of the trees. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-5: IRRIGATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Irrigation required. All landscape areas regulated by this chapter
shall be served with an automatic underground irrigation system. If any
irrigation improvements are approved to be located within a public right-of-
way, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to obtain all necessary
permits and/or approvals from the respective road authority prior to
installation.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Performance specifications. Three copies of detailed irrigation
performance specifications shall be submitted with the landscape plan for all
final plats and certificates of zoning compliance. Performance specifications
shall state design requirements, materials, and construction methods. At a
minimum, the performance specifications shall address the following
requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Required information. Specifications for the irrigation system shall
include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Available gallons per minute.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Available water pressure; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Point of connection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Backflow prevention. Provide an appropriate backflow prevention
device that is registered with the public works department.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Coverage. The irrigation system shall be designed to provide 100
percent coverage with head-to-head spacing or triangular spacing as
appropriate. For design flexibility, maximum spacing is up to 60 percent of the
sprinklerâs spray diameter. Where winds are a threat, spacing up to 40 percent
may be desirable. For triangular spacing, the distance between heads in each
row must be âhead-to-head spacingâ as per the definition in this section. The
distance between rows is 0.866 times the spacing within the row.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Matched precipitation rates. Sprinkler heads shall have matched
precipitation rates within each control valve circuit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Irrigation zones. Sprinkler heads irrigating lawn or other high
water demand areas shall be circuited so that they are on a separate zone or
zones from those irrigating trees, shrubs, or other reduced water demand areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Overspray. Sprinkler heads shall be adjusted to reduce overspray
onto impervious surfaces such as sidewalks, driveways, and parking areas.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Subdivision irrigation systems. If the irrigation system is part of a
residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision, any irrigation pump station
shall be on a common lot. Also, the irrigation system must be owned and
maintained by an irrigation district or a homeownersâ (or business ownersâ)
association. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-6: SIGHT TRIANGLES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Standards. The following standards shall be observed within all sight
triangles, both at controlled and uncontrolled intersections. In all cases,
Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and Washington County Road Department
standards shall apply in addition to City of Weiser standards.
Â Â Â B. Â Â Â Road/road intersections. The bou nda ries of a sight triangle at the
intersection of two roads are defined by measuring from the projected
intersection of the roadway edge a distance of 40 feet along each roadway edge
and connecting the two points with a straight line. (See diagram below.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/f906dec7bf3eaf5a3d8097e51e5458e580e68d33/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1423.png]
Â 
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Road/driveway intersections. The boundaries of a sight triangle at the
intersection of a road and a driveway are defined by measuring from the
intersection of the property line and the edge of the driveway 20 feet along
the roadway and ten feet along the driveway and connecting the two points with
a straight line. (See diagram below.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/f906dec7bf3eaf5a3d8097e51e5458e580e68d33/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1425.png]
Â 
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Road/railroad intersections. The sight triangle at road/road
intersections (see subsection B of this section) is also applicable to railroad
street crossings with the vision triangle defined by measuring 40 feet along
the railroad property line and 40 feet along the roadway edge and connecting
the two points with a straight line.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Planting and development standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any trees planted within sight triangles (class I or II) shall be
pruned to a minimum height of eight feet above the ground or sidewalk surface
and 14 feet above the adjacent roadway surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No evergreen trees shall be planted within any sight triangle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â No class III trees shall be planted within any sight triangle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The maximum height of any berm or vegetative ground cover at
maturity within the sight triangle is three feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â No fences higher than three feet are permitted in the sight
triangle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â No signs taller than three feet are permitted in the sight triangle,
except for street/stop signs approved by the City of Weiser Public Works
Department.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Public safety and enforcement. When the city determines that a sight
obstruction exists, it shall notify the owner of the property upon which the
obstruction is located and order that the obstruction be removed within 30
days. The failure of the owner to remove the obstruction shall be punishable as
a misdemeanor, and every day the owner fails to remove the obstruction shall be
a separate and distinct offense. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-7: STREET BUFFERS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. Landscape buffers along streets are required to improve the
visual quality of the streetscape, to soften the impact of parking lots, to
unify diverse architecture, and to carry out the comprehensive plan policies
related to promoting attractive roadways and street beautification.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Location. All required buffers shall be located beyond any street
right-of-way and shall be maintained by the property owner, at the property
ownerâs expense, upon which the buffer lies. All street buffers with attached
sidewalks shall be measured from the property line and not from the sidewalk or
curb. If detached sidewalks are provided as per subsection H of this section,
the buffer may be measured from the back of curb when it can be demonstrated
that there is no opportunity for expansion of the street section within the
right-of-way; the buffer width must exclude the width of the sidewalk. No
fences are permitted within required street buffers.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Applicability. Street buffers shall be required at all subdivision
boundaries (i.e., commercial, industrial, high tech, and residential) and all
commercial, industrial, and high-tech developments. Single-family residential,
and duplex lots are exempt from required street buffers. All subdivision street
buffers must be on a common lot, maintained by a homeownersâ or business
ownersâ association, as applicable.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Buffer size. The required width of the landscape buffer is calculated
as follows. Note: Residential collectors do not have a required street buffer.
Â 
Street Type                                                       Buffer Width
Local roads (except in residential areas per subsection C of this 10 feet1
section)
Collector and arterial roads                                      15 feet1
Â Â Â Note:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the street buffer is separated by a sidewalk, no less than five
feet of the buffer must be located on the property side of the sidewalk.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Width reduction. In a development where the required street buffer
width results in an otherwise unavoidable hardship to the property owner, a
written request for a reduction may be submitted to the zoning administrator.
The request must demonstrate evidence of the hardship caused by the required
street buffer and propose a specific alternative width. In no case shall the
width be reduced to less than ten percent of the depth of the lot without a
variance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Street trees. All required landscape street buffers shall be planted
with trees and shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover, with a minimum
density of one tree per 35 linear feet. If this calculation results in a
fraction 0.5 or greater, round up to an additional tree. If the calculation
results in a fraction less than 0.5, round the number down.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Tree spacing. For design flexibility, trees may be grouped together or
spaced evenly as desired. However, trees shall be spaced no closer than 80
percent of the average mature width of the trees, as demonstrated in the
following examples:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/f906dec7bf3eaf5a3d8097e51e5458e580e68d33/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1427.png]
Â 
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Parkways and detached sidewalks. Upon written approval of the
respective road authority, a portion of a required street buffer may be located
within a public right-of-way parkway. The minimum buffer widths in subsection D
of this section must still be met provided that no less than five feet of the
required buffer is located on the property side of the sidewalk. The minimum
width of the parkway area between the curb and the sidewalk is five feet. Tree
plantings within parkways less than ten feet wide are restricted to class II
trees.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Landscaping within right-of-way. If the unimproved street right-of-way
is greater than 13 feet from edge of pavement to edge of sidewalk or property
line, developer shall maintain a ten- foot-wide gravel shoulder and landscape
the remainder with lawn or other vegetative ground cover. This will require an
agreement between the property owner and the City of Weiser Street Department.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Impervious surfaces. Allowed impervious surfaces include driveways,
signs and walkways. Vehicle display pads and other related impervious surfaces
are prohibited in the required street buffer.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Berms in street buffers. Berm design is subject to the provisions of
sections
10-19-4 and
10-19-6 E.4 of this chapter.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Storm-water detention. Stormwater swales may be incorporated into the
buffer as provided for in section
10-19-11 of this chapter. Other stormwater detention and retention facilities
shall not be permitted in the street buffer. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-8: PARKING LOTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Right-of-way landscaping. A landscape buffer is required between all
parking lots and adjacent streets as regulated by section
10-19-7, street buffers, of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Perimeter landscaping. The following standards apply to all interior
lot lines, side, or rear, adjacent to parking lots or other vehicular use
areas, including driveways:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose. Perimeter landscaping defines parking, loading, and other
vehicular use areas and prevents two adjacent lots from becoming one large
expanse of paving. This requirement does not hinder the ability to provide
vehicular access between lots, nor does it prohibit commercial or industrial
developments with back-to-back truck docks from sharing paved loading areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Size and location. Provide a five-foot minimum perimeter landscape
strip along all front lot lines and side lot lines to the rear of any building
on the lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Landscaping. The perimeter landscape strip shall be planted with one
tree per 35 linear feet and shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Internal landscaping. Interior parking lot landscaping shall be
required on any parking lot with more than 12 spaces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Required percentage. The required amount of landscaping is based on
a sliding scale as follows:
Â 
Total Number of Parking Spaces Percent of Total Area of a Parking Lot that Must
                               be an Interior Landscaped Area
13-100                         4 percent
101-200                        6 percent
201 +                          8 percent
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Planter size. Landscape planters shall contain a minimum of 50
square feet and the planting area shall not be less than five feet in any
dimension, measured inside curbs. The only exception to the five-foot minimum
dimension is at the tip of triangular planters located at the end of rows of
angled parking.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Parking spaces. No linear grouping of parking spaces shall exceed 15
in a row, without an internal planter island.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Parking lot layout. Interior landscaping shall, insofar as possible,
be used to delineate and guide major traffic movement within the parking area
to prevent cross space driving. Interior landscape planters shall be spaced as
evenly as feasible and at the ends of rows of parking throughout the lot to
consistently reduce the visual impact of long rows of parked cars.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Trees required. Each interior planter that serves a single row of
parking spaces shall be landscaped with at least one tree and shall be covered
with low shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover. Each interior planter
that serves a double row of parking spaces shall have at least two trees and
shall be covered with low shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover.
Deciduous shade trees must be pruned to a minimum height of eight feet above
the adjacent parking areas. Evergreen trees and class III trees are prohibited
in interior planters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Design flexibility. In parking areas where the strict application of
subsection C.1. of this section will seriously limit the function and
circulation of the lot, up to 50 percent of the required landscaping may be
located near the perimeter of the paved area to emphasize entrance corridors or
special landscape areas within the general parking area. Such required interior
landscaping which is relocated shall be in addition to perimeter landscape and
right-of-way screening requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Industrial exclusion. Industrial parking, storage, and loading areas
are specifically excluded from the interior landscape requirements but shall
still be required to meet all perimeter and right-of-way landscape and
screening requirements.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Existing parking lot applicability. Existing parking lots shall be
required to conform to this section based upon the following guidelines:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â For restriping, parking lot overlays, or parking lot replacement
less than 25 percent, no additional landscaping shall be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For parking lot replacement that is 25 percent to 50 percent of the
parking area, perimeter and right-of-way landscaping as required by this
chapter shall be installed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â For parking lot replacement that is greater than 50 percent of the
parking area, all current landscape standards of this chapter shall be met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â If the location of existing building or other structures prevents
conformance with the requirements of this section, or if its implementation
would create a nonconformity with parking standards, the zoning administrator
shall determine how the code is to be applied. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-9: BUFFERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAND USES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. The landscape requirements in this section are intended to
ensure incompatible, adjoining land uses are adequately protected and are
provided with an appropriate amount of land separation to conduct permitted
uses without causing adverse impact. An âincompatible land useâ is defined as
one that is more intensely developed than its neighbor (as defined herein under
subsection D of this section) and typically involves minimizing potential
nuisances such as noise, dirt, litter, glare of lights, or other objectionable
activities. The buffers are required along the entire contiguous property line.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsibility for buffer construction. The required buffer between
different land uses shall be provided by the higher intensity use and shall be
located on the building site of the higher intensity use, except as determined
otherwise by the zoning administrator after written request. If a lower
intensity use is proposed adjacent to an existing higher intensity use with no
buffer, the lower intensity use must provide the required buffer.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Puffer material. The materials within the required buffer between
incompatible land uses are regulated as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Mix of materials. All buffer areas shall be comprised of, but not
limited to, a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, lawn, or other
vegetative ground cover. Fences, walls and berms may also be incorporated into
the buffer area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Barrier effectiveness. The required buffer area shall result in an
effective barrier within three years and be maintained such that 60 percent or
more of the vertical surface is closed and prevents the passage of vision
through it. Trees may be spaced closer as necessary to achieve this goal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Buffer walls. Where existing or proposed adjacent land uses cannot
be adequately buffered with plant material(s), the city may require inclusion
of a wall, fence, or other type of screen that mitigates noise and/or unsightly
uses. If a wall or fence at least six feet tall is provided, the planting
requirement may be reduced to at least one tree per 35 linear feet, plus
shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover must be provided within the
buffer area, in lieu of the requirements of subsection C.2. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Chain-link fencing. Chain-link or cyclone fencing, with or without
slats, is prohibited within required buffers between different land uses.
Chain-link may be used beyond the required buffer. Chain-link fencing does not
qualify as a screening material; therefore, the buffer must still be landscaped
as per subsection C.2. of this section, even if a chain-link fence is provided.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Land use intensity classifications. The table below is intended to
provide a general classification of land use intensities for commonly proposed
developments and is not a comprehensive list. If a land use is not listed, the
intensity classification shall be determined by the zoning administrator based
upon the nearest use listed.
Â Â Â Class I
Â Â Â Â Â Â Cemeteries
Â Â Â Â Â Â Duplexes
Â Â Â Â Â Â Golf courses
Â Â Â Â Â Â Parks
Â Â Â Â Â Â Single-family homes
Â Â Â Â Â Â Vacant land zoned: R-l and R-2
Â Â Â Class II
Â Â Â Â Â Â Childcare facilities
Â Â Â Â Â Â Elementary schools
Â Â Â Â Â Â Libraries
Â Â Â Â Â Â Multi-family dwellings
Â Â Â Â Â Â Senior centers
Â Â Â Â Â Â Vacant land zoned: R-3 and R-4
Â Â Â Class III
Â Â Â Â Â Â Clinics
Â Â Â Â Â Â High schools
Â Â Â Â Â Â Middle schools

Â Â Â Â Â Â Processing plants
Â Â Â Â Â Â Recycling
Â Â Â Â Â Â Vacant land zoned: I
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Minimum buffer widths. The minimum buffer width between incompatible
land uses is based on the following table:
Â 
Intensity Class Intensity Class of Adjacent Use
of Proposed Use I  II III IV V
I
II              20
III             20 20
IV              25 20 20
V               35 30 25  20
Â Â Â Notes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Buffer widths are shown in feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No buffer is required for blank cells, unless an existing, adjacent,
and higher intensity use has not provided a buffer. In such cases, the lower
intensity use must provide the buffer as per subsection B of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The buffers between land uses are required only along contiguous lot
lines. If incompatible land uses are across a public street from one another,
the street buffer requirements of section
10-19-7 of this chapter apply. Additionally, the buffers between land uses do
not apply to incompatible land uses separated by a public alley unless
otherwise required through a special use permit or other development permit
application.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Pedestrian access. Landscaping and screens shall not eliminate
pedestrian access from residential development to abutting commercial districts
and vice versa.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Existing partial buffers. If all or any part of the buffer has been
provided on the adjacent property, the proposed use must provide only that
amount of the buffer which has not been provided on the adjacent property.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Relationship to parking lot perimeter requirements. All buffers between
different land uses may include any required perimeter parking lot landscape
strips (see section
10-19-8. B of this chapter) when calculating the minimum width of the buffer.
(Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-10: PRESERVATION OF EXISTING TREES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. This section is intended to preserve existing trees four-inch
caliper or greater from destruction during the development process.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Site design. Site plans shall make all feasible attempts to accommodate
existing trees four-inch caliper or greater within their design.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Landscape plan. All existing trees greater than a four-inch caliper
shall be shown on the landscape plan as per section
10-19-3. B.4.h. of this chapter. Indicate whether each tree is to be retained
or removed. Include on the plan a description of how existing trees to be
retained are to be protected during construction as per section
10-19-3. B.4.i. of this chapter.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protection during construction. Existing trees that are retained shall
be protected from damage to bark, branches, and roots during construction.
Construction, excavation, or fill occurring within the drip line of any
existing tree may severely damage it. Any severely damaged tree shall be
replaced in accordance with subsection F of this section.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Construction within the drip line of existing trees. Specific
requirements for construction within the drip line of existing trees are as
follows;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Paving. Whenever possible, impervious paving surfaces shall remain
outside of the drip line of existing trees. When it is not possible, impervious
surfaces shall be allowed at a distance from the truck of a retained tree equal
to the diameter of the tree trunk plus five feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Grade changes. Grade changes greater than six inches are prohibited
within the drip line of existing trees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Compaction. Most of the damage to trees caused by machinery occurs
to the root system from compaction of the soil. A simple fence or barrier that
encloses the entire area beneath the tree canopy shall be in place prior to
construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Utilities. New underground utilities to be placed within the drip
line of existing trees shall be installed as per section
10-19-4. J.3. of this chapter.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Mitigation trees. Mitigation is required for all existing frees four-
inch caliper or greater that are removed from the site with equal replacement
of the total calipers lost on site. Example: Two, ten-inch caliper trees
removed may be mitigated with four, five-inch caliper trees, five, four-inch
caliper trees, or seven, three-inch caliper frees. Existing prohibited trees
within the street buffer or parking lot need not be mitigated if they are
removed. Existing dead, dying, or hazard frees need not be mitigated if they
are removed. Trees that are required to be removed by another governmental
agency having jurisdiction over the project need not be mitigated for.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Required landscaping. Existing trees that are retained or relocated on
site may count toward the required landscaping. Mitigation trees are in
addition to all other landscaping required by this chapter.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Incentives. The zoning administrator may allow a reduction of up to ten
percent of the required parking spaces to accommodate existing trees. Approval
of the reduction in required parking must be obtained in wilting prior to
submittal of plans. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-11: STORMWATER INTEGRATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. The city encourages the incorporation of vegetated, well
designed stormwater filtration swales into required landscape areas where
topography and hydrologic features allow. Such integrated site designs can
improve water quality and provide a natural, effective form of flood and water
pollution control.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Design guidelines. Below are requirements for designing a landscape
area that integrates stormwater facilities. The planning and zoning commission
and the City of Weiser Public Works Department should be involved in the
initial design and determining the appropriateness of any site.

10-19-15: ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. The intent of this section is to encourage creative solutions
to land use problems. The city recognizes that the specific requirements of
this chapter cannot and do not anticipate all possible landscape situations. In
addition, the City of Weiser recognizes that there may be landscape proposals
which conform to the purpose, intent, and objectives of the landscape
regulations but were not anticipated in the specific regulations. Therefore,
the administrator of planning and zoning may allow for a method of alternative
compliance in the event of these situations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conditions. Requests for alternative compliance are allowed only when
one or more of the following conditions are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such that
full compliance is impossible or impractical.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The site involves space limitations or an unusually shaped lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Due to a change of use on an existing site, the required landscape
buffer is larger than can be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Additional environmental quality improvements would result from the
alternative compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Safety considerations make alternative compliance desirable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Other regulatory agencies or departments having jurisdiction are
requiring design standards that conflict with the requirements of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The applicant is proposing a pond with a permanent water level in a
required landscape area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Submittal requirements. The following items are required to apply for
alternative compliance. Note: If a project is being submitted as a Planned Unit
Development, a separate application for alternative compliance is not required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A written request for alternative compliance shall be submitted to
the planning and zoning commission prior to submittal of the development
application. The request shall state:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The ordinance requirements that are proposed to be modified.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The project conditions in subsection B of this section which
justify the proposed alternative; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â How the proposed alternative meets or exceeds the intent of said
requirement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A conceptual site plan and other information as necessary to
illustrateÂ Â Â  the proposed method of alternative compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â An application fee as set by the Weiser City Council.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Authority to vary on a case-by-case basis the required landscaping
where an alternative requirement would address unique site conditions and allow
design flexibility while still serving the intent of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Variance. If compliance with this chapter is not possible and there is
no feasible proposal for alternative compliance which is, in the judgment of
the planning administrator, equal or better than normal compliance, the
applicant must apply for a variance in accordance with the provision of
chapter 14 of Title 10. The applicant may also appeal the decision to the
Weiser City Council by filing an appeal with the city clerkâs office.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Precedent. Alternative compliance shall not be limited to the specific
project under consideration and shall not establish precedent for acceptance in
other cases.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Timeline. The zoning administrator or the administratorâs designee
shall respond to the applicant within 15 working days regarding acceptance or
denial of the proposed alternative. (Ord. 1268, 10-10-2023)
10-19-16: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Issuance of certificate of occupancy. All required landscaping and site
improvements must be installed according to the approved landscape plan prior
to issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Private site improvements that
are above and beyond the requirements placed on the application do not require
completion prior to occupancy; for example, a clubhouse in a residential
subdivision need not be completed prior to occupancy of residences in the
subdivision.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Extension of time for compliance. The zoning administrator or building
official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a specified time
period, not to exceed 180 days when, due to weather or other circumstances, the
landscaping or other required site amenities cannot be completed. Whenever a
temporary certificate of occupancy is issued, the following shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Letter of credit, certified check, or cash deposit. An irrevocable
bank letter of credit, certified check, or cash deposit for 150 percent of the
cost of materials and installation must be filed with the city clerk prior to
issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. A formal bid must accompany
the irrevocable bank letter of credit, certified check, or cash deposit. The
irrevocable bank letter of credit shall be effective for the minimum period
determined by the council. The irrevocable bank letter of credit, certified
check or cash deposit will not be released until all landscaping and other site
amenities are completed as shown on the approved site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Permission to enter property. Any property owner wishing to make
arrangements with the city for a temporary certificate of occupancy must also
allow the city to enter upon the land for the purposes of installing the
required landscaping and other site improvements in the event the landscaping
is not in place when the temporary certificate of occupancy expires. (Ord.
