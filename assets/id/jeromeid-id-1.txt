There is created in the city, a special fund known and designated as the "local
improvement guarantee fund" of the city. (Prior code §12-1)
3.08.020: PURPOSE:
The local improvement guarantee fund is created for the purpose of
guaranteeing, to the extent of such fund the payment of local improvement

any local improvement district in the city for the payment of local
improvements therein. (Prior code §12-2)

In order to provide money for the local improvement guarantee fund and for the
use and the purposes of such fund, the mayor and city council shall levy an
annual tax of one mill per year, beginning with the tax due and collectible in
the year 1958, on all of the taxable property in the city; provided, however,
that the city may reduce the amount of levy if the city appropriates from other
proper sources, as may be determined by the city, a sum approximately equal in
amount to the sum which it is estimated will not be collected but would have
been collected except for such reduction of the levy; and provided, further,
that the total sum so levied or appropriated, or both, in any year, shall not
be more than sufficient to pay the outstanding warrants on such fund and to
establish therein a balance, which combined levy and appropriations in any one
year shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the outstanding obligations thereby
guaranteed; and provided, further, that the city shall not levy and tax as
provided in this chapter when the amount of monies in the local improvement
guarantee fund equals ten percent (10%) of the total outstanding obligations to
be guaranteed. The tax levies authorized and directed in this chapter shall be
additional to, and if need be, in excess of any and all statutory and charter
limitations. (Prior code §12-3)
3.08.040: WHEN WARRANTS TO BE PAID OUT OF FUND; INTEREST ON UNPAID WARRANTS:
When any bond, warrant or coupon drawn against any local improvement fund is
presented to the city for payment and there is not sufficient amount in the
local improvement fund against which to draw to pay the same, unless otherwise
requested by the holder, payment therefor shall be made by warrant drawn
against the local improvement guarantee fund. Such warrants when presented to
the city treasurer for payment, if not paid, shall be registered and shall draw
interest at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum. Neither the holder nor the
owner of any bond or warrant issued in any local improvement district shall
have any claim therefor except for the payment from the special assessments
made for the improvement for which such bond or warrant was issued and except
against the local improvement guarantee fund provided for in this chapter. The
city shall not be liable to any holder or owner of such bond or warrant for any
loss to any guarantee fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the
city. (Prior code §12-4)

rights of the holders or owners of the bonds or interest, coupons or warrants
so paid, and the policies thereof, or the assessment underlying the same, shall
become part of the guarantee fund.

local improvement fund after the payment of all outstanding bonds or warrants

Idaho Code, and the terms of this chapter, and all other laws amendatory
thereof and supplemental thereto, shall be paid into the local improvement
guarantee fund, and all delinquency certificates issued and any such property
acquired shall be held by the city for the benefit of such guarantee fund.
B.   Money from the guarantee fund may be used to redeem property subject to
local improvement assessments from general tax delinquencies underlying bonds
or warrants guaranteed by the fund, or to purchase such property at county tax
sales or otherwise, from the county for the purpose of protecting the guarantee
fund.
C.   After so acquiring title to real property, the city may lease or sell and
convey the same for such price and on such terms as may be determined by the
mayor and city council, and any provisions of law, charter or ordinance to the
contrary notwithstanding, and all proceeds resulting therefrom shall belong to
and be paid into the guarantee fund; provided, however, that in the event the
city purchases such property at tax sale, or otherwise, it shall not be sold
for a lesser sum than the city paid therefor. (Prior code §12-6)
3.08.070: TAX LEVY TO REPLENISH FUND:
Whenever there is not a sufficient amount of cash in the local improvement
guarantee fund at any time to pay any and all warrants, together with interest
thereon, drawn against such fund, the city council may replenish the local
improvement guarantee fund by transferring or appropriating to it, monies from
the general fund of the city, or other available sources as may be determined
by the city council subject, however, to the limitations prescribed in this
chapter. Warrants drawing interest as provided in this chapter may be issued
against the local improvement guarantee fund to meet any financial inability
against it; but, at the time of making its next annual tax levy the city shall
provide for the levy of a sum sufficient with other resources of the guarantee
fund, to pay warrants so issued and outstanding, the tax for this purpose not
to exceed one mill in any one year. (Prior code §12-7)
3.08.080: LIMITATION OF CLAIM OF PERSONS HOLDING LOCAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS OR
WARRANTS:

claim thereon against the city, except to the extent of the funds created and

district and to the extent of his pro rata share of the local improvement
guarantee fund, authorized and issued under the provisions of this chapter.
(Prior code §12-8)

such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works;
      d.   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined in this section;
   15.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
B.   If any waters or wastewaters are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the judgment of
the city administrator, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater
treatment facility, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city
administrator may:
   1.   Reject the wastes;
   2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
   3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
   4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating wastes
not covered by sewer charges under the provisions of section
13.20.010 of this title.
C.   If the city administrator permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
by established industry methods, and shall be subject to approval of the city
administrator or his appointed agent. Effluent from pretreatment facilities
shall be subject to the requirements of title 40, part 403, "General
Pretreatment Regulations For Existing And New Sources Of Pollution", the code
of federal regulations. The requirements of title 40, part 403 shall supersede

category of users and which appear in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405–471.
   CATEGORICAL USER: A user regulated by one of EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards.
   CITY: The city of Jerome or the city council of Jerome or the city
administrator for Jerome or any authorized representatives of these entities/
individuals.
   CITY ADMINISTRATOR: The person designated by the city to supervise the
operation of the POTW, and who is charged with certain duties and
responsibilities by this chapter, or a duly authorized representative.
   COLOR: The optical density at the visual wavelength of maximum absorption,
relative to distilled water. One hundred percent (100%) transmittance is
equivalent to zero (0.0) optical density.

wastewater samples taken at selected intervals based on an increment of either
flow or time.
   COOLING WATER/NONCONTACT COOLING WATER: Water used for cooling which does
not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste
product, or finished product. Cooling water may be generated from any use, such
as air conditioning, heat exchangers, cooling or refrigeration to which the
only pollutant added is heat.
   DOMESTIC USER (RESIDENTIAL USER): Any person who contributes, causes, or
allows the contribution of wastewater into the POTW that is of a similar volume
and/or chemical makeup as that of a residential dwelling unit. Discharges from
a residential dwelling unit typically include up to one hundred (100) gallons
per capita per day, 0.2 pounds of BOD per capita, and 0.17 pounds of TSS per
capita.
   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA): The U.S. environmental protection
agency or, where appropriate, the director of the region 10 office of water, or
other duly authorized official of said agency.
   EXISTING SOURCE: For a categorical industrial user, an "existing source" is
any source of discharge, the construction or operation of which commenced prior
to the publication by EPA of proposed categorical pretreatment standards, which
will be applicable to such source if the standard is thereafter promulgated in
accordance with section 307 of the act.
   EXISTING USER: For noncategorical users, an "existing user" is defined as
any user which is discharging wastewater prior to the effective date of this
chapter.
   GRAB SAMPLE: A sample consisting of either a single discrete sample or
individual samples collected over a period of time not to exceed fifteen (15)
minutes. The grab sample should be representative of the wastewater conditions
at the time of sample collection. The sample volume depends on the type and
number of analyses to be performed.
   INDIRECT DISCHARGE OR DISCHARGE: The introduction of pollutants into the
POTW from any nondomestic source regulated under section 307(b), (c), or (d) of
the act. The discharge into the POTW is normally by means of pipes, conduits,
pumping stations, force mains, constructed drainage ditches, surface water
intercepting ditches, and all constructed devices and appliances appurtenant
thereto.
   INTERFERENCE: A discharge which alone or in conjunction with a discharge or
discharges from other sources, either: a) inhibits or disrupts the POTW, its
treatment processes or operations; b) inhibits or disrupts its sludge
processes, use or disposal; or c) is a cause of a violation of the city's NPDES
permit or of the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal in compliance with
any of the following statutory/regulatory provisions or permits issued
thereunder (or more stringent state or local regulations): section 405 of the
clean water act; the solid waste disposal act (SWDA), including title II
commonly referred to as the resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA); any
state regulations contained in any state sludge management plan prepared
pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA; the clean air act; the toxic substances
control act.

a pollutant allowed to be discharged at any time, determined from the analysis
of any discrete or composited sample collected, independent of the industrial
flow rate and the duration of the sampling event.
   MEDICAL WASTES: Isolation wastes, infectious agents, human blood and blood
products, pathological wastes, sharps, body parts, contaminated bedding,
surgical wastes, potentially contaminated laboratory wastes, and dialysis
wastes.
   NEW SOURCE:
   A.   Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is
(or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced
after the publication of proposed categorical pretreatment standards under
section 307(c) of the act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided
that:
      1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at
a site at which no other source is located; or
      2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection A2 or A3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
   C.   Construction of a new source as herein defined has commenced if the
owner or operator has:
      1.   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site
construction program:a. Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities
or equipment; orb. Significant site preparation work including clearing,
excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which
is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source
facilities or equipment; or
      2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which is intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering,
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
subsection.
   NEW USER: A new user is a user that is not regulated under federal
categorical pretreatment standards but that applies to the city for a new
building permit or occupies an existing building and plans to commence
discharge of wastewater to the city's collection system after the effective
date of this chapter. Any person that buys an existing facility that is
discharging nondomestic wastewater will be considered an existing user if no
significant changes are made in the manufacturing operation.
   PASS-THROUGH: A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United
States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a
discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any
requirement of the city's IPDES permit (including an increase in the magnitude
or duration of a violation).
   PERMITTEE: A person or user issued a wastewater discharge permit.
   PERSON: Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company,

turbidity, color, BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), toxicity, or odor.
   PRETREATMENT: The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to (or in lieu of) introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical, or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means (except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard).
   PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENT: Any substantive or procedural requirement related
to pretreatment imposed on a user, other than a pretreatment standard.
   PRETREATMENT STANDARDS OR STANDARDS: Prohibited discharge standards,
categorical pretreatment standards, and local limits established by the city.
   PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS OR PROHIBITED DISCHARGES: Absolute
prohibitions against the discharge of certain substances; these prohibitions
appear in subsections
13.18.100A and B of this chapter.
   PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW): A "treatment works", as defined by
section 212 of the act (33 USC 1292) which is owned by the city. This
definition includes any devices or systems used in the collection, storage,
treatment, recycling, and reclamation of sewage or industrial wastes of a
liquid nature and any conveyances which convey wastewater to a treatment plant.
The term also means the city.

boiler blowdown wastewater); or
      2.   Contributes a process wastestream which makes up five percent (5%)
or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW
treatment plant; or
      3.   Is designated as such by the city on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
   C.   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsection B of this
definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's
operation or for violating any applicable pretreatment standard or requirement,
the city may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition
received from a user and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6),
determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial
user.

character or quantity that special and unusual attention is required for their
handling;
   4.   Pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with
the POTW;
   5.   Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity
in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater
which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to
exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40°C) unless the approval
authority, upon the request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits;

(Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.110: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards as amended and promulgated by
EPA pursuant to the act and as found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405–471, are applicable to all users and are hereby incorporated and shall be
enforceable under this chapter. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.120: STATE REQUIREMENTS:
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW contained in
“Rules Regulating the Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program” as
amended and promulgated by DEQ, and as found at IDAPA 58.01.25, shall be met by
all users which are subject to such standards and are hereby incorporated and
shall be enforceable under this chapter. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.130: LOCAL LIMITS:
The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through
and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of
the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits:
0.186 mg/l arsenic
0.260 mg/l cadmium
3.103 mg/l chromium
3.37  mg/l copper
0.65  mg/l cyanide
0.43  mg/l lead
0.002 mg/l mercury
2.17  mg/l nickel
0.24  mg/l silver
1.48  mg/l zinc
 
These apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of
the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal
unless indicated otherwise. The city administrator may impose mass limitations
in addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations above.
Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local
limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable
pretreatment standard shall apply. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.140: CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.150: SPECIAL AGREEMENT:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
federal pretreatment requirement. However, users may request a net gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.15.
They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard
from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.13. (Ord. 806
§2, 1996)
13.18.160: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The city administrator may impose mass limitations on users which
he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.170: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the DEQ, or the city administrator, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.180: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards
shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city
shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not
covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when
the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the federal
categorical pretreatment standards.
New sources and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days from the
beginning of discharge). New sources and new users shall install, shall have in
operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain
a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must
comply with a more stringent local limit which is in noncompliance with any
local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an
industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time
feasible. (Ord. 806 §2, 1996)
13.18.190: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the city administrator may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
B.   Each user discharging into the POTW greater than one hundred fifty
thousand (150,000) gallons per day or greater than ten percent (10%) of the
average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is less, shall install and maintain,
on the user's property and at the user's expense, a suitable storage and flow
control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty four (24) hour
period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least one hundred percent
(100%) of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a
rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the
city administrator. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the city administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city administrator and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at his expense.
D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required
to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. (Ord. 806
§2, 1996)
13.18.200: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS:
The city administrator may require any user to develop and implement an
accidental spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed
necessary by the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug
discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost
and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation. The city
shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan
to be submitted within ninety (90) days after notification by the city. The
city shall have sixty (60) days from receipt of same to review and comment on
the plan and the compliance schedule and to mandate any changes in either. Each
user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has
been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
A.   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention
plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:
   1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
   2.   Description of stored chemicals;
   3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug
discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the standards in sections
13.18.100 through
13.18.130 of this chapter; and
   4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
B.   Users shall notify the city wastewater treatment plant immediately after
the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated by
this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW,
in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under state or federal law.
C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the city administrator a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
D.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover

and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least ninety (90) days' advance
notice to the city administrator and the city administrator approves the
wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the city administrator must
include a written certification by the new owner and/or operator which:
A.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes;
B.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
C.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer.
Provided that the above occurs and that there were no significant changes to
the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner will be
considered an existing user and be covered by the existing limits and
requirements in the previous owner's permit. (Ord. 806 §3, 1996)
13.18.420: REVOCATION:
Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for, but not limited to, the
following reasons:

N.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the
wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations.
All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the
issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user. (Ord. 806 §3, 1996)
13.18.430: REISSUANCE:
A user who is required to have a wastewater discharge permit shall apply for
wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete wastewater
discharge permit application, in accordance with section
13.18.340 of this chapter, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user whose
existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who has submitted its
reapplication in the time period specified herein shall be deemed to have an
effective wastewater discharge permit until the city issues or denies the new
wastewater discharge permit. A user whose existing wastewater discharge permit
has expired and who failed to submit its reapplication in the time period
specified herein will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater
discharge permit. (Ord. 806 §3, 1996)
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
13.18.500: FINAL COMPLIANCE REPORT (INITIAL COMPLIANCE REPORT):
A.   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance of an
existing significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements set forth in this chapter, in federal categorical standards, or in
a wastewater discharge permit, or, in the case of a new source or a "new user"
considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, within ninety (90) days
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, the
affected user shall submit to the city a report containing the information
outlined in subsections
13.18.340D through F of this chapter.
B.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR section 403.6
(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 806 §4,
1996)
13.18.510: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
A.   Any user that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit and
performs self-monitoring shall submit to the city during the months of June and
December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the city, a
report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting
period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the
industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their
discharge at least twice per year.
B.   The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations
and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or
the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required
by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled
and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the city or by this
chapter, using methodologies in 40 CFR part 136, it must submit all results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
C.   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by
the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical
standards, shall report production data as outlined in subsection B of this
section.
D.   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or nonregulated
flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated
process flows, dilution flows and nonregulated flows.
E.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual
measurement is not feasible.
F.   Discharges sampled shall be representative of the user's daily operations
and samples shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in
sections
13.18.600 through
13.18.620 of this chapter.
G.   The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have an
industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent, or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
H.   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by the
user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare
the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the city agrees
to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user for such
monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and
analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall
be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no obligation to
perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user. (Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.520: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
B.   No increment referred to in subsection A of this section shall exceed nine
(9) months.
C.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports. (Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.530: NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES AND NOTIFICATION OF
CHANGES AT AN SIU FACILITY:
Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a
notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing
limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
In addition to the foregoing notification of production changes, all SIUs must
immediately notify the POTW of any changes at an SIU facility that may affect
the potential for a slug discharge. Such notification is sufficient grounds for
the POTW to re-evaluate the notifying SIU's need for a slug control plan or any
other actions the POTW deems necessary to prevent slug discharges. (Ord. 1203,
2021: Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.540: HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION:
A.   Required; Content:
   1.   Any user that is discharging more than fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of
hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in
a calendar month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide a
onetime notification in writing to the city, EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. Any existing user
exempt from this notification shall comply with the requirements contained
herein within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen
kilograms (15 kg) of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any discharge of
acutely hazardous wastes to the city sewer system.
Such notification shall include:
      a.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261;
      b.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
      c.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
   2.   If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred kilograms (100
kg) of such waste per calendar per month to the sewer system, the notification
shall also contain the following information to the extent it is known or
readily ascertainable to the industrial user:
      a.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes,
      b.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month, and
      c.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestreams
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
B.   Exception For Self-Monitoring:
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements.
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes
or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the
discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this section, an industrial user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.550: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG
LOADS:
Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges that could cause
problems to the POTW, including any slug loads, as defined in section
13.18.030 of this chapter. The notification shall include the concentration and
volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact
should also be noted during the notification. Any user who discharges a slug
load(s) of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the
POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city under state or
federal law. (Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.560: NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the city within eight (8) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling within five (5) days and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of
the violation. Where the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu
of the user, the city must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
analysis. Re-sampling is not required if:
A.   The city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per
month, or
B.   The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.570: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any substantial change
in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including
significant manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 806 §4, 1996)
13.18.580: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the city as the city administrator may require. (Ord.
806 §4, 1996)
13.18.590: RECORD KEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, including
documentation associated with best management practices, and any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by
the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date,
exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking
the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the
analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified
of a longer retention period by the city administrator. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord.
806 §4, 1996)
SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
13.18.600: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
A.   A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The city administrator
will determine on a case by case basis whether the user will be able to
composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, twenty four
(24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional
composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow
proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow
proportional composite sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be
obtained through time proportional composite sampling techniques or through a
minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
B.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities
if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing
process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by the city and
specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users, if
other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(e) in
order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment
standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to
factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations
necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).
C.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling,
and methods of analysis, and shall certify that the wastestream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in
its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR part 136, it
must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of
its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 806 §5, 1996)
13.18.610: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA and DEQ. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §5, 1996)
13.18.620: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections
13.18.600 and
13.18.610 of this chapter. (Ord. 806 §5, 1996)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
13.18.700: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the city administrator ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the city administrator will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B.   The city administrator shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the city administrator and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city administrator access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 806 §6, 1996)
13.18.710: MONITORING FACILITIES:
Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to
allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to
the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises,
except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The city administrator,
whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling
facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line
or a wastewater treatment system).
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, including the
sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
The city administrator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 806 §6, 1996)
13.18.720: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the city administrator has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the city administrator shall seek issuance of a search
and/or seizure warrant from the fifth district court of the city. Such warrant
shall be served at reasonable hours by the city administrator in the company of
a uniformed police officer of the city. (Ord. 806 §6, 1996)
13.18.730: VANDALISM:
No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord.
806 §6, 1996)
13.18.740: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during
the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall mean:
A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit
for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which
thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
C.   Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough (including
endangering the health of city personnel or the general public);
D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H.   Any other violation(s) which the city determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 806 §8,
1996)
ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.18.800: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the city administrator finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
administrator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation via
certified letter. Within five (5) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the city administrator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of
the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 806 §9,
1996)
13.18.810: CONSENT ORDERS:
The city administrator may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
13.18.830 and
 13.18.840 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a
consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.820: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The city administrator may order via a certified letter a user which has
violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the city administrator and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.830: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the city administrator finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
administrator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance
of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.840: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the city administrator finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city administrator may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.850: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
A.   When the city administrator finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
administrator may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent (10%)
per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
city administrator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the city administrator shall convene a hearing on the matter within
thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.860: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The city administrator may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
city administrator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city administrator shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The city administrator shall allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in section
13.18.870 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the city administrator prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under sections
 13.18.820 and
13.18.870 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
13.18.870: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (NONEMERGENCY):
In addition to the provisions in section
13.18.420 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume,
constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections
13.18.100 through
13.18.210 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.18.820 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 806 §9, 1996)
JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.18.900: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the city administrator finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
administrator may petition the 5th district judicial court through the city
attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user. (Ord. 806 §10, 1996)
13.18.910: CIVIL PENALTIES:
A.   A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum
civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In
the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B.   The city administrator may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user,
the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 806 §10, 1996)
13.18.920: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
A.   A user which has wilfully or negligently violated any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one
hundred eighty (180) days, or both.
B.   A user which has wilfully or negligently introduced any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) and/or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one
hundred eighty (180) days. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause
of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
C.   A user which knowingly made any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsified, tampered with,
or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or imprisonment for not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days, or both. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806
§10, 1996)
13.18.930: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The provisions in sections
13.18.740 through
13.18.1050 of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the
right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement in response to pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However,
the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken
concurrently. (Ord. 806 §10, 1996)
SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
13.18.1000: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The city administrator may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the city administrator to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 806 §11, 1996)
13.18.1010: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The city administrator may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 806 §11, 1996)
13.18.1020: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 806 §11, 1996)
13.18.1030: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the city administrator. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to any and all provisions of the city code governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or
remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 806 §11, 1996)
13.18.1040: INFORMANT REWARDS:
The city administrator may pay up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. (Ord. 806 §11,
1996)
13.18.1050: CONTRACTOR LISTING:
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale
of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or
services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance
with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion
of the city. (Ord. 806 §11, 1996)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
13.18.1100: UPSET:
A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
   1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
   2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
   3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within eight (8) hours of becoming aware of the upset
(if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within 5 days):
      a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
      b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if
not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
and
      c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim
of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §12,
1996)
13.18.1110: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections
13.18.100A and
13.18.100B3 through B7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and
that either: a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-
through or interference; or b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its IPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 1203, 2021: Ord. 806 §12, 1996)
13.18.1120: BYPASS:
A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
B.   Bypass Permitted: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this
section.
C.   Notice Of Bypass:
   1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
   2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24) hours
from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also
be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
D.   Bypass Conditions:
   1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action

wastewater collection system. Such fixtures shall include, but not be limited
to, sinks, dishwashers, garbage disposals, automatic hood and wash units, floor
drains in food preparation and storage areas, and any other fixture which is
determined to be a potential source of grease. Wastewater from sanitary
facilities and other similar fixtures shall not be introduced into the grease
interceptor or trap under any circumstances.
C.   Grease Traps: Grease traps shall be prohibited for new food service
facilities. They may be approved for those facilities where inadequate space is
available for the installation of a grease interceptor. Approval of the
installation of a grease trap instead of a grease interceptor at a new food
service facility shall meet the following criteria:
   1.   Trap Design And Location: Grease traps shall conform to the standards
in the Idaho standards for public works construction 2005 (ISPWC). Grease traps
shall be installed in strict accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Grease traps shall be equipped with a cover that can be opened for inspection
and sampling and mechanism for secure closing.
   2.   Trap Capacity: The capacity of the grease trap shall be related to the
flow rate as indicated in table 1 and the appendix of the Idaho standards for
public works construction 2005 (ISPWC) document.
   3.   Flow Through Rate: Flow through rates shall be calculated in accordance
with procedures in the Idaho standards for public works construction 2005
(ISPWC).
   4.   Flow Control Device: Grease traps shall be equipped with a device to
control the rate of flow through the unit. The rate of flow shall not exceed
the manufacturer's rate capacity recommended in gallons per minute for the
unit.
   5.   Venting: The flow control device and the grease trap shall be vented in
accordance with the Idaho plumbing code current edition. The vent shall
terminate not less than six inches (6") above floor rim level or in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.
   6.   Inspection, Cleaning And Maintenance: Each food service facility shall
be solely responsible for the cost of trap installation, inspection, cleaning
and maintenance. Each food service facility may contract with a grease hauler
who has been permitted by the city for cleaning services or it may develop a
written protocol and perform its own grease trap cleaning and maintenance
procedures. Cleaning and maintenance must be performed when the total volume of
captured grease and solid material displaces more than twenty percent (20%) of
the total volume of the unit. Each food service facility shall determine the
frequency at which their grease trap shall be cleaned, but all grease traps
shall be opened, inspected, cleaned and maintained at a minimum of once per
week by the owner.
   7.   Inspection: Grease traps shall be inspected by director or his designee
as necessary to assure compliance with the GMP and to assure proper cleaning
and maintenance schedules are being adhered to.
   8.   Repairs: The food service facility shall be responsible for the cost
and scheduling of all repairs to its grease trap(s). Repairs required by the
director or his designated official shall be completed within fourteen (14)
calendar days after the day of written notice of required repairs is received
by the facility, unless the city approves a different schedule in writing.
   9.   Disposal: Grease and salt materials removed from grease traps shall be
disposed of by the grease hauler at an approved site.
   10.   Recordkeeping: The food service facilities shall maintain records of
the date and time of all cleaning and maintenance of each grease trap in a
bound logbook and shall make this book available for inspection by the director
or his designated official on demand.
D.   Grease Interceptors: Grease interceptors shall be installed on all new
food service facilities except where physical space is limited as described in
this section. All new and existing grease interceptors shall meet the following
criteria:
   1.   Interceptor Design And Location: Grease interceptors shall have a
minimum of two (2) compartments and shall be capable of separation and
retention of grease and storage of settled solids. Interceptor design shall
conform to requirements of Idaho standards for public works construction 2005
(ISPWC). A control manhole over each compartment for monitoring purposes shall
be required and installed at the owner's/operator's sole expense. Covers shall
have a gastight fit and the lid shall say "SEWER" on it. The grease interceptor
shall be designed, constructed and installed for adequate load bearing
capacity. Flow control devices shall be required where the water flow through
the interceptor may exceed its rated flow. Interceptors shall be installed in a
location outside of the building which provides easy access at all times for
inspections, cleaning and proper maintenance, including pumping.
   2.   Interceptor Capacity: Grease interceptor capacity calculations shall be
performed by each food service facility based on size and type of operation
according to the formula contained in the Idaho standards for public works
construction 2005 (ISPWC). Minimum capacity in any one unit shall be at a
minimum one thousand (1,000) gallons as required by Idaho plumbing code and
maximum capacity shall be one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons. Where
sufficient capacity cannot be achieved with a single unit, installation of
grease interceptors in series is required. Interceptor capacity calculations
shall be approved by the director or his designated official prior to the
installation of the interceptor(s). The capacity of the grease interceptor
required for food manufacturing or processing facilities which are not covered
by the Idaho plumbing code shall be approved by the director or his designated
official according to the mass and type of food prepared, the wastewater volume
produced from food preparation or manufacture, total hours of operation per day
and load factor depending on the installed equipment.
   3.   Inspection, Pumping And Maintenance: Each food service facility shall
be responsible for the cost of installing, inspecting, pumping, cleaning and
maintaining its grease interceptor. All food service facilities that have
grease interceptors shall utilize a grease hauler who has been permitted by the
city for pumping services. Pumping services shall include the initial complete
removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom
sludges and solids from the interceptor. The return of gray water into the
grease interceptor from which the wastes were removed is allowable, provided
that the grease and solids are not returned to the interceptor and further
provided the grease hauler has written authorization from the food service
facility to return the gray water. Grease interceptor cleaning shall include
scraping excessive solids from the walls, floors, baffles and all pipe work.
The grease hauler shall wait at least twenty (20) minutes to allow the
interceptor waste to separate in the truck tank before attempting to
reintroduce the gray water to the interceptor. It shall be the responsibility
of each food service facility to inspect its grease interceptor during the
pumping procedure to ensure that the interceptor is properly cleaned out and
all fittings and fixtures inside the interceptor are in working condition and
functioning properly.
   4.   Interceptor Pumping Frequency: Each food service facility shall have
its grease interceptor(s) pumped at a minimum frequency of once every calendar
month. There shall be a minimum period of two (2) weeks between each required
pumping. In addition to required monthly pumping, each food service facility
shall determine an additional frequency at which its grease interceptor(s)
shall be pumped according to the following criteria:
      a.   When the floatable grease layer exceeds six inches (6") in depth as
measured by approved dipping method; or
      b.   When the settleable solids later exceed eight inches (8") in depth
as measured by approved dipping method; or
      c.   When the total volume of capture grease and solid materials
displaces more than twenty percent (20%) of the capacity of the interceptor as
calculated using an approved dipping method; or
      d.   During an inspection it is found that the interceptor is not
retaining/capturing oils and greases. The director or his designee can require
the interceptor to be pumped within twenty four (24) hours after the
inspection.
   5.   Variance Procedure: If a food service facility determines that monthly
pumping of their grease interceptor is unnecessary in order to remain in
compliance with the criteria of subsection D4 of this section, the facility may
make written application for a variance from the monthly pumping requirements
to the city. The variance procedures shall be as follows:
      a.   The food service facility shall submit an application for a variance
form provided by the city along with the appropriate application fee. The
application shall include the next day and time the facility intends to have
its interceptor pumped and cleaned.
      b.   The director or his designee shall observe the pump out procedure
and inspect the interceptor on the specified day and time.
      c.   If the interceptor is in good working condition during the initial
inspection, the director or his designee shall reinspect the interceptor
approximately one month after an initial inspection. If there are less than
four inches (4") of surface grease and less than six inches (6") of bottom
solids at the time of reinspection, the interceptor will not need to be pumped
out at that time.
      d.   After the initial reinspection, the director or his designee shall
inspect the interceptor at intervals of approximately every ten (10) working
days to determine degrees and solids level using a dipping method approved by
the city.
      e.   At the reinspection when either the level of grease reaches six
inches (6") or the level of solids exceeds eight inches (8"), the director or
his designee shall use the number of days from the initial pumping date to the
final reinspection date as the new pumping frequency requirements to be
included in a variance granted.
      f.   If, at reinspection, the level of grease exceeds six inches (6") or
the level of solids exceeds eight inches (8"), the director or his designee
shall use the number of days from initial pumping date to the previous
reinspection date as the new pumping frequency requirement to be included in
the variance granted.
   6.   Inspections: Grease interceptors shall be inspected by the director or
his designee as necessary to assure compliance with the GMP and to determine if
proper cleaning and maintenance schedules are being adhered to.
   7.   Repairs: Each food service facility shall be responsible for the cost
and scheduling of all repairs to its grease interceptor. Repairs required by
the director or his designee shall be corrected within fourteen (14) calendar
days after the date of written notice of requiring the repairs is received by
the facility or unless notice from the city establishes a different compliance
date.
   8.   Disposal: Wastes received from each grease interceptor shall be
disposed of at a facility permitted to receive such wastes or a location
designated by the city of Jerome for such purposes. Neither grease nor solid
materials removed from interceptors shall be returned to any grease
interceptor, private sewer line or to any portion of the city's wastewater
collection system or wastewater treatment facilities without prior written
permission from the city administrator or wastewater director.
   9.   Recordkeeping: Each food service facility shall maintain a bound
logbook in which a record of all interceptor maintenance is entered, including
the date and time of the maintenance, details of any repairs required and dates
of repair completion and any other records pertaining to the interceptor. This
logbook shall be made available for review upon request by the director or his
designee. Each food service facility shall also maintain a file on site which
contains the following information:
      a.   The (as built) drawings of the plumbing system.
      b.   A copy of the current grease discharge permit.
      c.   Records of inspections.
      d.   Copies of annual reports.
      e.   Receipts.
      f.   Log of pumping activities.
      g.   Log of maintenance activities.
      h.   Hauler information.
      i.   Disposal information.
      j.   Monitoring data.
The files shall be available at all times for inspection and review by the
director or designated official.
   10.   Annual Reporting: Each food service facility shall submit an annual
report to the city on a form provided by the city. Reports shall be submitted
on or before September 30 each year. Each report shall record the number of
times the interceptor trap has been cleaned since the last report and shall
indicate the volume of liquids and solids removed on each occasion and the name
and address of grease hauler. If a variance has been granted, the alternate
cleaning frequency shall also be reported. Each report shall also note any
repairs that have been made to the interceptor or trap including the dates that
these repairs were affected. Reports shall be submitted to the address provided
in the permit and shall be deemed to be late and subject to a late fee if they
are received by the city more than thirty (30) days after the end of the month
specified above.
   11.   Interceptor Additives: Any chemicals, enzymes, emulsifiers, live
bacteria or other grease cutters or additives shall be approved by the director
prior to their use by the food service facility or grease hauler. Material
safety data sheets (MSDS) and any other applicable information concerning the
composition, frequency of use and mode of action of the proposed additive shall
be sent to the city together with their written statement outlining the
proposed use of the additive(s). Based upon the information received and any
other information solicited from the potential user or supplier, the city shall
permit or deny the use of the additive in writing. Permission to use any
specified additive may be withdrawn by the city at any time.
   12.   Alterative Grease Removal Devices Or Technologies: Alternative devices
and technologies such as automatic grease removal systems shall be subject to
approval by the director prior to installation. Approval of the device shall be
based on demonstrated (proven) removal efficiencies and reliability of
operation. The city may approve these types of devices depending on
manufacturer's specifications on a case by case basis. The food service
facility may be required to furnish analytical data demonstrating that grease
discharge concentrations to the city's wastewater collection system will not
exceed the limitation established in this code. (Ord. 1045, 2008)
13.18.1230: FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES PERMITTING PROGRAM:
A.   Permitting Requirements For Food Service Facilities: Each food service
facility shall be evaluated to determine whether it falls within the definition
of a significant industrial user (SIU). Facilities classified as SIUs shall be
subject to permitting as provided in section
13.18.300 of this chapter. All food service facilities shall be required to
apply for and obtain a "grease discharge permit" or GDP, from the city. The
city shall approve, deny, or approve with special conditions all applications
for GDPs in accordance with the policies and regulations established herein.
The GDP shall be in addition to any other permits, registrations, or
occupational licenses which may be required by federal, state or local law. It
shall be a violation hereof for any food service facility identified by the
city to discharge wastewater containing fats, oils and grease to the city's
wastewater collection system without a current GDP.
B.   Application Form: The city shall provide an application form for a GDP.
The appropriate form shall be sent to all food service facilities identified by
the city. All food service facilities required under the terms of this program
to obtain a GDP shall submit a completed application form for a GDP to the city
at the address shown on the form within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of
the form. Each application form submitted shall include the following
information:
   1.   Name, address, telephone number and location (if different from the
address) of applicant, owner of the premises (if different from the tenant when
property is leased) from which fat, oils and greases are discharged, and the
name of a representative duly authorized to act on behalf of the food service
facility.
   2.   A description of the activities, facilities, and plant processes on the
premises, including a list of all equipment, raw materials and chemicals used

any other applicable federal, state or local regulations governing the food
service facility.
   8.   Any information determined by the city administrator or wastewater
director to be necessary in order to evaluate the GDP application.
C.   Application Procedure: Once a completed application form has been
received, the food service facility will be inspected prior to the issuance of
the GDP. During the prepermit inspection, the information contained in the
application form will be verified, the average daily potable water use will be
calculated and the permit fees determined, and the grease interceptor or trap
will be inspected. If all information is verified and the grease interceptor or
trap is in proper working condition, a GDP will be issued together with a copy
of the ordinance codified herein. If the grease interceptor or trap requires
any maintenance or repairs, or incorrect information has been given, the
director or his designated official shall provide a written notice to correct
any deficiencies, including a required time schedule for repairs to be
effective prior to a second prepermit inspection. Second prepermit inspections
shall be performed after a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days have elapsed to
allow for corrective action by the food service facility to occur. If the
facility is not in compliance at the second prepermit inspection, charges and
fees will be levied for future inspections. An application for a permit shall
be granted with conditions or denied within sixty (60) days after the date of
last prepermit inspection which the applicant's facility is in compliance.
D.   Grease Discharge Permit: The following criteria applied to all GDPs:
   1.   Each GDP shall be effective for a five (5) year period and shall have
an effective and an expiration date.
   2.   The GDP must be displayed in a conspicuous place or can be seen by the
staff of the food service facility and a copy of the GDP must be kept in the
records file.
   3.   The GDP shall be issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A
GDP shall not be transferred or sold to a new owner under any circumstances. A
new owner is required to apply for a new GDP.
   4.   An application for renewal of the GDP shall be submitted at least sixty
(60) days prior to the expiration date of the existing GDP by each applicant
wishing to continue to discharge into the wastewater collection system. Failure
to submit applications in a timely manner shall be a violation hereof.
   5.   The terms and conditions of the GDP are subject to modification by the
city during the term of the permit, if limitations or requirements in this
program are modified. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in the
issued permit at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the
change(s). Any changes or new conditions in the GDP shall include a reasonable
schedule for achieving compliance.
E.   Entry: Each food service facility shall allow the director or his designee
and other duly authorized employees or agents of the city bearing proper
credentials and identifications access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purpose of inspection, observation, records examination,

refusal of the food service facility to allow the director or his designee
entry to or upon the facility's premises for purpose of inspection, sampling
effluents or inspecting and copying records or performing such other duties as
shall be required hereby shall constitute a violation hereof. The city
administrator or his designee may seek a warrant or use such other legal
procedures as may be advisable and reasonably necessary to discharge his duties
pursuant hereto.
F.   Inspection: Inspection of all food service facilities shall be inspected
as follows:
   1.   Prepermit Inspections: Prepermit inspections shall be conducted by
director or his designee as outlined in this section.
   2.   Inspections: The director or his designee shall inspect food service
facilities on both an unscheduled and unannounced basis or on a scheduled basis
after a GDP has been issued for compliance with the requirements hereof. All
food service facilities with current GDPs shall be inspected. Inspections shall
include all equipment, food processing and storage areas and shall include a
review of the processes that produce wastewater discharged from the facility
through the grease interceptor or trap. The director or his designee shall also
inspect the interceptor or trap maintenance logbook and file, other pertinent
data, and the grease and interceptor or trap and may check the level of the
interceptor or trap contents and/or take samples as necessary. The director or
his designee shall require all observations in a written report. Any
deficiencies shall be noted, including, but not limited to:
      a.   Failure to properly maintain the grease interceptor or trap in
accordance with provisions of the grease discharge permit and these provisions.
      b.   Failure to report changes in operations, or wastewater constituents
and characteristics.
      c.   Failure to report pumping activities or keep copies of manifest

      d.   Failure to maintain logs, files, records or access for inspection or
monitoring activities.
      e.   Failure to obtain or renew the grease discharge permit in a timely
manner.
      f.   Any other inconsistency which program requires correction by the
food service facility is concerned.
If any deficiencies are recorded by the director or his designee during an
inspection, the director or his designee shall provide the food service
facility written notice to correct the deficiency within twenty one (21)
calendar days, and a tentative date for a first reinspection.
   3.   Reinspections: The director or his designee shall reinspect food
service facilities which receive deficiency notices after the original
inspection. The director or his designee shall inspect any repairs or any
deficiencies and shall provide written notice of compliance or noncompliance as
the case may be. In the event that the food service facility has returned to
compliance with all of the deficiencies, there shall be no charge for the
reinspection. In the event of continuing noncompliance, a successive
reinspection will be scheduled and appropriate fees shall be charged to the
food service facility concerned for the first and all successive reinspections.
A first reinspection shall be performed after a minimum of twenty one (21)
calendar days have elapsed to allow for corrective action by the food service
facility to be completed.
G.   Monitoring: The city shall have the right to sample and analyze the
wastewater from any food service facility at any time to determine compliance
with the requirements of this code. If violations of oil and grease limits are
detected, enforcement action may be initiated and demand monitoring costs
billed to the food service facility. (Ord. 1045, 2008)
13.18.1240: GREASE HAULER REGULATION PROGRAM:
A.   Administration And Permitting Of Grease Haulers: Any person, firm or
business desirous of collecting, pumping or hauling grease interceptor wastes
from businesses located within the municipal limits of Jerome, Idaho, who does
not hold and maintain a current Jerome city "grease waste hauler permit" shall
be required to apply for and obtain a "grease hauler permit (GHP)" from the
city. The director shall approve, deny, or approve with special conditions all
applications for GHPs in accordance with policies and regulations established

C.   Oversized Meter: Where a customer can demonstrate that the purpose of an
oversized meter is for irrigation or fully consumptive uses, then the city
administrator has the authority to bill based on the theoretical meter size
that would be necessary for servicing just the nonconsumptive potable usage
based on the adjustment schedule below. Such a modification would be subject to
review if at a later date additional data suggested that a larger meter would
be needed.
   1.   For meters greater than one inch (1"): Actual meter sizes can be
reduced according to the following adjusted sizes:
      Use 1" wintertime equivalent meter size for flows less than 1,032 cf (a
1" meter is 1.78 times the area of a 3/4" meter. 1.78*580 = 1,032)
      Use 1.5" wintertime equivalent meter size for flows between 1,032 and
2,320 cf (a 2" meter is 4 times the area of a 3/4" meter. 4*580 = 2,320)
      Use 2.0" wintertime equivalent meter size for flows between 2,320 and
4,125 cf
      Use 3.0" wintertime equivalent meter size for flows between 4,125 and
9,280 cf
   2.   For all single-family residential use a wintertime equivalent meter
size of three-fourths inch (3/4").
D.   Industrial Users With High Wastewater Strength: For industrial users with
high wastewater strength (400+ mg/l), high flows (generally 10,000+ gallons per
day), and/or unique wastewater characteristics as determined by the city
administrator or his/her designee, the base monthly fee will be determined
based on an equivalent residential unit (ERU) as calculated utilizing the
formula below. The usage fee will be per the user class above based on
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS), unless a
higher rate is justified based on unique wastewater characteristics or impacts
to the city's collection and treatment systems.
      ERUs = Flow*0.00135 + BOD*0.164 + TSS*0.0324 + Phos*0.39
 
Flow = Average daily flow (gallons/day)
BOD  = Average biochemical oxygen demand (pounds/day)
TSS  = Average total suspended solids (pounds/day)
Phos = Average phosphorous load (pounds/day)
 
For larger industries with individual discharge permits with the city, the city
may negotiate with the industry to develop a monthly base fee based on the
equivalent residential units permitted and a usage fee that is based on flow

of error being appealed and the appellant's grounds for modification thereof.
The grounds for appeal may be based on actual discharge data, to include
laboratory test results performed by a competent laboratory using sampling
techniques acceptable to the city, or recent technical information available in

13.20.080: REDUCTION IN CHARGES:
A.   The city shall establish by resolution at the earliest possible time a
system by which any user of the system may establish a reduction in any month's
user charge by demonstrating that all water as measured by meter, drawn by the
individual from the city's water system was not in fact returned to the
wastewater treatment plant. These regulations shall supplement existing
provisions for sprinkling rates contained elsewhere in this code, and shall be
directed toward such users who do not presently come within the sprinkling rate

Dispute as to the amount of a bill shall not justify the user in refusing to
pay the bill when due; in case of dispute the user shall give written notice to
the city clerk at the time of payment that the bill is disputed, stating the
amount and reasons for the dispute. The city will investigate the complaint and
afford the user a hearing before the mayor and council and if, following such
investigation and hearing, the city shall determine that the user's objections
are well founded then the city shall refund the amount of the overpayment, or
credit it upon the next monthly bill of the consumer. (Prior code §23-43)

which charge or fee is levied and assessed, and the city clerk shall, at the
time of certifying the city taxes, certify such delinquencies, together with
all penalties, to the tax collector of the county, and when so certified the
same shall be a lien upon the property and collectible as other charges. The

The following rules and regulations concerning the municipal water system are
prescribed as set forth in this chapter. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.020: RULE 1; RELOCATION OF SERVICE PIPE:
Whenever it is necessary to change the location of the service pipe for any
premises, due to a relocation of the city's mains, or in order to effect
economy, the city will install such service pipe in like size, furnish all
material and perform all work at its own expense, inside the property line of
the premises served, necessary to connect with the service in the new location,
whenever the conditions in such instances make any other arrangement unjust and
inequitable. Nothing in this rule shall be construed, however, as to estoppel
to the changing or relocating of the city's mains as the city elects. (Prior
code §27-6)
13.28.030: RULE 2; UNAUTHORIZED INTERFERENCE WITH CITY PROPERTY:
No mechanic, plumber, person or persons, not authorized agents of the city,
shall in any way tamper with, interfere with, or make repairs, connections or
replacements to any of the city's property. If a change or relocation of the
city's property is desired, the city must be notified of such a change, and if
the request for change is granted or approved, the change or relocation will be
made by the city's authorized agent at such time as is most convenient for the
city. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.040: RULE 3; UNAUTHORIZED TURN ON OR TURNOFF OF WATER:
No mechanic, plumber, person or persons, other than employees of the city,
shall be permitted or authorized to turn on or off the water the city has shut
off under any circumstances, for any premises, without permission of the city;
provided, however, that turnoffs may be made by persons other than city
employees in case service pipe or plumbing has burst and damage is resulting to
other property either of the city or the consumer. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.050: RULE 4; OWNER HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR WATER SERVICE CHARGES:
Owners of real property being provided domestic water service by the city shall
be responsible for all deposits, fees and charges for such services,
irrespective of whether the owner is the occupant of the real property or is
otherwise a consumer as referenced in this chapter. All applications for
domestic water service must be made by the owner of the real property to be
provided the services. Monthly bills shall be sent to the owner who has made
the application for domestic water service. If the account has become
delinquent, the owner of the real property to which the services have been
provided shall be mailed a notice of termination of services at least ten (10)
days prior to actual termination, which notice must also set forth the amount
of all delinquent charges and fees. All fees and charges not paid by the date
of termination shall be the responsibility of the owner of the real property.
(Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.060: RULE 5; RESERVATION OF RIGHT TO SHUT OFF WATER SERVICE:
A.   The city reserves the right at any time to shut off the water supply for
repairs, extensions, nonpayment of bills and other reasons. Notice of such
shutoff, in case of repairs and extensions, will be given when convenient and
if time permits. Not less than twenty four (24) hours' notice will be given
when shutoff is to be made for nonpayment of bills or violations of rules of
the city.
B.   The city shall use reasonable diligence to provide sufficient and
continuous service, and, having used reasonable diligence, shall not be liable
to the consumer for failure or interruption of such service, but shall remove
the cause thereof with all reasonable diligence. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.070: RULE 6; PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE REQUIREMENT:
A.   All persons having boilers, water tanks or other equipment supplied by
direct pressure from the city's mains, shall install a pressure relief valve,
or other device to serve the same purpose, so as to prevent excess pressure
forcing hot water and steam back into the water meter or mains of the city.
B.   The consumer failing to equip and install properly the necessary pressure
relief valve, or other device on the premises connected with the city water
meter and mains in such a way as to avoid steam or hot water being forced back
into such meter and mains belonging to the city, will be responsible for the
damage resulting therefrom and the city will bill the consumer for such damage.
If such damage results on two (2) or more occasions to the city's property on
or at the same premises, the city may discontinue all service until the
necessary correction is made so as to prevent a recurrence. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.080: RULE 7; PRIVATE INSTALLATION OF PLUMBING:
The consumer must install and maintain at his own expense all pipes and other
plumbing within the boundary line of his premises. Installation of plumbing,
pipe fittings or repairs to plumbing on private property is not a part of the
city's business or service. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.090: RULE 8; CITY NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGE DUE TO FREEZE UP:
The city shall not be responsible for damage resulting from freeze ups on any
part of the water pipes or other equipment inside the property lines of the
premises. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.100: RULE 9; CITY NOT OBLIGATED TO ASSIST IN THAWING PIPES:
The city is not obligated to perform any service in thawing of pipes, locating
leaks or other trouble inside the property line of any of its consumers. It
shall however, endeavor to assist the consumer in finding the cause of trouble
upon his premises whenever conditions will permit. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.110: RULE 10; PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR RIGHT OF ACCESS:
The public works director and employees duly designated by him, shall have
reasonable access to all real property supplied with water by the city's
delivery system for the purposes of installing water meters and reading the
same, and shall further inspect city property installed on said real property
which comprises part of the delivery or meter system, as required in this
chapter. (Ord. 627(SSS), 1980: prior code §27-6)
13.28.120: RULE 11; MAINTENANCE OF CITY FIXTURES:
Mains and pipes, apparatus, instruments, meters and materials supplied by the
city, shall remain its property, and shall be returned to it by the consumer in
the same condition as when received by the consumer, except for ordinary wear
and depreciation, and the city may at any time examine, change or repair its
property on the premises of the consumer, and may remove all such property at
the termination of service, or at any time thereafter. All damages or injury to
pipes, apparatus or materials of the city on the consumer's premises, caused by
an act or neglect of the consumer, shall be made good by the consumer. (Prior
code §27-6)
13.28.130: RULE 12; GROUND WIRE ATTACHMENT TO PLUMBING PROHIBITED:
All persons are strictly forbidden to attach any ground wire or wires to any
plumbing which is or may be connected to any service connection or main
belonging to the city. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.140: RULE 13; CITY AND CONSUMER LIABILITY LIMITATIONS:
Neither the city nor the consumer shall be liable to the other for any act or
omission caused directly or indirectly by strikes, labor troubles, accident,
litigation, United States, state or municipal interference, or other causes not
due to negligence, but the cause producing such an act or omission shall be
removed with all reasonable diligence. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.150: RULE 14; WRITTEN NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
A.   Whenever by any rule, written notice is required to be given, such notice
shall be deemed to be completed:
   1.   If given to the city, when delivered to the city clerk's office in the
city, to any person regularly employed in such office; if deposited in the post
office, postage prepaid, and registered, addressed to the city at such office;
   2.   If given to the consumer personally, or by delivery to some person
regularly employed in or residing at the place where service is rendered; or
deposited in the post office, postage prepaid, and registered, addressed to the
consumer at such place.
B.   If notice is served by mail, the usual time for transmission of the mail
between point of deposit and the place of delivery, but in no case to exceed
three (3) days, shall be added to the time within which notice, as prescribed
by the rules, is to become effective. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.160: RULE 15; REPRESENTATIONS NOT BINDING UNLESS IN WRITING:
No promises, representations or advice of any employee of the city shall be
binding unless made in writing over the signature of the mayor and city clerk.
(Prior code §27-6)
13.28.170: RULE 16; WATER SERVICE RESALE PROHIBITED:
In no case will water service be furnished for resale purposes where the city
itself furnishes retail service of the same class or classes. (Prior code §27-
6)
13.28.180: RULE 17; EXTENSION WITHIN CORPORATE LIMITS:
A.   Extension, as contemplated in these rules, is as follows:
   1.   A branch from or continuation of an existing main or service pipe, or
both, to serve new business;
   2.   The changing of any main or service now installed to meet the
consumer's requirements;
   3.   Any increase of capacity of any existing extension. It may consist of
mains, service pipes, meters, connections and other materials; provided,
however, that extensions within the meaning of this rule shall not include
connection lines, pipes, taps and service lines on private property, which are
required to be installed and maintained at the consumer's expense pursuant to
rule 7 and all rules supplemental thereto.
B.   Whenever an applicant for service is not on an existing main, or a
consumer's operations are not located upon a completed main of such capacity as
to enable the city to furnish the service desired by the consumer, extensions
from the nearest available main to the applicant's or consumer's place of
operation will be made upon the following conditions:
   1.   The city shall not construct nor pay for the construction of water
distribution lines or laterals or other extensions which are not shown and
described in the maps, plans and specifications concerning the system now on
file in the office of the city clerk;
   2.   Any such lines or laterals or other extensions when needed shall be
constructed by the applicants for water service through or from the system, and
at their expense, including, but not limited to, a reasonable charge by the
city for city engineering, supervision and inspection, in accordance with the
specifications prescribed by the city engineer;
   3.   Any such lines or laterals or other extensions upon their connection to
the system shall become a part of the municipal water system owned, operated
and maintained by the city; provided, however, that except in the case of
subdivisions which are subject to the city's subdivision ordinance, copies of
which are on file in the office of the city clerk, extensions may be made at
city expense, either in whole or in part, in those cases where in the judgment
of the city exercised prior to commencement of construction thereof, such
extension will be in the best interests of the city.
13.28.190: RULE 18; ABANDONMENT OF SERVICE:
When the owner, at any time after the first year of service, entirely suspends
operations, with the intention to permanently abandon them, he may procure
cancellation of the contract upon written application to the city, made not
less than sixty (60) days before the effective date of such proposed
cancellation. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.200: RULE 19; ENLARGEMENT OF TAP AND SERVICE PIPE:
Where the owner desires the enlargement of his tap and service pipe because of
inadequacy and was not restricted in size by the city at the time of
installation, such enlargement will be made only at the owner's cost and
expense. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.210: RULE 20; FIRE HYDRANT SERVICE EXTENSION; GENERALLY:
Extensions and installations for fire hydrant service shall be as provided for
and set out under schedule 5, on file in the office of the city clerk. (Prior
code §27-6)
13.28.220: RULE 21; PRIVATE HYDRANT SERVICE EXTENSION:
A.   All installations or extensions for private fire hydrants or service as
provided for under schedule 2, on file in the office of the city clerk, shall
be as follows: All expenses for installation shall be paid for in cash by the
applicant before installation is made. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.230: RULE 22; EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE EXTENSION:
In all territory located outside of the corporate limits of the city, where the
city has a sufficient source of water and sufficient capacity in its mains
running parallel with the property for which service is desired, the city may
permit a connection thereto in the manner herein prescribed for property within
its corporate boundaries. An owner will be required to effect a satisfactory
conveyance of the fee title or an appropriate right of way as easement to any
not owned by the owner on which any connection is situated free of all liens
and encumbrances. All connections to and users of the water system outside the
corporate boundaries of the city are subject to the prior right of the city and
its inhabitants to the complete and full use of the system to the exclusion of
all present or future connectors or users. Water shall be used outside the
corporate limits only when it is above that necessary for the city's present
needs, and determination of the needs and requirements of the city and its
inhabitants with respect to water from its system is a fact to be determined by
the city council in its own sound discretion to be exercised from time to time
as occasion may require. While it is the purpose of the city to maintain a
water supply adequate to meet the needs of both the city and owners outside its
corporate limits and within the metropolitan area, there are many elements
which make it uncertain whether the supply can always be adequate for all, and
therefore in times of shortage, water service outside the city will be
curtailed on an equitable basis to be determined by the city council. (Ord.
1093, 2012)
13.28.240: RULE 23; FIRE HYDRANT CHARGES:
Charges for fire hydrants which are at this time installed, and future
installations shall be as provided for under schedule 5, on file in the office
of the city clerk. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.250: RULE 24; GATE VALVE INSTALLATION ON FIRE HYDRANTS:
Gate valves will be installed by the city upon all fire hydrants, standpipes
and other similar structures, whether public or private, so as to permit them
to be turned off without disconnecting service on any main. It is not intended
by this rule to require gate valves to be installed immediately on all
hydrants, standpipes and other similar structures now existing, but that the
valves shall be installed from time to time as the equipment referred to is
replaced or new installations are made. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.260: RULE 25; UNAUTHORIZED OPENING OF HYDRANTS:
No person, acting either for himself or as the agent of any person, persons,
firm, corporation or municipality, not authorized by the city, shall take any
water from any hydrant. Members of the fire department shall have authority to
open hydrants only for purposes in connection with firefighting or fire
protection operation. In the event water is desired from a fire hydrant, for
other than firefighting or fire protection operations, permission must be
obtained from the city to draw water from such fire hydrant. Such consent shall
not be given by the city until satisfactory arrangements have been made
concerning the condition and limitations for the service and the payment
thereof as provided for in schedule 4, on file in the office of the city clerk.
(Prior code §27-6)
13.28.270: RULE 26; PRIVATE FIRE HYDRANTS GENERALLY:
The use of water through an unmetered private fire service or tap, except for
testing purposes, is not allowed. The city may, at its option, seal the valves
on such fire lines, which seals may be broken only in case of fire. In the
event a test of the fire line is desired, the city must be notified and the
seals broken only in the presence of the city's agent. Any violation of this
regulation shall be sufficient cause for the city to discontinue the service.
Such service will not again be granted until satisfactory arrangements have
been made with the city concerning payment for water drawn from such fire
hydrant or service in the past and up until the time of disconnection, and then
only on a metered basis at the rate applicable. Nothing in this rule is to be
construed as an estoppel to the city metering the private fire service whenever
it desires, but the metered rate shall not apply in such case unless improper
use of water from such private fire service is disclosed by the meter. The city
may, with consent of the property owner, connect to the private fire service
for any premises, lines supplying domestic service for the same premises or
building. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.280: RULE 27; HAULERS AND CARRIERS:
No tap or service upon any premises shall be used by any other person, persons,
firm or corporation except those occupying or in charge of the premises to
which such tap or service is extended, unless provision is made for haulers and
carriers at the time of the signing of the regular application for service.
(Prior code §27-6)
13.28.290: RULE 28; FEE FOR CONSUMER SUPPLYING PREMISES OF ANOTHER:
Whenever any consumer (tap or service), coming within schedule 1, on file in
the office of the city clerk, shall permit any other person or persons, firm or
corporation, to take water from such consumer's premises without written
consent of the city, a charge of one dollar ($1.00) per month shall be made
against such consumer for each additional premises receiving, by carrier or
otherwise, water from such consumer's premises. Such charge is to be made
monthly in accordance with schedule 1, and the consumer, refusing to pay such
additional charge, shall be deemed a delinquent consumer, and dealt with
according to the rules of the city. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.300: RULE 29; COMMUNITY HYDRANT:
The city at all times shall maintain at least one hydrant or standpipe, more or
less centrally located, in the city, where water can be had in cans, barrels or
tank lots during regular business hours, as provided for in schedule 6, on file
in the office of the city clerk. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.310: RULE 30; METERS; GENERALLY:
Meters will be installed between the curbing and the sidewalk, or in the
sidewalk in front of the premises to be served, whenever possible. The city
reserves the right to install the meter at any other location it may deem
advisable. Whenever a meter is installed in the basement of the premises of a
consumer, or upon any other part of the consumer's premises, the city shall
secure the consent of such consumer for such installation, and when such
installation has been properly made the city shall not be held liable for any
damage resulting directly or indirectly from such installation unless
negligence is shown. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.320: RULE 31; METER; INSTALLATION:
In any building where the meter is to be installed in the basement, the
incoming water pipe must be so installed that it enters the basement at least
sixteen inches (16") from the riser in order that a meter can be set in a
horizontal position. All pipes to the different parts of the buildings or
grounds must take off from the consumer's service pipe at least one foot (1')
from the installed meter. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.330: RULE 32; METER; READING:
All water delivered by the city shall, except as specifically provided for in
schedules 2 and 5, on file in the office of the city clerk, be paid for
according to the measurement by meter or other measurements. For the purpose of
determining the amount of water delivered, the reading of each meter installed
shall be deemed conclusive as to the amount of water delivered through it,
unless upon being tested, such meter shall be found to register inaccurately,
in which event the provisions of these rules and regulations applicable
thereto, and as hereinafter provided, shall govern. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.340: RULE 33; METER; RATE PRIOR TO INSTALLATION:
Any service which is now installed, or which may hereafter be installed,
without a meter, is to be charged for on the minimum rate for such service as
may be described in any of the city's schedules until such time as a meter is
regularly installed. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.350: RULE 34; METER; TESTING:
A.   The city reserves the right to test any meter, at any time when it deems
it necessary, at its own expense.
B.   Whenever a meter, at the request of a consumer or at the option of the
city, has been tested within the eighteen (18) month period immediately
preceding a consumer's request for the testing of the meter, the consumer shall
be required to deposit the sum of one dollar ($1.00) with the city, and the
city's meter will be tested at the consumer's premises. The consumer will be
notified in advance and may be present or represented at such test. If upon
examination and the test, the meter is found to overregister more than three
percent (3%), another meter will be substituted therefor. The fee of one dollar
($1.00) so deposited in such cases will be repaid to the depositor and the
water bills adjusted to correct the error discovered, but in no case shall
adjustment of such error be made for a greater period than three (3) months. If
the meter shall be found to register less than three percent (3%) in excess of
the actual flow, or to register less than the actual quantity of water passing
through it, the fee of one dollar ($1.00) so deposited by the consumer will be
retained by the city, as compensation for the time required in making such
test. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.360: RULE 35; METER; RATE ESTIMATE IN EVENT OF FAILURE:
Should a meter fail to register, the water used will be estimated at:
A.   That of the same month of the previous year; or
B.   The average of the several preceding months on record. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.370: RULE 36; METER; MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:
Where a meter is installed upon the premises of a consumer, such consumer
shall, at all times, make it possible for the city or its representative to
read, test or repair such meter. Such consumer shall be liable to the city for
damages resulting to said meter, where such damage is directly caused by the
consumer, the immediate members of his family, his agents or employees. Where a
meter is installed in the sidewalk or curbing, the consumer will use every
effort to protect such meter from wilful or malicious destruction, together
with all other exposed property which may belong to the city, and which has
been used for the installation of such consumer's service. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.380: RULE 37; TURNON REQUIREMENTS:
A.   The city is not obligated to turn the water on for any person at any
premises until an "application for service" has been signed at the office of
the city, and schedule of service selected by the responsible party or his
agent, and the rules of the city providing for the payment of future water
bills, as set out by the rules hereinafter provided for, have been complied
with.
B.   No rate contract or application is assignable from one user to another,
except upon a written agreement of all parties concerned. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.390: RULE 38; CITY NONCOMPLIANCE TO TELEPHONIC REQUESTS:
The risk of noncompliance by the city to telephonic requests to have water
turned off or on at any premises, or for other purposes, is entirely assumed by
the person ordering. The failure of the city to perform work when so requested
will in no case be a reason for adjustment. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.400: RULE 39; CASH DEPOSIT; REQUIRED:
Upon signing the application for service, all owners of every kind and
description, excepting federal, state, county, municipal, religious and
charitable institutions, shall make a cash deposit securing the credit and the
payment for the service rendered by the city. The owners above exempt from
making said cash deposit shall be considered to have already established their
credit, but such owners are not exempted from the requirements of the other
rules of the city pertaining to an owner's credit, its establishment and
continuation. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.410: RULE 40; CASH DEPOSIT; RATES:
The city shall require deposit from all owners, except those referred to in
section
13.28.400, "Rule 39; Cash Deposit; Required", of this chapter, to secure the
payment of all bills as they mature. Such required deposit for owners shall be
a sum as fixed from time to time by resolution of the council. Deposits shall
not exceed the amount of an estimated ninety (90) days' bill of the owner. Upon
a user ceasing to be serviced by the system, any balance remaining of the
deposit shall be returned to the user upon proof of payment of all charges and
fees through the date of final use. The deposit shall also be returned to the
user upon timely payment in full of all user charges for a twelve (12)
consecutive month period. In the event the water service to an account is shut
off for reason of nonpayment and the deposit has already been returned, a new
deposit shall be required at the time services are restored. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.420: RULE 41; CASH DEPOSIT; APPLICATION TO AMOUNTS DUE:
The city shall have the right to apply such deposit to the payment of all
amounts due and owing from the owner, and if the owner shall fail to restore
any such deposit, upon ten (10) days' notice in writing, delivered personally
or by mail, the time of notice to be computed from the date of personal
delivery or date of mailing, the city, without further notice, may discontinue
service until the deposit is restored. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.430: RULE 42; BILLS; BILLING INTERVALS:
Bills are due on the date of bill, which, normally, will be rendered as nearly
as practicable at monthly intervals for all water service furnished during the
preceding month, as herein defined; but the city, at its option, may render
bills to regular owners at other, but in the case of residence owners, not
shorter, intervals; provided, that any owner may be billed at termination of
service. Temporary owners of any class may be billed at any time at the option
of the city. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.440: RULE 43; BILLS; NET RATES:
Net rates, if provided for in the schedule, are allowed on monthly bills only
when bill is paid in full at the city's office within ten (10) days after date
of bill, and on bills rendered at more frequent intervals, when paid within
three (3) days after date of bill, unless otherwise provided in the schedule
under which service is rendered, and when no previous bill for service remains
unpaid, unless disputed under section
13.28.450, "Rule 44; Bills; Disputed Amounts", of this chapter. Failure to
receive bill will not excuse failure to pay so as to entitle the consumer to
the net rate. When the last day of the application of net rate falls on a legal
holiday, the net rate will be allowed on the next business day. When
remittances are made by mail, the bills shall be deemed paid on the date of
mailing as shown by the postmark. (Prior code §27-6)
13.28.450: RULE 44; BILLS; DISPUTED AMOUNTS:
A dispute as to the amount of a bill, or the credits to be allowed against the
same, shall not justify the owner in refusing to pay the bill when due, but if
the owner shall give written notice at the city's office, at the time of
payment (which must be before the delinquent date) that the bill is disputed,
stating the amount and reasons of the dispute, the city will forthwith
investigate such complaint and if such investigation shall disclose that the
owner's objections are well founded, the city will refund the amount of the
overpayment, or credit it upon the next monthly bill of the owner. (Ord. 1093,
2012)
13.28.460: RULE 45; BILLS; DELINQUENT:
(Rep. by Ord. 1077, 2010)
13.28.470: RULE 46; BILLS; VIOLATION OF REGULATIONS DEEMED DELINQUENCY:
If a violation has resulted in the user or owner securing water without paying
for it, as provided for in these schedules, rates, rules and regulations, the
city shall estimate the amount of water so used and the service of such owner
shall be considered delinquent, and is not to be reconnected or continued until
after this estimated bill has been adjusted. (Ord. 1093, 2012)
13.28.480: RULE 47; BILLS; DISCONTINUANCE OF ACCOUNT:
Accounts will be continued and water bills rendered regularly until the city

A.   The project area as defined in the third amended South Lincoln plan is a
deteriorated or a deteriorating area as defined in the law 1  and the act 2
and qualifies as an eligible urban renewal area under the law and act,
including under the act a deteriorated area consisting of open land.
B.   The rehabilitation, conservation, and redevelopment of the project area
pursuant to the third amended South Lincoln plan is necessary in the interest
of public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city of Jerome.
C.   There continues to be a need for the agency to function in the city of
Jerome.
D.   The third amended South Lincoln plan conforms to the comprehensive plan of
the city of Jerome.
E.   Specifically the city council finds that sufficient park and recreational
facilities exist within close proximity of the project area. Certain

accessibility to those park and recreational facilities, specifically the
installation of traffic signals which allow crossing of South Lincoln and
result in greater safety for users of those park and recreational facilities
including children who reside and will reside within the South Lincoln project
area and the improvements to the public parking lots. In addition, certain park
or recreational improvements have been proposed within the project area.
F.   The third amended South Lincoln plan affords maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the city as a whole for the rehabilitation
and redevelopment of the project area by private enterprises.
G.   The third amended South Lincoln plan provides a feasible method for
relocation of any displaced families residing within the project area.
H.   The base assessment roll of the third amended project area does not exceed

in the law and act have been met. (Ord. 940 §2, 2003)
14.08.030: HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:
One of the third amended South Lincoln plan objectives to increase the
residential opportunity to include affordable housing does meet the sound needs
of the city and will provide housing opportunity in an area that does not now
contain such opportunity, and that portion of the project area which is
identified for nonresidential uses is necessary and appropriate to facilitate
the proper growth and development standards in accordance with the objectives
of the comprehensive plan to overcome economic disuse, the need for improved
traffic patterns and the need for the correlation of this area with other areas
of the city. (Ord. 940 §3, 2003)

The city council hereby finds and declares that the third amended revenue
allocation area as defined in the third amended South Lincoln plan, includes
that portion of the third amended project area, the equalized assessed
valuation of which the council hereby determines is in and is part of the third
amended South Lincoln plan, is likely to continue to increase as a result of

they are not acting in an ex officio capacity but rather as private citizens
who, although they are also members of the city council, are exercising their
independent judgment as private citizens when they sit on the board. Except for
the powers to appoint and terminate board members and to adopt the third
amended South Lincoln plan the city council recognizes that it has no power to
control the powers or operations of the agency. (Ord. 940 §9, 2003)
14.08.100: COUNCIL AS BOARD:
So long as any agency bonds are outstanding, the city council will not exercise

southeast industrial project area and southeast industrial revenue allocation
area are deemed "open land", the criteria set forth in the law and act have
been met. (Ord. 986 §2, 2005)
14.12.030: GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT:
That portion of the project area which is identified for nonresidential uses is
necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development
standards in accordance with the objectives of the comprehensive plan to
overcome economic disuse, the need for improved traffic patterns and the need
for the correlation of this area with other areas of the city. (Ord. 986 §3,

revenue allocation area as defined in the southeast industrial plan includes
that portion of the southeast industrial project area, the equalized assessed
valuation of which the council hereby determines is in and is part of the
southeast industrial plan and is likely to continue to increase as a result of
the initiation and completion of urban renewal projects pursuant to the
southeast industrial plan. (Ord. 986 §7, 2005)

The city council hereby approves and adopts the following statement of policy
relating to the appointment of city council members as members of the agency's

line and grade in an acceptable manner, the installation may be deferred until
street or road improvements are completed.
   4.   Curb and gutter installation may be deferred if, in the opinion of the
public works director, the installation at the time of building permit issuance
would create a traffic hazard or an unusual drainage problem.

aesthetic reasons, curve and wind in accordance with these standards, but such
trafficways shall maintain a grid type pattern approximately one-fourth (1/4)
of a mile square.
B.   Stub Streets: Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of
streets in new subdivisions shall be such that said streets extend to the
boundary line of the tract to make provisions for the future extension of said
streets into adjacent areas. A vehicular nonaccess reserve strip may be
required and held in public ownership. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be required.
C.   Relation To Topography: Streets shall be arranged in proper relation to
topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets and acceptable
gradients.
D.   Alleys: Alleys shall be provided in multiple dwelling or commercial
subdivisions unless other provisions are made for service access and off street
loading and parking. Dead end alleys shall be prohibited in all cases.
E.   Cul-De-Sac Streets: Cul-de-sac streets shall not be more than one thousand
feet (1,000') in length and shall terminate with an adequate turnaround having
a minimum radius of fifty feet (50') for the right of way.
F.   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where unusual
circumstances make such necessary to the reasonable development of a tract.
Special justification shall be presented for such a variance request to the
commission. Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing half or
partial street, the other part of the street shall be dedicated within such
tract. A vehicular nonaccess reserve street may be required and held in public
ownership.
G.   Private Streets: Private street construction standards shall be based upon
the following standards and the reasonable recommendations of the City
Engineer. Private streets are intended for infill development only.
   1.    The city will not accept a private street for public use or
maintenance.
   2.    Adequate construction standards may vary depending on the size of the
development and the demands placed on such improvements. The following are
minimum requirements that shall be met in every infill development:
      a.    A private street cannot be a through street.
      b.    Private streets will be allowed to serve up to ten (10) lots or
twenty-four (24) residential lots.
      c.    Required street width shall be determined according to the
following table, but under no circumstances shall any road or street be
constructed with a width of less than twenty-five (25) feet.
 
Minimum Street Width With Parking On-Street Total Street Width
25'                  N/A                    25'
25'                  8' - one side          33'
25'                  16' - both sides       41'
 
      d.    Private streets without parking, or parking on one side, shall be
posted as fire lanes with no parking allowed.
      e.    The city shall, at the developer's sole expense, make, install and
maintain street signs on private streets at approved locations. The financial
obligations for the sign or signs shall be the owners of properties which front
upon such streets.
      f.    The developer shall provide covenants, conditions and restrictions
relative to the property being platted or mapped establishing the party or
parties responsible for the repair and maintenance of the private street,
binding said parties and their successors and assigns to perform such repair
and maintenance and including provisions for the funding thereof.
      g.    Easement: The private street shall be constructed on a perpetual
ingress/egress easement or a single platted lot that provides access to all
properties served by such private street.
      h.    All private streets shall be paved.
   3.    Private streets will be reviewed during the subdivision and/or lot
splitting process. In order for the Planning and Zoning Commission to approve a
lot split or a preliminary plat; or for the City Council to approve a final
plat, the City Engineer and Fire Chief or their designee shall provide the
following testimony:
      a.    The proposed private street is clearly identified on the plat.
      b.    The design of the private street meets the requirements of this
article and the reasonable requirements of the City Engineer.
      c.    Granting approval of the private street would not cause damage,
hazard, or nuisance, or other detriment to persons, property, or uses in the
vicinity; and
      d.    The use and location of the private street shall not conflict with
the comprehensive plan and/or the transportation plan. (Ord. 994 §2, 2006; Ord.
1177, 2019)

D.   Drainage To U.S. Waters Or Canals: No drainage shall be allowed from a
building site directly to any waters of the United States or to any privately
owned canal system.
E.   Residential Subdivisions:
   1.   All residential subdivisions shall design and construct stormwater
retention facility or facilities to retain the 25-year, 24-hour rainstorm
event.
   2.   The stormwater shall be detained and released over a forty eight (48)
hour period or at a rate that is approved by the North Side Canal Company or by
any other entity that may govern the waterway downstream.
   3.   The stormwater dischargers releasing water from their retention area
shall use best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the amount of pollutants
from the water. Discharge water quality shall comply with the most current
regulations or standards that may apply.
   4.   The retention facilities shall also have an overflow device that can
convey the 100-year, 24-hour rainstorm event, without damage to the retention
facility. This structure should be designed to minimize any downstream safety
problems.
   5.   Storm sewers shall be placed in a public right of way or minimum
fifteen foot (15') wide easement. Easements shall also be required for the
retention areas. The city reserves the right to modify the retention facilities
to stay in compliance with any state or federal regulation.
F.   Commercial And Industrial Developments: All commercial and industrial
developments shall design and construct stormwater retention facilities to
retain the 50-year, 24-hour rainstorm event. Refer to subsection
16.34.020A3b of this chapter to determine the volume requirements. No discharge
of stormwater will be allowed from these areas.
G.   Procedure For Review And Approval Of The Stormwater Management Plan:
Note: Review and approval by the city does not constitute an engineering review
of project plans and calculations. The review is for the purpose of ensuring
general conformance to city policies and requirements. The submitting engineer
is solely responsible for the design. All submissions to the city shall be
stamped by a professional engineer registered in the state.
The following shall be submitted to the city:
   1.   A topographic survey of the development showing all drainage and
irrigation water conveyance systems within the area encompassed by a line two
hundred feet (200') outside the property line.
   2.   Peak flow calculations, with peak flows delineated on the drawings.
   3.   Runoff volume calculations.
   4.   Plans and profiles of new or modified drainage and irrigation water
conveyance systems.
   5.   Plans, profiles and calculations for stormwater retention or detention
facilities.
   6.   Flood routing computations for the 100-year flood through any existing
drainage conveyance systems.
   7.   Maintenance and operation manuals for stormwater facilities.
   8.   Infiltration rates where applicable.
   9.   Seasonal high ground water table elevations where applicable. This
applies when the absorption of stormwater is used as a best management
practice. Facilities using absorption designs shall not intercept the
postdevelopment ground water table. The bottom of the facility shall have a
minimum four foot (4') vertical separation from the seasonal high ground water
elevation and bedrock. The four foot (4') separation between the bottom of the
facility and the seasonal high ground water table shall contain a sandy loam
material to treat the water prior to entering the ground water. If the best
management practices are utilized to pretreat the water prior to discharge into
the absorption facility, the requirement for four feet (4') of sandy loam will
be waived.
The seasonal high ground water table elevation shall be established and used
for the facility design. The elevation of the seasonal high ground water table
shall be determined by a monitoring well established at the facility site and
monitored during the high ground water season. If available, ground water
records may be used to establish the probable highest ground water elevation.
The high ground water elevation shall be shown on the plans and be referenced
to a nearby bench mark; the latitude and longitude of the well shall be shown
on the plans. If ground water is encountered during construction of the
facility at an elevation higher than that shown on the plans, the facility
shall be redesigned to account for the higher elevation.
   10.   Soil classifications where applicable.
   11.   Flood routing of the 100-year storm to the ultimate drainage system.
   12.   Copies of associated permits and discharge agreements.
   13.   Copy of the pollution prevention plan that is on file with EPA for the
development. Prior to beginning of construction on any development site larger
than five (5) acres, the developer or their representative must have a
pollution prevention plan in place and must file a notice of intent (NOI) with
the EPA, in accordance with NPDES (national pollutant discharge elimination
system) requirements. The pollution prevention plan will include provisions for
reducing sediment discharges from the construction site and tracking of mud
onto roadways. A copy of this plan and the NOI shall be provided to the city
prior to any site grading. Refer to 40 CFR chapter 1, section 122.26,
stormwater discharges for NPDES requirements. (Ord. 994 §2, 2006)
16.34.020: DRAINAGE STUDY AND CALCULATION REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER
MANAGEMENT:
A.   The drainage study and conceptual plan shall be submitted under the
following concepts:
   1.   Drainage Patterns: Drainage flows of all frequencies should enter and
depart from the property to be developed in substantially the same manner as
predevelopment conditions.
   2.   Street Relationships/Emergency Access: All lots, structures, etc.,
within a development shall be accessible by at least one route during a 100-
year storm with a maximum street water depth of one foot (1'). In all cases,
the flow of water shall be contained within rights of way.
   3.   Retention Facility: In order to reduce the storm runoff as much as
feasible, retention facilities shall be sized for local (on site) stormwater
using the following procedures:
      a.   The design frequency shall be the 25-year storm, using the 24-hour
rainfall depth "D" as determined from the national weather services for Idaho.
For the Jerome area the 24-hour rainfall on a 25-year storm frequency is 1.6
inches.
      b.   Volume requirements for the retention facility are calculated by the
following method:
 
(Vt) * (12) = (1.6) * (A), where
Vt   = Volume required in acre feet
1.6  = 24 hour rainfall depth in inches on a 25-year storm frequency
A    = Tributary area
 
   4.   Side Slopes: Where possible, the retention facility shall have four to
one (4:1) side slopes.
   5.   Parking In Floodplains; Commercial: Parking within the 100-year
floodplain shall be allowed provided that there are no unattended vehicles and
that there is no substantial obstruction to the free flow of water. If the
depth of water exceeds one foot (1') during the base flood, the parking area
shall be signed to show the parking area is subject to periodic flooding. (Ord.
994 §2, 2006)

17.10.010: PURPOSES AND RESTRICTIONS:
For the interpretation of this title the zoning districts have been formulated
to realize the general purposes as set forth in this title. In addition, the
specific purpose of each zoning district are as stated in section
17.10.020 of this chapter. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.10.020: DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED:
The following zoning districts are hereby established with the specific
purposes stated below:
A.   R residential districts: To provide regulations and districts for various
residential uses. Centralized water and sewer facilities are required for all
subdivision and lot split applications submitted after the effective date
hereof in all residential and other districts. The four (4) residential
districts focus on the following residential uses:
   1.   Residential one (R-1): Single-family dwellings.
   2.   Residential two (R-2): Single or two-family dwellings.
   3.   Residential three (R-3): Single-family, two-family and multi- family
dwellings.
   4.   Multi-family residential (R-M): "Multiple-family dwellings", defined as
dwellings for three (3) families or more.
B.   C-1 neighborhood business district: To permit the establishment of
convenience business uses which tend to meet the daily needs of the residents
of an immediate neighborhood while establishing development standards that
prevent adverse effects on residential uses adjoining a C-1 district. Such
districts are typically appropriate for small shopping clusters or integrated
shopping centers located within residential neighborhoods. (Formerly NS -
neighborhood services.)
C.   C-2 general business district: To permit the establishment of areas for
commercial uses allowed in other commercial zones and commercial uses which are
more intensive than those permitted in other commercial zones. Uses that
complement rather than compete with the uses allowed within the CBD zoning
district shall be encouraged.
D.   C-3 high density business district: To permit the establishment of areas
for travel related services such as hotels, motels, service stations, drive-in
restaurants, offices, limited warehousing, commercial services and retail
sales. This district is specifically designed in clusters to service the
motoring public on major streets. Uses that compete with the uses allowed
within the CBD zoning district shall be discouraged.
E.   CBD central business district: To accommodate and encourage further
expansion and renewal in the historical core business area of the community. A
variety of business, public, quasi- public, cultural, residential and other
related uses are encouraged. The greatest possible concentration of retail
sales and business is to occur in this district. Pedestrian friendly uses and
developments are encouraged.
F.   M-1 light industrial district: To encourage the development of
manufacturing and wholesale business establishments which shall be free of
hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare,
are operated entirely within enclosed structures and generate little industrial
traffic. Research activities are encouraged and limited office and commercial
uses may be permitted as ancillary uses. This district is further designed to
act as a transitional use between heavy manufacturing uses and other less
intense businesses.
G.   BP business park district: To encourage the development of technical park/
research and development facilities, offices and office complexes, and limited
manufacturing activities including small scale production, distribution and
storage of goods. Support activities may also be permitted. All development
within this district shall be designed to be within a landscaped setting, and
be free of hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke
or glare. Such development shall be operated entirely within enclosed
structures, and generate minimal industrial traffic. All development requiring
a special use permit in the BP zoning district, as shown in section
17.14.010 of this title, shall occur under the PUD process in accordance with
section
17.40.010 et seq., of this title unless the proposed development does not meet
the area requirements. Development, in conjunction with adjacent parcels (to
meet the minimum area requirements), shall be encouraged. Otherwise a special
use permit shall be required unless the proposed use is shown as a permitted
use in the BP zoning district within section
17.14.010 of this title.
H.   M-2 heavy industrial district: To encourage the development of major
manufacturing, processing, warehousing and major research and testing
operations. Limited office and commercial uses may be permitted as ancillary
uses. These activities shall include certain uses excluded from the M-
1 district for reasons of health, safety or general welfare. All development
within this land use shall be reasonably free of hazardous or objectionable
elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare.
I.   PS public/semipublic: To provide for public/semipublic development such as
golf courses, parks, recreation facilities, greenways, schools, and public
service facilities such as government offices.
J.   MU mixed use district: To provide for a variety and mixture of uses such
as limited office, limited commercial, and residential. This district is
intended to ensure compatibility of new development with existing and future
development. It is also intended to ensure assemblage of properties in a
unified plan with coordinated and harmonious development which shall promote
outstanding design without unsightly and unsafe strip commercial development.
Uses should complement the uses allowed within the CBD zoning district. All
development requiring a special use permit in the MU zoning district, as shown
in section
17.14.010 of this title, shall occur under the PUD and/or development agreement
process in accordance with
 chapter 17.40 or 17.120 of this title unless the proposed development does not
meet the area requirements. In that case a cooperative development, in
conjunction with adjacent parcels (to meet the minimum area requirements),
shall be encouraged. Otherwise a special use permit shall be required unless
the proposed use is shown as a permitted use in the MU zoning district.
Residential densities shall not exceed twenty (20) dwelling units per gross
acre. When a property is being proposed for rezone to the MU zoning district a
development agreement may be utilized in lieu of the PUD and/or special use
process if approved by the council provided the development agreement includes
conditions of development that are required during the PUD and special use
process.
K.   P planned unit development: This designation, following any zoning
designation noted on the official zoning map of the city, indicates that the
development was approved by the city as a planned unit development. Density
transfers may have been permitted as a part of the overall development.

incorporated into this title as if set forth at length.
B.   Boundaries Of Districts: Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
boundaries of any of the zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map,
the following shall apply:
   1.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
centerline of street lines, highway right-of-way lines, streams, lakes or other
bodies of water, the centerline shall be construed to be such boundary;
   2.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries;
   3.   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the
official zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning map; and
   4.   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such boundary
shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of said railroad
line. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.10.040: SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT USE REGULATIONS:
District regulations shall be as set forth in the official schedule of district
regulations, in the performance standards in
chapter 17.18 of this title, and as otherwise provided within this Code. The
official schedule of district regulations is divided into five (5) land use
groups: agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial, and public/
semipublic. To determine in which district a specific use is allowed:
A.   Find the use in one of the land use groups;
B.   Read across the chart until either "P" or "S" appears in one of the
columns; and
C.   If "P" appears, the use is an allowed use; if "S" appears, the use is only
allowed upon the issuance of a special use permit and/or a development
agreement upon rezone to an MU or BP zoning designation; if no letter appears
the use is prohibited.
   Provided, however, that if a proposed use of property is not specifically
listed in the official schedule of district regulations, the use shall be
prohibited, unless the Administrator determines that the proposed use is
equivalent to a permitted or special use. In making said determination, the
Administrator shall consider the following:
   1.   The impacts on public services, and activities associated with the
proposed use, are substantially similar to any of the permitted or special uses
listed for the application district;
   2.   The proposed use shall not involve a higher level of activity or
density than any of the permitted or special uses listed for the applicable
district;
   3.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the district in
which the use is proposed to be located; and
   4.   The proposed use is in substantial conformance with goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
   5.   Should the use be determined to be equivalent to a use that requires a
special use permit, the application shall be required to follow the procedures
set forth for special use permits. (Ord. 1070, 2010: Ord. 1192, 2020)

section.
   3.   Waivers:
      a.   If the location of existing buildings or other structures prevents
conformance with the requirements of subsection B, of this section or its
implementation would create non-conformity of parking standards or other
special circumstances, the Planning and Zoning Administrator may grant a waiver
based on the following findings:
         (1)   That the requirements of subsection B. of this section are not
feasible due to existing development or circumstances regarding the property;
         (2)   That granting a waiver will not have a detrimental effect on
adjacent properties; and
         (3)   Granting a waiver will not be in conflict with past approvals
that required landscape improvements.

submitted at the time of application. Decisions of the Planning and Zoning
Administrator may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission within
sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the Administrator's written decision.
   4.   Alternative Compliance:
      a.   Purpose: To provide for alternative means to meet the intended
purposes of the landscape requirements when explicit compliance is not feasible
or the alternative means are superior to what is required.
      b.   Process:
         (1)   A request for alternative compliance shall be submitted as part
of the building permit or zoning application process. The request will be
considered by the same approval body as the base application. The request shall
specify:
            (A)   The specific requirements that are proposed to be modified;
            (B)   The reasons for the modification; and
            (C)   A demonstration of how the alternative means for compliance
meets the requirements' intended purpose.
         (2)   Stormwater Swales: Stormwater swales within front setbacks can
be approved as staff level provided that the landscape plans approved by the
applicable approval body are not changed substantially and comply with
subsection B. of this section. A landscape plan with swale construction details
which incorporate the landscape design shall be submitted for staff level
review.
      c.   Standards: The proposed alternative means for compliance with
specific requirements shall demonstrate the alternative compliance provides an
equal or superior means of meeting the intent and purpose of this section.
      d.   Required Findings: In order to grant approval for an application for
alternative compliance, the approving department shall determine the following:
         (1)   Strict adherence or application of the requirements is not
feasible because one of the following exist:
            (A)   Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are
such that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
            (B)   The site involves space limitations or an unusually shaped
lot;
            (C)   Safety consideration;
            (D)   Other regulatory agencies or departments having jurisdiction
are requiring design standards that conflict with the requirements of this
section;
            (E)   The proposed design includes innovative design features or
other site designs that promote walkability or mixed-use neighborhoods; or
            (F)   Environmental quality benefits;
         (2)   Alternative compliance provides an equal or superior means for
meeting the requirements; and
         (3)   Alternative compliance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or adversely affect the uses and character of surrounding properties.
   5.   Minimum Design Standards And Requirements:
      a.   Xeriscaping is encouraged.
      b.   Approved Plant Material: Plans should use plants that will thrive in
this environment. Guidance regarding certain species that are routinely
approved may be obtained from the Planning and Zoning Administrator and/or the
City Arborist.
      c.   Minimum Plant Sizes:
 
Evergreen trees        Four foot (4') height minimum
Shade/Ornamental trees One and half inch (1.5") caliper minimum
Perennials             One (1) gallon pot minimum
Woody shrubs           One (1) gallon pot minimum
 
      d.   Trees:
         (1)   Spacing: For design flexibility, trees may be grouped together
or spaced evenly as desired. The landscape plan shall show trees at mature size
on the drawings and spacing shall be no closer than 80 percent (80%) of the
average mature width of the trees.
         (2)   When five (5) or more trees are to be planted to meet the
requirements of any portion of this section, a mix of species shall be
provided. The number of species to be planted shall vary according to the
overall number of trees required to be planted according to the chart below:
 
No. of Trees  Minimum Number of Species
5-10         2
11-30        3
31-50        4
50+             5
 
      e.   Mulch: Mulch shall be used in all required planting areas. Approved
mulches may be organic, such as bark or they may include rock products, such as
"permabark" or similar products. Use of mulch, organic or rock, as the only
ground cover in required planting areas is prohibited. Pea gravel, drain rock
under one and a half inches, road base gravel, and similar products shall not
be used as mulch. All mulch shall be contained by a curb or other edging
material to contain the mulch and prevent it from moving to bordering surfaces.
Impermeable plastic weed barriers under the mulch is prohibited. Within
stormwater facilities, mulch may not float.
      f.   Curbing: All planting areas that border driveways, parking lots and
other vehicle use areas shall be protected by curbing, wheel stops or other
protective devices. Such devices shall be a minimum of thirty inches (30") from
tree trunks to prevent cars from damaging tree trunks.
      g.   Utilities: The following standards apply to the planting of trees
near existing utilities and to trenching for new utilities near existing trees:
         (1)   Overhead Utilities: For trees planted under or within ten (10)
lateral feet of any overhead utility wires, the landscape plan designer must
certify that the type of tree selected for that location will not grow to a
height so as to interfere with the overhead utility wires.
         (2)   Underground Utilities: All trees shall be planted outside of any
utility easement, unless written approval is obtained from the applicable
agency. All trees shall be planted outside of any easement that contains a city
sewer main, unless written approval is obtained from the City Engineer. If any
utility easement precludes trees required by this section, the width of the
required buffer shall be increased to accommodate the required trees.
         (3)   Trenching: New underground utilities shall be located outside of
the dripline of existing trees if trenched, or be tunneled a minimum of three
feet (3') below existing grade within the tree's dripline. Trenching within the
dripline of existing trees shall be done by hand, with care not to cut or
damage roots larger than two inches (2"). The guiding principle is that no root
two inches (2") or larger shall be cut. Note: This requirement is for placement
of new utilities and does not affect the city's or the utility's ability to
access existing utilities for repair, replacement and maintenance.
      h.   Berms: Berm slopes shall not exceed 3:1 (horizontal: vertical).
Slopes shall not exceed 4:1 on areas which require mowing.
      i.   Water Efficiency: The landscape plan shall provide for water
efficient landscaping as follows:
         (1)   Lawn Areas: Where appropriate and on sites where other landscape
options can be incorporated, large expanses of mown lawn are discouraged due to
its high water consumption. Lawn should not be treated as a fill-in material,
but rather as a functional or aesthetic element of the landscape. Mown lawn
should not be used in median strips, parking strips, or other difficult areas
to irrigate less than six feet (6') in width.
         (2)   Plant Selection And Location: Plants should be placed based on
adaptability to regional and micro climatic conditions. The use of native and
other low-water-use plants is encouraged. Plants having similar water needs
should be grouped together in distinct hydrazones, and spaced to minimize
watering needs while maximizing growth and spread of plants.
   6.   Irrigation:
      a.   Required: All landscape areas requiring irrigation shall be served
with an automatic underground irrigation system. Areas of landscaping which
will not require supplemental watering after initial establishment are not
required to have permanent irrigation.
      b.   Irrigation Water: Use of non-potable irrigation water is required
when determined to be available and adequate.
   7.   Perimeter Buffers
      a.   Street Buffers:
         (1)   Applicability: Landscape street buffers shall be required in all
multi-family residential, commercial and industrial zones. Street buffers shall
not be required in the Central Business District Zone in circumstances where a
landscape buffer would prevent the placement of a proposed building at the
allowed zero foot (0') front or street side setbacks.
         (2)   Size And Location: Landscape buffer widths along streets shall
be based on the required setbacks of the underlying zone. All required buffers
shall be maintained by the property owner.
         (3)   Street Trees: All required landscape street buffers shall be
planted with trees and shrubs, lawn or other vegetative groundcover, with a
minimum density of one (1) tree per forty lineal feet (40'). If this
calculation results in a fraction of one-half (.5) or greater, round up to an
additional tree. Clustering is allowed, however, trees shall be spaced no
closer than eighty percent (80%) of the average mature width of the trees.
         (4)   Conifers Along Streets: Coniferous trees are allowed along
streets only within planting areas 20 feet (20') or greater in width.
         (5)   Tree Wells: Tree wells shall be a minimum of nine (9) square
feet in size in the sidewalk area. Root barriers are encouraged.
      b.   Side And Rear Perimeter Buffers:
         (1)   Applicability: Side and rear landscape buffers shall be required
for all multi-family residential, commercial and industrial developments.
         (2)   Size And Location: Landscape buffer widths shall be based on the
required setbacks of the underlying zone. All required side and rear buffers
shall be located within the property and shall be maintained by the property
owner.
         (3)   Parking Lot/Vehicular Use Area Buffers: If an interior side or
rear lot line is adjacent to a parking lot or other vehicular use area, such
as, but not limited to, vehicle sales areas, truck and bus parking areas and
driveways, the following standards shall apply:
            (A)   Landscaping: The perimeter landscape strip shall be planted
with one (1) tree per 40 lineal feet (40'). If this calculation results in a
fraction of one-half (.5) or greater, round up to an additional tree.
Clustering is allowed, however, trees shall be spaced no closer than 80 percent
(80%) of the average mature width of the trees.
            (B)   Exceptions: Where two (2) properties have a shared access and
parking agreement that has been approved by the city, the above requirements
may be waived.
      c.   Buffers Between Different Land Uses:
         (1)   Applicability: Land use buffers shall be required along
contiguous property lines between residential uses and dissimilar uses such as
industrial and commercial. The buffers are required along the entire contiguous
property line. This section shall not apply to mixed use projects on contiguous
properties.
         (2)   Size: The minimum buffer width between land uses is based on the
required setbacks of the underlying zone.
         (3)   Buffer Materials: The materials within the required buffer
between incompatible land uses are regulated as follows:
            (A)   Mix Of Materials: All buffer areas shall be comprised of, but
not limited to, a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, lawn, or other
vegetative groundcover. A minimum of six foot (6') fences, walls and berms may
also be incorporated into the buffer area.
            (B)   Buffer Walls: Where existing or proposed adjacent land uses
cannot be adequately buffered with plant materials, the city may require
inclusion of a wall, fence, or other type of screen that mitigates noise and/or
unsightly uses. If a wall or fence six feet (6') tall is provided, the planting
requirement may be reduced to at least one (1) tree per forty lineal feet
(40'), plus shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative groundcover, in lieu of the
requirements of this section. Clustering is allowed, however, trees shall be
spaced no closer than 80 percent (80%) of the average mature width of the
trees.
            (C)   Chain-link Fencing: Chain-link fencing does not qualify as a
screening material; therefore the buffer must still be landscaped, even if a
chain link fence is provided.
            (D)   Pedestrian Access: Landscaping and screens shall not
eliminate pedestrian access between commercial and residential districts.
   8.   Interior Parking Lot:
      a.   Applicability: Interior parking lot landscaping shall be required in
any parking lot with twenty (20) spaces or more, including vehicle sales lots.
      b.   Planter Size: Landscape planters shall be a minimum of eight feet
(8') in width for trees. Required parking lot planters shall be the length of
the adjacent parking space. Dimensions are measured inside curbs.
      c.   Parking Lot Layout: No linear grouping of parking spaces shall
exceed twenty (20) in a row, without an internal planter island. Interior
landscaping shall be used to delineate and guide major traffic movement within
the parking area. Terminal planters shall be provided at the ends of rows of
parking to protect parked vehicles and confine moving traffic to aisles and
driveways. Interior landscape planters shall be spaced as evenly as feasible to
reduce the visual impact of long rows of parked cars.
      d.   Trees Required: Each interior planter that serves a single row of
parking spaces shall be landscaped with at least one (1) tree and shall be
covered with low shrubs or other vegetative groundcover. Each interior planter
that serves a double row of parking spaces shall have at least two (2) trees
and shall be covered with low shrubs or other vegetative groundcover. Deciduous
shade trees must be pruned to a minimum height of eight feet (8') above the
adjacent parking areas. Evergreen trees are prohibited in interior planters.
      e.   Industrial Exclusion: Industrial parking, storage, and loading areas
are specifically excluded from the interior landscape requirements, but shall
meet all perimeter and right-of-way landscape and screening requirements.
      f.   Snow removal and storage shall be accommodated when developing a
landscape plan to minimize damage to plants and to compliment the stormwater
management design.
C.   Landscape Approval: Before issuance of the final certificate of occupancy,
the Building Official along with the Administrator or their respective
designees, shall certify the landscape is what was approved.
D.   Extension Of Time For Installation:
   1.   Upon recommendation of the Administrator, a temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed one hundred
eighty (180) days when:
      a.   Due to weather or other circumstances, the landscaping or other
required site amenities cannot be completed; and
      b.   The applicant has provided a surety to the city for the required
improvements.
E.   Landscape Maintenance:
   1.   Applicability: The requirement for landscape maintenance applies in all
zones where landscaping has been required.
   2.   Standards:
      a.   The property owner, occupant, user or person in charge or control of
any property shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping and
screening devices required by this section.
      b.   Topping any street tree required by this section is prohibited. For
trees not within street right-of-way, alternative pruning techniques to achieve
specific horticultural or aesthetic effects may be used if approved by the City
Arborist. Examples include pleached allee, pleached bosque, espalier, and
pollarded canopy.
      c.   Tree grates shall be widened to accommodate the growing tree trunk
and prevent girdling of any tree planted in tree wells within sidewalks or
other public right-of-way.
      d.   Plant materials that exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease, and/
or damage shall be appropriately treated to correct the problem. Dead plant
materials shall be replaced within thirty (30) calendar days of notification
from the city.
      e.   All landscaping required by this subsection may be subject to
periodic inspections by city officials to determine compliance or to
investigate.
      f.   Violations of this section shall be subject to Chapter 8.08 Nuisance
of the City of Jerome Municipal Code. (Ord. 1191, 2020)

17.22.010: PURPOSE:
A.   To accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while
protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community,
regulations regarding personal wireless facilities, spires, poles, antennas,
steeples, towers, and other such structures are necessary in order to:
   1.   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to the
residents and businesses of the city;
   2.   Minimize adverse visual effects of spires, poles, antennas, steeples,
towers, and other such structures through careful design and siting standards;
   3.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from spire, pole,
antenna, steeple, tower, and other such structures' failure, through structural
standards and setback requirements; and
   4.   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.22.020: TOWERS IN ZONING DISTRICTS:
A.   Residential (R) Districts:
   1.   On residentially zoned parcels, towers supporting amateur radio
antennas shall not be permitted in the front, side or street side yard.
   2.   Personal wireless facilities shall be prohibited in all residential (R)
zones.
B.   PS (Public/Semipublic) District:
   1.   Wireless antennas may be permitted to be attached to existing light
standards and power line support devices (or replacement equivalent of same
height) provided, however, the antenna(s) are either flush mounted or mounted
in a manner that provide minimum visual impact. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all provisions of this subsection shall be applicable to wireless antennas
located on existing light standards and power line support devices. (Ord. 1070,
2010)
17.22.030: COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
A.   A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service tower
in excess of thirty five feet (35') in height shall not be approved unless the
commission finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed
tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building
within the following radius of the proposed tower:
   1.   A two (2) mile radius for towers with a height over one hundred ten
feet (110').
   2.   A one mile radius for towers with a height over eighty feet (80') but
not more than one hundred ten feet (110').
   3.   A one-half (1/2) mile radius for towers with a height over fifty feet
(50') but not more than eighty feet (80').
   4.   A one-fourth (1/4) mile radius for towers with a height over thirty
five feet (35') but not more than fifty feet (50').
B.   It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed
tower or antenna cannot be accommodated on an approved tower or building within
the required search radius due to one or more of the following reasons:
   1.   Unwillingness of another tower or facility owner to entertain shared
use.
   2.   The proposed collocation of an existing tower or facility would be in
violation of any local, state or federal law.
   3.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
   4.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the
usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
   5.   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius
cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
   6.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate the planned
telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, or other
professional qualified to provide necessary documentation.
C.   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall be
designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both
the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2)
additional users if the tower is over one hundred ten feet (110') in height,
for at least one additional user if the tower is over fifty feet (50') in
height.
D.   Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon
the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
E.   Personal wireless facilities proposed at a location which has an approved
special use permit (approved after the effective date hereof) for an existing
facility which was required to allow collocation shall not be required to
obtain a separate special use permit as long as all the requirements of the
previously approved special use permit will be complied with. Design review,

accessory utility buildings, are permitted in the fall zone, except as may be
specifically permitted by the commission through a special use process.
C.   Towers shall be set back from all existing public right of way lines (or
planned right of way lines if additional height is to be acquired in the
future) by a minimum distance equal to twice the height of the tower including
all antennas and attachments. If this requirement conflicts with other setback
requirements of this code the setback with the greater distance shall prevail,
except as may be allowed in subsection E of this section.
D.   Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a public
street.
E.   A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a public
street varied, at the sole discretion of the commission, to allow the
integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church
steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure. (Ord.
1070, 2010)
17.22.060: TOWER LIGHTING, SIGNAGE, AND ATTACHMENTS:

17.22.095: PRIORITIES:
A.   Priority Of Location: The following establishes the order of priorities
for locating new communications facilities:
   1.   Place antennas and towers in districts zoned light industrial (M-1).
   2.   Place antennas and towers in districts zoned central business district
(CBD) which do not adjoin or adversely impact residential neighborhoods.
   3.   Place antennas on appropriate existing structures, such as buildings,
communications towers, water towers, and smokestacks in other zoned districts.
   4.   Place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property.
   5.   Place antennas and towers in residential districts only if locations
for which a need has been demonstrated are not available on existing structures
or in nonresidential districts.
   6.   Place antennas and towers on public property.
An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a residential
zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to
locate the proposed communications facilities on a government structure, a
private institutional structure, or other appropriate existing structures
within a nonresidential zoning district, and that due to valid considerations
including physical constraints, and economic or technological feasibility, no
appropriate location is available. The telecommunications company is required
to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a one
mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to install the antenna
on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. The
information submitted by the applicant shall include a map of the area to be
served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna sites in the applicant's
network, and an evaluation of existing buildings taller than twenty feet (20'),
communications towers and water tanks within one mile of the proposed tower.
B.   Priority Of Users: Priority for the use of city owned land for antennas
and towers will be given to the following entities in descending order:
   1.   City of Jerome;
   2.   Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and ambulance
services, which are not part of the city and private entities with a public
safety agreement with the city;
   3.   Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to public
safety; and
   4.   Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication
services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized
mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging, and
similar services that are marketed to the general public.
C.   Minimum Requirements: The placement of antennas or towers on city owned
property must comply with the following requirements:
   1.   The antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which the
city owned property is intended;
   2.   The antennas or tower will have no adverse impact on surrounding
private property;
   3.   The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and
commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use
of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The fees shall be
established by the council after considering comparable rates in other cities,
potential expenses, risks to the city, and other appropriate factors;
   4.   The applicant will submit a letter of credit, performance bond, or
other security acceptable to the city to cover the costs of antenna or tower's
removal;
   5.   The antennas or tower will not interfere with other users who have a
higher priority as discussed in subsection B of this section;
   6.   Upon reasonable notice, the antennas or tower may be required to be
removed at the user's expense;
   7.   The applicant must reimburse the city for any costs which it incurs
because of the presence of the applicant's antennas or tower;
   8.   The user must obtain all necessary land use approvals; and
   9.   The applicant will cooperate with the city's objective to promote
collocations and thus limit the number of separate antenna sites requested.
D.   Special Requirements: The use of certain city owned property, such as
water tower sites, for antennas or towers brings with it special concerns due
to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of antennas or towers on
these special city owned sites will be allowed only when the following
additional requirements are met:
   1.   Water Tower Or Reservoir Sites: The city's water towers and reservoirs
represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak
capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of the city's water supply is of
prime importance to the city. As access to the city's water storage systems
increases, so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water
supply. For these reasons, the placement of antennas or towers on water tower
or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that
the following requirements are met:
      a.   The applicant's access to the facility will not increase the risks
of contamination to the city's water supply;
      b.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds to
accommodate the applicant's facility;
      c.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the city; and
      d.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of
workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
E.   Application Process: All applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower
on city owned property must submit to the administrator a completed application
and detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of this
chapter, this title, and other provisions of this code, along with other
pertinent information requested by the city.
F.   Termination: The council may cancel any lease if it determines that any
one of the following conditions exist:
   1.   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use;
   2.   A user's frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users
of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or
   3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the city's lease or other authorization.
Before acting, the city will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for the user to
address the council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergencies.
G.   Reservation Of Right: Notwithstanding the above, the council reserves the
right to deny, for any reason, the use of any or all city owned property by any
one or all applicants. (Ord. 1070, 2010)

administered by the federal aviation administration.
   5.   Written approval of the site location with specific reference to the
height of the antenna structure and any lighting issues, from the federal
aviation administration, the chief of the Idaho bureau of aeronautics, and the
Boise airport commission and an aviation easement approved by the Boise airport
commission.
   6.   Propagation charts showing existing and proposed transmission coverage
at the subject site and within an area large enough to provide an understanding
of why the facility needs to be in the chosen location.
   7.   A written analysis demonstrating that the proposed site is the most

17.30.010: INTENT:
It is the intent of this chapter to permit nonconforming uses to continue until

for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.30.020: AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING USE:
If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date hereof that would not be allowed in
the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A.   Additions Or Alterations: No existing structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this title in the district in which it is located shall be
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located.
B.   Expansion: No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any additional
land area.
C.   Change Of Nonconforming Use: If no structural alterations are made, any
nonconforming use of a structure and land may, upon the issuance of a special
use permit by the council, be changed to another nonconforming use; provided,
that the council shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the council may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with other provisions of this title.
D.   Change To Conforming Use: Any structure, or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted
use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the

thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.

applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the
structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. This section

exists or as it may hereafter be amended. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.30.030: EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING USE:
Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming use shall
not be extended or enlarged after the effective date hereof by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally
prohibited in the district in which such use is located. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.30.040: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or

restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.30.050: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
A.   Single Nonconforming Lots Of Record: In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date hereof, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
title. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership (see subsection B of this section). This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district;
provided, that hard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.

combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the effective date hereof, and if all or part of the
lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this title and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold
in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this title, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this title.
(Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.30.060: BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION:
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a

Plan
17.40.010: PURPOSE:
It shall be the policy to guide a major development of land and construction by
encouraging planned unit development (PUD) to achieve the following:
A.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing
and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a reduction
in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
B.   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if permitted
as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses, industrial uses and services;
C.   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and
geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents the
disruption of natural drainage patterns;
D.   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets; and
E.   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation and
community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.020: EFFECT OF OTHER ZONING PROVISIONS:
A.   Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of the other chapters of this title, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed
by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this title.
B.   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, planned unit developments
shall also be subject to the requirements set forth in section
16.34.010 of this code and other provisions of title 16 of this code related to
subdivisions. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.030: OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS:
A.   An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property owner or a
person having an existing interest in the property to be included in the PUD.
The PUD application shall be filed in the name or names of the recorded owner
or owners of property included in the development. However, the application may
be filed by the holder(s) of an equitable interest in such property.
B.   Before approval is granted to the final development plan, the entire
project shall be under single ownership or control and legal title must be
presented with the final development plan. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.040: USES PERMITTED:
All uses that may be allowed within the zoning district are permitted within a
PUD. Also, up to ten percent (10%) of the gross land area may be directed to
other commercial, industrial, public and quasi-public uses that are not allowed
within the zoning district; provided, that there is a favorable finding by the
council:
A.   That the uses are appropriate with the residential uses;
B.   That the uses are intended to serve principally the residents of the PUD;
C.   That the uses are planned as an integral part of the PUD;
D.   That the uses be located and so designed as to provide direct access to a
collector or an arterial street without creating congestion or traffic hazards;
and
E.   That a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the residential development
occurs prior to the development of the related commercial or industrial land
uses. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.050: MINIMUM AREA:
A PUD for the following principal uses shall contain an area of not less than:
A.   Three (3) acres for residential development; or
B.   Five (5) acres for residential use with subordinate commercial or
industrial uses; or
C.   Ten (10) acres for commercial use; or
D.   Ten (10) acres for industrial use. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.060: COMMON OPEN SPACE:
A.   Required Common Open Space: A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross
land area developed in any residential PUD project shall be reserved for common
open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area
being developed.
B.   Dedication Of Land For Public Use: A required amount of common open space
land reserved under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners
of the project area for the use of each owner who buys property within the
development or be dedicated to the public and retained as common open space for
parks, recreation and related uses. Public utility and similar easements and
right of way for watercourses and other similar channels are not acceptable for
common open space dedication unless such land or right of way is usable as a
trail or other similar purpose and approved by the council.
C.   Maintenance: The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces
shall be specified by the developer before approval of the final development
plan.
D.   Clustering: Every property developed under the PUD approach should be
designed to abut upon common open space or similar areas. A clustering of
dwellings is encouraged. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.070: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are required
within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances to these systems which can be
effectively screened may be exempted from this requirement if the commission
finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed PUD. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.080: INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY:
To provide for an incentive for quality PUD, the council may authorize an
increased residential density of up to fifteen percent (15%) of the allowable
number of dwelling units. Character, identity and architectural and siting
variation incorporated in a development shall be considered cause for density
increases, provided these factors make up a substantial contribution to the
objectives of the PUD, which are as follows:
A.   Landscaping (a maximum increase of 5 percent). Streetscape, open spaces
and plazas, use of existing landscaping, pedestrianway treatment and
recreational areas;
B.   Siting (a maximum increase of 5 percent). Visual focal points, use of
existing physical features such as topography, view, sun and wind orientation,
circulation pattern, physical environment, variation in building setbacks and
building grouping (such as clustering); and
C.   Design features (a maximum increase of 5 percent). Street sections,
architectural styles, harmonious use of materials, parking areas broken by
landscaping features and varied use of housing types.
D.   The fifteen percent (15%) density bonus shall not apply to the housing for
"older persons" portion of a PUD which qualifies for the density bonus provided
for in section
17.40.090 of this chapter. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.090: INCREASED DENSITY FOR COMMUNITIES FOR OLDER PERSONS:
A.   To provide an incentive for communities for "older persons" (55 and over,
as defined by the federal fair housing act of 1999, or any subsequent revision
thereof) to be included within lower density residential PUDs the council may
authorize an increased residential density to allow a maximum of three (3)
dwelling units per gross acre within any zoning district which limits density
to less than three (3) dwelling units per gross acre specifically and solely
for any portion of a PUD planned for a community for "older persons".
B.   Character, identity, landscaping and architectural/siting variation are to
be incorporated into any community for "older persons". The community may
consist of single-family, two-family or multi-family dwelling units, or a
mixture thereof, and should be clustered and include amenities for "older
persons". Zero lot line development with common open space areas shall be the
only type of development permitted to be considered for such an increase. The
zero lot line development shall allow for minimal front and/or rear yard areas
for each residential unit if proposed by the developer and approved by the
city. However, the exterior side walls of all residential buildings shall abut
a common area lot line. The intent of the zero lot line development is to allow
for large areas of open space as opposed to a sea of side yard and rear yard
fences dividing residential lots. For purposes of this section the minimum lot
size referenced elsewhere within this code shall be calculated by considering
the entire community for "older persons" as a whole. Also, the PUD shall be
designed so the community for "older persons" portion of the development does
not abut residential parcels adjacent to the PUD and sufficient buffering be
provided as may be required by the city.
C.   The following site criteria must be met in order to consider approval of
the density increase for the community for "older persons":
   1.   The land area for the community for "older persons" shall not encompass
a land area exceeding sixteen percent (16%) of the total land area within the
entire planned unit development;
   2.   The total land area of the entire planned unit development shall be a
minimum of eighty (80) acres;
   3.   The entire PUD shall be served by either a municipal or community water
and sewer system;
   4.   Any limitations regarding individuals occupying the community for
"older persons" must be in accordance with local, state and federal
regulations, and must specifically be in accordance with the federal fair
housing act as revised in 1999, or any subsequent revision thereof. "Older
persons" shall be as defined within the aforementioned act;
   5.   The community for "older persons" shall be prohibited within any 100-
year floodplain.
   6.   Open space requirements shall be as follows:
      a.   If the residential lots (not including the community for "older
persons" portion of the PUD) meet the minimum lot size requirement or are
reduced below the minimum lot size requirements such that no residential lot is
less than the prescribed size the entire PUD shall consist of a minimum of
twenty percent (20%) of open space.
      b.   If the residential lots (not including the community for "older
persons" portion of the PUD) are reduced below the minimum lot size requirement
such that any residential lot is less than one acre in size the entire PUD
shall consist of a minimum of twenty six percent (26%) of open space.
      c.   Pathways, buffer areas, public park sites, public school sites, and
public golf courses and/or driving ranges proposed within any such PUD shall be
included, in their entirety, with any other open space areas proposed when
calculating the minimum open space required.
      d.   A minimum of one 5,000-square foot clubhouse/indoor recreation
facility shall be provided within the community for "older persons" portion of
the PUD.
   7.   The final plat shall include a note indicating that the portion of land
permitted for the density bonus for "older persons" shall be for "older
persons" as defined by the federal fair housing act as revised in 1999, or any
subsequent revision thereof. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.100: ARRANGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL USES:
A.   When PUDs include commercial uses, commercial buildings and establishments
shall be planned as groups having common parking areas and common ingress and
egress points in order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at
intersections. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of
the commercial areas abutting residential areas.
B.   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious
design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for
internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and
facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas.
C.   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.110: ARRANGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL USES:
A.   PUDs may include industrial uses if it can be shown that the development
results in a more efficient and desirable use of land.
B.   Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in parklike surroundings
utilizing landscaping as buffers to screen lighting, parking areas, loading
areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw materials or products. A planned
industrial area shall provide for the harmony of buildings and a compact
grouping in order to economize in the provision of such utility services as are
required. Thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum throughout a planned
industrial area in order to reduce through traffic.
C.   Project side yards of forty feet (40') and a rear yard of fifty feet (50')
shall be required if the project is located adjacent to any residential uses.
All intervening spaces between the right of way line and project building line

appropriate. The developer may also meet with the commission or council prior
to submitting an application. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.140: PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
A.   Application For Preliminary PUD: An application for preliminary PUD shall

days after the public hearing, the commission shall review the preliminary
development plan to determine if it is consistent with the intent and purpose
of this title; whether the proposed development advances the general welfare of
the community and neighborhood and whether the benefits, combination of various
land uses and the interrelationship with the land uses in the surrounding area
justify the deviation from standard district regulations and its recommendation
to the council. The commission's recommendation in principle of the preliminary
development plan shall be necessary before an applicant may submit a final
development plan. Approval in principle shall not be construed to endorse a
precise location of uses, configuration of parcels or engineering feasibility.

and presented to them establish that:
   1.   The proposed development can be initiated within one year of the date
of approval;
   2.   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance

will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will
have a beneficial effect which would not be achieved under standard district
regulations;
   3.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PUD;

B.   If the application is either approved or approved with conditions, the
council shall direct the administrator to issue zoning permits only in
accordance with the approved final development plan and the supplementary
conditions attached thereto. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.40.180: EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL PERIOD FOR FINAL DEVELOPMENT
PLAN:
The approval of a final development plan for a PUD shall be for a period not to
exceed one year to allow for preparation and recording of the required
subdivision plan and the development of the project. If no construction has
begun within one year after approval is granted, the approved final development
plan shall be void. An extension of the time limit or modification of the
approved final development plan may be approved if the council finds that such
extension or modification is not in conflict with the public interest. (Ord.

17.60.060 of this chapter for the zoning district involved;
B.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives or
with any specific objective of the comprehensive plan and/or this title;
C.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area;
D.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
E.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such
as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse
disposal, water and sewer and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;

conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors;

scale developments, the council may require sufficient park or open space
facilities of acceptable size, location and site characteristics that may be
suitable for the proposed development. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.60.050: SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS:
In granting any special use, the council may prescribe appropriate conditions,
bonds and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violations of such

of city impact by the city and county of Jerome from time to time in accordance
with the provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6526.
B.   In case a property under single ownership is divided by the boundary line
of the Jerome area of city impact, if such line divides such property so that
one or both of the parts has a depth of three hundred feet (300') or less, such
part may be included in the jurisdiction within which the remainder and larger
portion of the property is located. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.110.020: JEROME AREA OF CITY IMPACT MAP:
The map designated as the official area of impact map for the city, within the
meaning of Idaho Code section 67-6526, is available for inspection in the
office of the city clerk. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.110.030: GENERAL:
The establishment and modification of the area of city impact is authorized by
Idaho Code section 67-6526. The purpose of this section (the city/county
agreement) is to proactively plan for orderly and consistent development where
annexation is anticipated to occur for the next ten (10) years by providing
standards for development for the growth within the areas of city impact; to
promote the public health, safety, and the general welfare of the citizens of
Jerome County; to ensure protection for municipalities and landowners against
adjacent, incompatible development by establishing zoning districts; and to
organize and manage growth by establishing land use regulations for those
zones.
A.   Boundaries:
   1.   Pursuant to the above referenced statement of purpose, areas of city
impact are the areas designated on the Jerome County zoning map, and as further
described in the legal description attached thereto, hereby fully incorporated
by reference, copies of which are available for inspection at the office of the
clerk of the city of Jerome, Jerome County recorder's office and the Jerome
County planning and zoning office.
   2.   Any hearing or other action by the city which causes a change in city
limits, shall stand as the basis for Exhibits “A” and “B”; as well as the
County’s Zoning Map, being amended in conformance therewith. No other county
action, by way of hearings or otherwise, shall be required for the
incorporation of such amendments.
   3.   In circumstances where a property under single ownership is divided by
the boundary line of an area of city impact the property shall recognize the
respective zones that are designated on the official zoning map. If the
property is divided along the area of city impact boundary line, resulting in
one parcel lying in the area of city impact and the other not, then each parcel
will become an original parcel. (See JCZO chapter 14.)
B.   Establishment, Review And Amendment:
   1.   Jerome County shall work cooperatively with each of its municipalities
to develop and review the county's comprehensive plan and corresponding
ordinances for areas of city impact.
   2.   Governing boards shall undertake a review of agreements, ordinances,
and comprehensive plan policies regarding areas of city impact at least every
ten (10) years, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-6526(e).
   3.   Negotiation for amendments to this section shall follow procedures
outlined in state code as well as amendment provisions for each entity's
specific document or ordinance.
C.   Applicability Of JCZO:
   1.   The Jerome County zoning ordinance (JCZO) shall govern over those
matters within areas of city impact that are not specifically covered by this
section. In the event of conflict between this section and the JCZO, the
language of this section shall control. Specifically, the application, notice
and hearing procedures of the JCZO, shall control specific permits (i.e.,
special use or land division permit).
   2.   Notification of public hearings and land divisions within the area of
city impact zone shall be sent to the city for review and comment. For
consideration in the review process, the city shall reply no later than seven
(7) days prior to the hearing.
   3.   If a recommendation is received from the city, it shall be given great
weight by the county, provided it is legally and factually supported, however
such recommendation shall in no way obligate the county.
   4.   If no response is received, the county may proceed without a
recommendation from the city.
   5.   The county shall notify the city of its final decision in the matter by
forwarding a copy of all final documents reflecting the action taken by the
county.
D.   Annexation: Annexation by the city shall be limited to those lands lying
within areas of city impact and shall be contiguous to the boundaries of the
city. Properties not within areas of city impact that are contiguous to the
boundary of the city shall be allowed annexation when requested by an owner, as
provided for in Idaho Code section 50-222.
   1.   Prior to annexation of land into the city, the county and city shall
meet and jointly determine the renaming and/or readdressing of any previously
named county road. Every attempt to maintain consistency, limit potential
confusion, and assist emergency services in providing directions to first
responders shall be made by extending the altered name and/or addressing
sequence to the nearest intersection or most logical point of termination
whenever possible. The county shall continue to be the addressing authority for
all properties within its jurisdiction.
   2.   Upon annexation, the provisions of the JCZO shall no longer apply to
the annexed area. The city shall notify the board of county commissioners and
the Jerome County planning and zoning office when annexation is being
considered and when annexations are completed.
E.   Infrastructure: The city shall notify the county prior to placing any city
infrastructure outside of the city's limits and within the county's
jurisdiction.
F.   Zoning Districts Within The Area Of City Impact:
   1.   Airport Overlay Zone (ARO): An airport overlay zone (ARO) applies to
those areas surrounding public/commercial airports. The purpose of this zone is
to prevent the creation of aviation hazards, which endanger the health, safety,
and welfare of the public, as well as users of the airport. The airport overlay
zone is established to protect airport airspace and prevent the encroachment of
noise sensitive or incompatible land uses within certain areas of the airport.
All land within both the ARO and areas of city impact, shall be subject to the
provisions of this section and specifically, chapter 12 of the JCZO.
   2.   Agriculture Limited Zone (IMP-A-L): The agriculture limited zone is
intended to encourage agricultural uses and those activities that support
agriculture while limiting livestock confinement operations. This zoning
designation will also prevent premature conversion of rural land for
nonagricultural development by limiting residential density.
   3.   Residential (IMP-RES): The residential district is intended to provide
and promote residential density of one acre or less, to minimize potential
water, sewer, and access problems common to scattered rural residential
development, and to assure that the layout of any such developments will be
compatible with city standards when eventually annexed.
   4.   Commercial (IMP-COM): The commercial district is designed to
accommodate and promote business developments which may differ in size and use;
to encourage the grouping together of businesses, both public and semipublic
that are capable of being operated under such standards as they will be
unobtrusive and not detrimental to surrounding uses. Uses permitted in this
zone are those which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or objectionable
elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare. No new residential housing
would be permitted within this zone. The property along state and federal
highways will be developed with strict sign standards, landscaping design,
lighting and parking standards to enhance highway corridors and entrances into
the community.
   5.   Industrial (IMP-IND): The industrial district is designed to provide
for convenient employment centers of light manufacturing, research and
development, warehousing, and distributing. This district is intended to
encourage the development of industrial uses that are clean, quiet, entirely or
almost entirely, within enclosed structures. Accessibility to transportation
systems is a requirement of this district. No new residential housing would be
permitted within this zone.
G.   Additional Standards Within Zones: In addition to the customary standards
found in the JCZO, the following regulations shall apply within areas of city
impact:
   1.   Roads:
      a.   The appropriate highway district will determine infrastructure
requirements for access control, public streets and roads.
      b.   The city may recommend additional requirements for private roads,
which the board may impose as a condition of the permit.
   2.   Building/Fire Codes:
      a.   The appropriate fire district shall determine fire requirements
within areas of city impact, including, but not limited to, requiring fire
hydrants.
   3.   Agricultural Limited (IMP-A-L):
      a.   Residential density shall not exceed one dwelling per parcel.
      b.   Residential housing that is to be developed shall connect to
municipal sewer and water systems if the property line is within three hundred
feet (300') of the systems and if the system is accessible for connection. If
sewer and water connection is not available or beyond three hundred feet (300')
from the property line, septic and wells shall be allowed according to state
regulations.
      c.   Parcels shall be allowed one regulated land division with proper
application and permit as outlined in chapter 14 of the JCZO. Only one of the
resulting parcels therefrom shall have a single residence or residential
building right. The other resulting parcel shall be deemed unbuildable for
residential purposes and shall have such "unbuildable" status noted on the
recorded land division survey and deed.
      d.   Animal unit density shall not exceed two (2) animal units per acre.
An animal unit is defined in chapter 2 of the JCZO.
   4.   Residential (IMP-RES):
      a.   Residential density may be greater than one dwelling per one acre if
each home will be connected to a municipal or community sewer and water system.
Land divisions of less than twenty (20) acres shall not be allowed without
connecting into a municipal or community sewer and water system. Land division
density shall be one home per twenty (20) acres.
      b.   Residential housing that is to be developed shall connect to
municipal sewer and water systems if the property line is within three hundred
feet (300') of the systems and if the system is accessible for connection. If
sewer and water connection is not available or is beyond three hundred feet
(300') from the property line, septic and wells shall be allowed according to
state regulations.
      c.   Manufactured and mobile homes are permitted within this zone as long
as they meet the adopted local and state codes. There is no age limitation on
such homes.
   5.   Commercial (IMP-COM):
      a.   All commercial developments that require city sewer and water
services shall participate in a predevelopment meeting with Jerome County,
Jerome city and affected agencies before obtaining a building permit for the
construction of the development.
      b.   The city shall provide written approval to the county for all sewer
and water hookups before a certificate of occupancy shall be issued to the
developer.
      c.   Commercial development situated on state or federal highways shall
be landscaped along the highway corridor. Lighting shall be shielded or
directional and shall not trespass property lines of the developing lot or
parcel. All vehicles shall be parked to the side or rear of any buildings with
no parking between the highway and any building fronting the highway, unless a
landscaped berm screens parking from the view of the highway. Proposed
commercial developments shall be required to submit landscaping plans, a
lighting diagram, parking diagram and a setback approval correspondence from
the Idaho transportation department as part of any building or development
application.
   6.   Industrial (IMP-IND):
      a.   No new residential housing would be permitted within this zone.
      b.   All industrial developments that require city sewer and water
services shall participate in a predevelopment meeting with Jerome County,
Jerome city and affected agencies before obtaining a building permit for the
construction of the development.
      c.   The city shall provide written approval to the county for all sewer
and water hookups before a certificate of occupancy shall be issued to the
developer.
   7.   Setbacks shall be required in the area of impacts zones as indicated on
the following table:
 
Zoning District Front Setback Rear Setback Side Setback Street Side
IMP-RES         25'           20'          10'          15'

JCZO, the regulations of this section shall also apply to all commercial and
residential subdivisions within areas of city impact.
   1.   Streets/Roads:
      a.   All public streets/roads shall be under the jurisdiction of the
appropriate highway district. All roads and streets shall be constructed to the
minimum standards of that highway district unless the standards of the city are
more stringent, then the developer will adhere to the city's standards.
      b.   All private street/roads that will not become public streets/roads
shall meet the city's standards.
   2.   Curb, Gutter, And Stormwater:
      a.   Lots one acre and over shall not be required to provide curb,

appropriate fire district.
      b.   Fire flow information shall be provided to the appropriate fire
district when public/municipal water systems are utilized for fire hydrants, as
well as when commercial or residential uses require interior sprinklers for
fire suppression.
   5.   Water:
      a.   If the city water connection is within three hundred feet (300') of
the property line and accessible, the developer shall connect to the system.
      b.   If the city water connection is beyond three hundred feet (300')
from the property line the developer shall either connect the development to
the water system for the city or provide a community water system that may be
easily connected to the water system for the city as it becomes available.

I.   Regulations Within Zones:
   1.   Applicability: Unless otherwise stated, the following regulations shall
apply only to the primary land use of a property.
   2.   Explanation Of Land Use Charts: To determine where a specific use is
permitted, it is necessary to find the specific use in the charts below. Uses
are listed in the horizontal rows, zones are shown in the vertical columns, and
the key letters indicating the degree of permission of a use are found at the
intersection of the appropriate row and column.
      a.   The letter "P" indicates that a specific use is permitted in a
specific zone.
      b.   The letter "S" indicates that a special use permit is required for
that particular use to be compatible to the standard and customary uses in that
particular zone.
      c.   An empty square indicates that such use is not expected to occur in
such zone; therefore it is prohibited at the time of the adoption of the JCZO.
      d.   The letters "NR" indicate that there is no requirement established
for a particular use in a particular zone.
When several uses are combined and made part of a larger, all encompassing land
use, the most restrictive chart designation shall control for purposes of
determining the appropriate zone and required application.
   3.   Land Uses Unidentified In The Charts: Any land use not identified in
the charts of this section shall require a negotiation and agreement between
the city and the county followed by an amendment of this section; and shall
only proceed thereafter in accordance with the amendment. The amended ordinance
shall mandate whether the proposed use in the various zones is: allowed free of
restrictions; permitted; permitted with conditions; or prohibited. The process
for amendment shall adhere to the procedures outlined in subsection B of this
section.
   4.   Zoning Standards For Permitted Land Uses: Zoning regulations may have
been established for permitted or allowable uses by performance standards in
chapter 6 of the JCZO, and other chapters thereof when appropriate.

CHAPTER 17.120

SECTION:
17.120.010: Purpose
17.120.020: Initiation Of Development Agreement
17.120.030: Form Of Development Agreement
17.120.040: Approval Of The Development Agreement
17.120.050: Recordation Of Development Agreement
17.120.060: Duty To Comply With Development Agreement
17.120.070: Modification Of Development Agreement
17.120.080: Termination Of Development Agreement
17.120.090: Enforcement Of Development Agreements
17.120.010: PURPOSE:
Development agreements are a discretionary tool to be used by the council as a
condition of rezoning. Development agreements allow a specific project with a
specific use to be developed on property in an area that is not appropriate for
all uses allowed or conditional in the requested zone. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.020: INITIATION OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
A.   A development agreement may be initiated for the rezoning of a particular
parcel of land or collection of parcels of land through the following methods:
   1.   On application by the property owner.
   2.   On recommendation of the administrator.
   3.   On recommendation of the commission.
   4.   Required by the council.
B.   In the event that the commission determines that a development agreement
should be entered into, the commission shall retain jurisdiction of the matter,
defer consideration of the rezone applied for and set a time limit for
submittal of the development agreement. The commission shall then proceed as
specified in this chapter.
C.   In the event of a determination by the council that a development
agreement should be entered into, the council shall remand the matter back to
the commission for submittal of the development agreement. The council may
direct the commission on remand of the matter to the commission. The commission
shall then proceed as specified in this chapter.
In the event of either of the above, all time limits required by this code may
be stayed upon affirmative vote of the commission or council. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.030: FORM OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
A.   Development agreement shall be in the form required by the administrator
and approved by the city attorney. No agreement shall be accepted by the
administrator which does not include the following:
   1.   An affidavit by the owner of the parcel agreeing to submit the parcel
to a development agreement.
   2.   The specific use or uses of the parcel for which the development
agreement is sought.
   3.   The allowed or special use in the conditional zone for which
application has been made.
   4.   A concept plan of the project to be developed on the parcel. The
concept plan shall include:
      a.   A description of the density allowed or sought; and
      b.   Maximum height, size, and location of any structures on the
property.
      c.   The time required to begin the use on the property.
      d.   A statement by the owner of the parcel that failure to comply with
the commitments in the development agreement shall be deemed consent to rezone
the use to the preexisting zone or, in the case of an initial zone at
annexation, a zone deemed appropriate by the council.
      e.   Any other matter mutually agreeable to the parties. (Ord. 1070,
2010)
17.120.040: APPROVAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
A.   The council may require a development agreement be executed to allow a
rezone if, in the opinion of the council, approval of the requested rezone does
not satisfy the requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance for rezone
approval, but the particular project or use contemplated has a value to the
community that would justify the use of a development agreement. A development
agreement may not allow a use on the parcel that is not an allowed or special
use in the requested rezone.
B.   Development agreements may be recommended by the commission and approved
by the council only after public hearings before each body. Each public hearing
shall follow the notice provisions of
chapter 17.90 of this title for hearings on zoning map amendments.
C.   The council may add conditions, terms, duties or obligations to the
development agreement. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.050: RECORDATION OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
Following approval of a development agreement by the council, the development
agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder at the expense
of the property owner. The development agreement, and all conditions, terms,
duties or obligations included therein, shall run with the land and shall be
considered continuing obligations of the owner or subsequent owner and each
other person acquiring an interest in the property. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.060: DUTY TO COMPLY WITH DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
An owner, subsequent owner, and each other person acquiring an interest in
property that is restricted by a development agreement adopted pursuant to this
chapter, shall comply with the terms, conditions, obligations and duties
contained in the development agreement. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.070: MODIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
A development agreement may be modified by the council only after complying
with the notice and public hearing provisions of section 67-6509 of the Idaho
Code and
chapter 17.90 of this title. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.080: TERMINATION OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
A development agreement may be terminated by the council for failure to comply
with the commitments expressed in the development agreement. Such termination
shall take place after a public hearing on the termination at which time
testimony shall be taken to establish noncompliance with the conditions, terms,
obligations or duties contained within the development agreement. The public
hearing shall follow the notice and hearing provisions of section 67-6509 of
the Idaho Code and
 chapter 17.90 of this title.
Upon termination of the development agreement, the property shall revert to the
zone applicable prior to the adoption of the development agreement or
application for rezoning designation change. All uses of the property which are
not consistent with the subsequently applied zone following termination of the
development agreement shall cease. The owner of the parcel may apply for a
special use of the parcel if such use is a special use within the subsequently
applied zone. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.120.090: ENFORCEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
Development agreements may be enforced by the city through specific
enforcement, injunctive relief, damages or criminal penalty for violation of
this chapter. The foregoing enforcement options available to the city shall not
be deemed exclusive. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
CHAPTER 17.130
MINIMAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
SECTION:
17.130.010: Purpose
17.130.020: Definitions
17.130.030: Minimal Property Maintenance Standard
17.130.040: Restoration Of A Damaged Or Dilapidated Building Or Completion Of
An Unfinished Building
17.130.050: Enforcement Procedures
17.130.060: Restoration And Demolition Fund
17.130.070: Recovery Of Cost Of Restoration Or Demolition
17.130.010: PURPOSE:
The city, exercising its police powers to preserve the general welfare of the
city, promote economic viability and prevent urban blight, hereby establishes
minimal property maintenance standards. Beyond being secured so that a building
is not a danger or an attractive nuisance, all property within the city shall
be maintained to the minimal property maintenance standards as listed below.
(Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.020: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:
   DAMAGED OR DILAPIDATED BUILDING: Any structure that has suffered significant
damage or deterioration either from age, lack of care, or abandonment or
natural or manmade calamity to the degree that the exterior of the building
walls, roof, doors and windows are burnt out, falling down, or are
significantly patched or boarded or are structurally unsound.
   UNFINISHED BUILDING: Any structure where construction has commenced but has
been discontinued for a period of six (6) months and/or has not been finished
in accordance with the approved building permit and cannot be certified for
occupancy or final building inspection. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.030: MINIMAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE STANDARD:
All damaged, dilapidated or unfinished buildings shall be restored or finished
to eliminate the detrimental visual damage or visual impact of the building(s).
A property owner shall take steps to restore or finish the building(s) per
plans approved by the administrator. No building or premises shall
detrimentally impact the surrounding neighborhood due to dilapidation,
deterioration, decay, abandonment or unfinished construction and render the
enjoyment of the property essentially uncomfortable or inconvenient to the
neighborhood. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.040: RESTORATION OF A DAMAGED OR DILAPIDATED BUILDING OR COMPLETION OF
AN UNFINISHED BUILDING:
Restoration of a damaged or dilapidated building or completion of work on an
unfinished building shall begin within six (6) months of the building becoming
damaged or dilapidated or being deemed unfinished by the city. The city may
require that such buildings that are also unoccupied be secured (fenced or
boarded up) during the six (6) month period. This deadline may be extended by
the administrator upon submission of documentation of insurance settlement
delays or similar complications beyond the owner's control. Restoration of a
damaged or dilapidated building, or completion of an unfinished building shall
be completed within one year from the date that the restoration work or
unfinished construction work is initiated. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.050: ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES:
A.   If a building is not maintained at a minimal property maintenance standard
for six (6) months or no efforts to restore or finish a building have begun
within six (6) months or completed within one year after restoration or
construction work has begun, the city shall order the owner of the property to
attend a prescribed council meeting to address the reason(s) as to why the
building has not been restored or completed. If the address of the owner of
said building can be obtained through reasonable efforts, then the owner shall
receive notice of said meeting via certified mail. Otherwise notice shall be
sent to the owner of property as it appears on the last equalized assessment
roll of Jerome County, or as otherwise known to the administrator. Removal of
the damaged, dilapidated or unfinished building shall be ordered only if the
following findings are made:
   1.   The building meets the definition of a "damaged or dilapidated
building", or "unfinished building"; and
   2.   The building has existed in a damaged or dilapidated or unfinished
state for a period of at least six (6) months; or
   3.   The building has not been maintained at the minimal property standards
for a period of six (6) months; and
   4.   The property owner has previously received written notice that the
building is in violation of this code and must be restored or finished; or
notice has been sent to the owner of property as it appears on the last
equalized assessment roll of Jerome County, or as known to the administrator.
B.   The council, upon finding that the building is damaged, dilapidated or
unfinished, and that the property owner has not commenced or completed
restoration or finished the building within the time frames as set forth in
this chapter, may proceed to obtain bids to restore the building or clear the
site of the offending building. The fact that the building is not a danger or
attractive visual nuisance shall not be a defense for failing to restore or
finish a building. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.060: RESTORATION AND DEMOLITION FUND:
The city shall establish a revolving fund to be designated for building
restoration and demolition pursuant to this chapter. Payments shall be made out
of this fund upon the direction of the council to defray the costs and expenses
associated with restoration or demolition of said building. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
17.130.070: RECOVERY OF COST OF RESTORATION OR DEMOLITION:
The city clerk/treasurer's department, in coordination with the administrator,
shall keep an itemized account of the expenses incurred with restoration or
demolition of a building. A certified mailed copy of said assessment shall be
sent to the property owner. If the property owner does not respond within sixty
(60) days, then the city may recover costs of the abatement in a civil action
or by filing a certified copy of the assessment with the Jerome County recorder
on or before August 1 of the year and/or other legal proceeding initiated by
the city. The description of the parcel(s) reported shall be those used for the
same parcel(s) on the Jerome County assessor's map for the current year. All
such assessments remaining unpaid after thirty (30) days from the date of
recording on the assessment roll shall become delinquent and shall bear
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum or the current interest
rate if higher, from and after said date. All money recovered by payment of the
charge or assessment or from the sale of the property at a foreclosure sale
shall be paid to the city of Jerome, who shall credit the same to the
restoration and demolition fund. (Ord. 1070, 2010)
