01-23-01: TITLE:
This article shall be known as the CANYON COUNTY BUSINESS INVESTMENT INCENTIVE
ORDINANCE OF 2017. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-03: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
This article is enacted pursuant to authority conferred by article 12, section
2, Idaho Constitution, and Idaho Code sections 31-714, 31-801, 31-828, and 63-
602NN.
The purpose of this article is to provide objective criteria for determining
the amount of incentive tax relief that is proportional to the significant
economic benefits produced by a proposed project. Placing these criteria in an
ordinance provides prospective applicants with information for planning and
makes the process more transparent.
Because Property Tax incentives effectively shift the tax burden to other
taxpayers, it is important that significant benefits accrue to the public good,
primarily in the form of high-paying jobs and increased property values. As a
result, exemptions should not be granted unless the Board of County
Commissioners ("Board") finds that a combination of direct and indirect
benefits to the community from a proposed project substantially exceeds the
projected cost of the tax shift. These criteria are intended to help make those
determinations.
While the purpose of Property Tax incentives is to both attract new businesses
and retain existing business, relevant incentives may differ. Therefore, in
some respects, new and existing businesses are evaluated differently. The
provisions of this article will also be applied to applications filed under
Idaho Code section 63-606A, except when specifically inconsistent therewith.
(Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-05: DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS:
The words and phrases included in this article shall be given their regular and
ordinary meaning. Legal terms shall be given the meanings applicable to Idaho
Code section 63-602NN when applicable, and when not defined therein, as
otherwise provided by applicable Idaho law. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-07: PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS:
Prospective applicants, or their authorized agents, may request to meet with
the Board to engage in preliminary negotiations and discussions regarding
incentives. Applicants may operate under a pseudonym and meetings may be held
in executive session under Idaho Code section 74-206(1)(e) if an agent of the
prospective applicant with authority to negotiate is present, and when approved
by the Board. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-09: PROJECT PLAN:
Prior to completing an application, prospective applicants should prepare a
written project plan that addresses all requirements under Idaho Code section
63-602NN. The project plan can be used during preliminary negotiations, and
must be included as part of any application. A spreadsheet showing the nature
and timing of investments and proposed exemptions should be part of the project
plan. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-11: APPLICATION:
In order to be considered, an application must include a project plan. An
application can be filed under a pseudonym, but no application will be granted
until: 1) the prospective applicant has secured the right to obtain or secure a
particular property, and 2) the applicant is prepared to make the project
public. No exemption can be granted under a pseudonym. Application must be made
on a form provided by the Assessor's Office. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-13: APPROVAL PROCESS:
Applications will initiate final negotiations and preparation of documents that
will be necessary for the Board to consider and approve an exemption. Once
documents are prepared, a public meeting will be placed on the Board's agenda
and notice will be provided as required by Idaho Code section 63-602NN(5). At
the public meeting, the Board will consider the application and make
determinations regarding whether exemptions will be granted, and if so, to what
extent. In doing so, the Board will be guided by the criteria set forth in this
article. Applicants must be prepared to have their identity made public once
the public meeting is scheduled. (Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018)
01-23-15: NEW BUSINESS INVESTMENT:
It is the intent of the Board to provide incentives for investments in new
business where the new business:
   (1)   Demonstrates and certifies that "but for the incentive", the business
would not locate in the County but would locate at another specific locale;
   (2)   Creates jobs that pay competitive wages that exceed the average wage
(including benefits) for the County as determined by the State of Idaho;
   (3)   Demonstrates significant indirect benefits; and
   (4)   Agrees to all terms and conditions imposed by the Board, including,
but not limited to, recoupment provisions that might encumber project property.
Businesses that meet these criteria may be eligible for the following
incentives:
 
Level I investment:     
 Investment           $500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00
 Net new job creation 10 or more
 Exemption            Maximum 40 percent for up to 3 years
 
Level II investment:
 Investment                        $3,000,000.01 - $499,999,999.99
 Net new job creation              20 or more
 Maximum exemption:                Multiplier < 2.0 Multiplier > 2.0
  Real & personal property year 1 75%              90%
  Real & personal property year 2 75%              80%
  Real & personal property year 3 50%              70%
  Real & personal property year 4 25%              60%
  Real & personal property year 5 25%              50%
                                                  
Level III Investment:
 Investment:                       $500,000,000 or more
 Net new job creation:             350 or more
 Maximum exemption:                Multiplier < 2.0 Multiplier > 2.0
  Real & personal property year 1 90%              100%
  Real & personal property year 2 80%              100%
  Real & personal property year 3 70%              100%
  Real & personal property year 4 60%              100%
  Real & personal property year 5 50%              100%
 
The multiplier is the “employment multiplier” as determined for that project by
the Idaho Department of Commerce. A 2.0 multiplier means that for every job
created by the project, one additional job is created indirectly. Both the
investment and job creation requirements of a level must be met to be eligible
for that level. Investment includes only qualified investments as defined by
Idaho Code section 63-602NN. In no event can an exemption be made unless it
qualifies under Idaho Code section 63-602NN. Exemptions are only available
under level I for projects located outside of Nampa and. Exemptions are not
available under levels I, II, and/or III investments for housing and
residential buildings or facilities.
(Ord. 18-031, 11-15-2018; amd. Ord. 22-020, 9-13-2022)
01-23-17: NEW INVESTMENT IN EXISTING BUSINESS:
It is the intent of the Board to provide incentives for investments in existing
business under the same criteria and limitations as set forth in section
01-23-15: of this article, with the following modifications:

02-01-05: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this article, the following definitions shall apply:
ABATEMENT: The affirmative act of removing, repairing, or taking other steps as
may be necessary to remedy a nuisance.
PUBLIC NUISANCE: A public nuisance is a condition or use of property which is
harmful or injurious to, or creates a danger of harm or injury to the health,
safety, or welfare of the neighborhood, community, or members of the public, or
which is so offensive to the senses or such an obstruction of the free use of
property as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by
the neighborhood, community, or members of the public, including by way of
example the following:
   (1)   A condition or use of premises or property which creates a fire hazard
or any traffic or safety hazard to members of the public.
   (2)   A condition or use of premises or property which creates a health
hazard by permitting, allowing, or fostering the harboring and nesting of
rodents, vermin and/or insects, or which creates any other type of health
hazard to members of the public.
   (3)   A condition or use of premises or property which allows the open
storage, deposit, or scattering of scrap lumber or wood, waste petroleum
products, scrap or waste paper, trash, garbage, junk, boxes, recyclable
materials or debris of any type.
   (4)   A condition or use of premises or property which allows the open
storage, deposit, or scattering of scrap, abandoned, discarded, or unused

mechanical parts.
   (5)   A condition or use of premises or property which allows the open
storage, deposit, or scattering of dismantled or partially dismantled, wrecked,
junked, scrapped, discarded and nonoperating motor vehicles or parts thereof,

unless two (2) or more motor vehicles or parts thereof not in operating
condition remain standing on the property for more than ten (10) calendar days.
   (6)   A condition or use of premises or property which allows the growth of
weeds, grasses, bushes, shrubs, trees, or other plant life to such a size and
in such a condition as to cause, or reasonably threaten to cause a fire hazard
because of their dried and unkept condition, or a traffic or safety hazard
because they obstruct sight, applying the measurements and standards contained
in Idaho Code section 49-221, at intersections or other points at which
driveways, lanes, or highways come together.
   (7)   A condition or use of premises or property which allows the growth of
weeds, grasses, bushes, shrubs, trees or other plant life to such a size and in
such a condition as to cause, or reasonably threaten to cause a health hazard
because they provide nesting areas for rodents, vermin and/or insects, or the
growth of weeds to such a size or in such a condition as to interfere with the
free and comfortable use of adjacent and neighboring premises and properties.
SUMMARY ABATEMENT: The abatement of a public nuisance by the County, or by a
contractor hired by the County, without obligation to give prior notice of the
abatement action to the owner or occupant of the property.

has charge or possession.
   (2)   Agricultural Operations: The application and enforcement of this

designated Code Enforcement Officer(s), shall be responsible for the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article.

person or persons or an entity of any kind, shall be presumed to be responsible
for creating, causing, committing, maintaining, and/or allowing such nuisance.
Such owner of record shall be subject to any and all penalties imposed as set
forth herein, and shall be responsible for payment of any and all costs
incurred in abating the nuisance. The owner of record shall bear the burden of
rebutting this presumption. (Ord. 18-016, 6-27-2018)
02-01-09: CIVIL ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE:
   (1)   Request For Voluntary Compliance: If it is determined by a Code
Enforcement Officer that a nuisance exists on any property, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall cause a written request for voluntary compliance to
be issued to the owner, occupier, and/or person in control of such property.
Such request for voluntary compliance shall contain the street address and
parcel number of the property, describe the nuisance existing thereon, request
voluntary action to eliminate the nuisance, and establish the time period for
voluntary elimination of said nuisance, which shall be ten (10) days from the
date of the request for voluntary compliance.
   (2)   Order Of Abatement: If, following the issuance of a request for
voluntary compliance pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, a Code
Enforcement Officer finds that a nuisance still exists on any property, the
officer shall cause an order of abatement to be issued to the owner, occupier,
and/or person in control of such property. Such order of abatement shall
contain the street address and parcel number of the property, describe the
nuisance existing thereon, order the abatement of the nuisance, establish the
time period for abatement, specify the penalty for noncompliance, and describe
the opportunity and time for appeal. The Code Enforcement Officer shall issue
such order of abatement to the owner, occupier, or person in control of the
property on which the nuisance exists in one or more of the following ways:

property.
   (3)   Time Period For Abatement: It shall be the duty of the owner,
occupier, or person in charge or control of any property where any nuisance
exists, to abate such nuisance within ten (10) calendar days from notice
pursuant to this section, however, the Code Enforcement Officer may require
summary abatement of a nuisance condition where such condition presents an
imminent threat to human health or safety.
   (4)   Summary Abatement: Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Code
Enforcement Officer from requiring, undertaking, or causing summary abatement
of a nuisance condition where such condition presents an imminent threat to
human health or safety.
   (5)   Appeal: Within seven (7) calendar days from the date of service,
mailing, or posting of the order of abatement, the owner, occupier, and/or
person in charge or control of the subject property may appeal to the Board by
filing a written appeal with the issuing Code Enforcement Officer, which appeal
shall enumerate the grounds for appeal. The Board shall consider written and
oral testimony from the appellant and shall affirm, withdraw, or modify the
order of abatement. The decision of the Board shall be final. If the Board
affirms the order, the appellant shall have five (5) calendar days from the
date of such affirmation to abate the nuisance as ordered.
   (6)   Abatement Procedures: The Board, upon recommendation by the Code
Enforcement Officer and after providing notice as provided herein, may abate or
cause the abatement of any nuisance where the owner, occupant, agent or person
in control of property does not comply with abatement notice. If the Board
directs the abatement of the nuisance a service fee shall be imposed against
the owner of the subject property for services provided. The fees imposed
pursuant to this section shall be reasonably related to, but shall not exceed,
the actual cost of the service being rendered. The Board shall cause the fee to
be collected in the following manner:
      A.   Recovery Of Abatement Service Fee: Canyon County shall send to the
owner, occupier, and/or person in control of the subject property, by regular
mail, a billing statement requiring payment to cover the costs of abating the
nuisance and the administrative services as established by fee schedule. Unless
paid as voluntarily, as provided below, such charge shall be collected in the
same manner provided by law for the collection of real and personal Property
Taxes.
      B.   Automatic Lien Of Abatement Service Fee: Upon abatement, an
automatic lien in the amount of the abatement service fee shall attach to the
subject property, and a notice of lien shall be recorded within seventy two
(72) hours. Upon payment of the charges in full the lien shall be released.
      C.   Certification Of Abatement Costs: If full payment is not made within
thirty (30) days of the mailing of the billing statement requiring payment of
abatement service fee, the Board shall certify such charge to be placed on the
Property Tax roll.
   (7)   Certificate Of Noncompliance: In lieu of abatement, the Board may
record a Certificate of Noncompliance detailing the violations existing on the
property. Such certificate shall be removed upon remedy of the enumerated
violation.
   (8)   Injunction: The County may also take civil action to obtain an order
enjoining the ongoing maintenance of such property free from nuisance, and/or
to recover any and all costs enforcement and/or litigation including, but not
limited to attorney fees and court costs. (Ord. 18-016, 6-27-2018; amd. Ord.
22-005, 3-29-2022)
02-01-11: CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE:
It shall be unlawful for any person who allows the existence of a public
nuisance to continue after a request for voluntary compliance. Each and every
day in which any such violation continues after ten (10) days from the date of
the request for voluntary compliance may be deemed a separate offense. Upon
conviction violations shall be punishable according to section
01-01-07 of the County's Ordinance, General Penalty. Criminal enforcement shall
not foreclose use of other remedies in this chapter. The Canyon County Sheriff
and/or designated Code Enforcement Officer(s) shall have the authority to issue

2-1-1993)
02-03-03: TRANSPORTATION OF SOLID WASTE:
   (1)   Purpose: The public highways, as well as public and private lands
adjacent to said public highways, leading to the various solid waste disposal
sites in Canyon County are being littered with paper, cans, bottles and trash
of every description because a small number of the people transporting solid
waste to solid waste disposal sites are not properly covering or securing their
loads and are thereby allowing solid waste of all kinds to blow, fall and
scatter from the vehicles transporting the solid waste. It is the purpose of
this section and the duty of the board of county commissioners to require that
all persons hauling garbage, refuse, rubbish, tree limbs, trash or solid waste
of any kind, provide a proper cover and secure their load so as to prevent the
scattering, blowing or loss of the materials being so transported. This section
is enacted pursuant to authority given to the board of county commissioners by
article 12, section 2, of the Idaho constitution which authorizes the county to
make and enforce within its limits all such local policies, sanitary and other
regulations as are not in conflict with the general laws, and Idaho Code
section 31-714 which empowers the board of county commissioners to pass all
ordinances and rules and make all regulations, not repugnant to law, necessary
for carrying into effect or discharging the powers and duties conferred by the
laws of the state of Idaho, and such as are necessary or proper to provide for
the safety, promote the health and prosperity, improve the morals, peace and
good order, comfort and convenience of the county and the inhabitants thereof,
and for the protection of property therein.

distribution, preparation, cooking and serving of food and wastes from the
handling, processing, storage, distribution and sale of products.
   REFUSE: Garbage, rubbish and animal carcasses.
   RUBBISH: All nonputrescible solid waste except abandoned vehicles and car

02-03-05: of this article.
   SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SITE 1 : The only lawful site(s) for the dumping and

at Pickles Butte in Canyon County, Idaho, or any other site specifically
approved by the board of county commissioners.
   TRASH: Includes papers, bottles, nails and refuse of all kinds not otherwise
described or referred to herein.
   (3)   Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person hauling garbage,
refuse, rubbish or trash of any kind upon the public highways of Canyon County
outside the corporate limits of any municipality within Canyon County to haul
garbage, refuse, rubbish or trash without covering and securing such garbage,
refuse, rubbish or trash in such a manner as to prevent scattering or blowing
or loss of the material being so transported. (Ord. 05-011, 4-6-2005)

supply treatment plant or air pollution control facility and other discarded
material, including solid, liquid, semisolid or contained gaseous material
resulting from industrial, commercial, mining and agricultural operations, and
from community activities, but does not include solid or dissolved materials in
domestic sewage or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial
discharges that are point sources subject to permits under 33 USC 1342, or
source, special, nuclear or byproduct material as defined by the atomic energy
act of 1954, as amended; 68 statute 923. (Ord. 93-001, 1-26-1993, eff. 2-1-

Dumping and depositing of solid waste at the Pickles Butte site or any other
site specifically approved by the board of county commissioners shall be
limited to persons and companies who generate waste and reside in or whose
principal place of business is within the boundaries of Canyon County, Idaho.
This limitation is enacted in order to assure the continued availability of the
Pickles Butte site to Canyon County users. An exemption to this prohibition may
be granted by the administrator of solid waste department, in his discretion,
up to five (5) cubic yards for each load. Exemptions in greater amounts may be
granted by the board of county commissioners based upon clear and convincing
evidence of fact: 1) that such waste was generated out of county by Canyon
County residents, or 2) that the continued availability for the Pickles Butte

board of county commissioners to be reasonably related to the health, safety,
and welfare of Canyon County residents. If the board denies an application for
an exemption, the unsuccessful applicant must file for a reconsideration of the
denial and request a reconsideration hearing within five (5) days of the denial
of their application. The reconsideration hearing before the board shall be
conducted in accordance with Idaho Code, sections 67-5210, 67-5211 and 67-5212,
as may be amended from time to time. The failure to timely request a
reconsideration hearing shall mean the applicant forfeits his right to a
reconsideration hearing. Said hearing shall be held within ten (10) days of the
date the request for hearing is filed with the board. Any appeal of the board's
decision shall be made to district court and shall be subject to procedures set
forth at IRCP 83(C), 83(K), and 83(U). Such an appeal is to be heard as an
appellate proceeding and shall not involve a trial de novo. (Ord. 93-001, 1-26-

      B.    Those persons or companies who have applied for, and been extended
charge privileges, will be billed monthly by the solid waste division, and
payment must be made within thirty (30) days of the billing. Late payments will

incurred in carrying out the provisions of this article, said lien and/or tax
assessment shall be in favor of the Idaho department of agriculture, otherwise,

02-09-01: PURPOSE:
Trauma involved in medical emergency situations results in severe risk to life
and health. In a rural county such as Canyon County it is critical to the
public health, safety and welfare that coordinated, quality ambulance and
emergency medical assistance be available promptly. In November 1977, a group
of concerned citizens filed a petition, pursuant to Idaho Code section 31-3908,
requesting that an ambulance district be established. The board of
commissioners of Canyon County established the Canyon County ambulance district
which has continued to serve the ambulance and emergency medical needs of the
whole county.
Such needs are served by the equipment and personnel of the Canyon County
ambulance district, by a network of quick response units and by volunteer
ambulance services. In the years since the Canyon County ambulance district was
first established, the population of Canyon County has increased dramatically.
In addition to its continued rural nature, the county has become an integral
part of the industrial development of southwest Idaho and serves as a critical
link in the transportation corridor which ties Boise and Ada County to eastern
Oregon. During this time there have been new developments in emergency
communications and medical techniques. The Idaho board of medicine and the
emergency medical service bureau of the Idaho department of health and welfare
have established standards for licensing and certification of equipment and
personnel. Canyon County is now served by an enhanced 911 emergency dispatch
system. As these developments have occurred, it has become even more important
to maintain coordination of the ambulance and emergency medical services
available to the county's residents. (Ord. 03-013, 12-11-2003)

officer may seize and impound the animal pending the aforesaid hearings. The
owner of the animal shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of
impoundment of such animal.
      H.    Appeal From Magistrate Court: The decision of the magistrate court
may be appealed to the district court by an aggrieved party within forty two

legal substances such as pseudoephedrine, which is contained in certain over
the counter medicines sold in retail outlets. Methamphetamine is produced and
distributed in our communities with negative social effects, including harm to
children, families, increasing crime and property damage. The production of
methamphetamine in illegal labs can cause significant health and safety risks

production byproducts. The legislature of the state of Idaho has not enacted
any laws to control pseudoephedrine products that have been prepared for
dispensing or over the counter distribution. The board of county commissioners
deems it to be in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of Canyon County to regulate the over the counter distribution of
certain pseudoephedrine products within the county.

prohibited by this article if the owner submits to the Canyon County sheriff a
verified statement from a reputable testing laboratory regularly engaged in the
testing of such equipment or similar equipment certifying that the capacity of
the winch or boom is not less than that mandated for the class for which the
equipment will be used. All costs of such testing and certification shall be at
the expense of the emergency tow company.
   (3)   Classes Of Tow Trucks: Commercial tow trucks are divided into the
following classes based on the manufacturer's rating:
      A.    Class A tow truck equipment must have a minimum manufacturer's boom
or combined boom rating of four (4) tons and must be mounted on a truck chassis
with a minimum manufacturer's rating of ten thousand (10,000) pounds' gross
vehicle weight. Class A trucks may only be used for specialty off road tows.
      B.    Class B tow truck equipment must have a minimum manufacturer's boom
or combined boom rating of eight (8) tons and must be mounted on a truck
chassis with a minimum manufacturer's rating of eighteen thousand (18,000)
pounds' gross vehicle weight.
      C.    Class C tow truck equipment must have a minimum manufacturer's boom
or combined boom rating of sixteen (16) tons and must be mounted on a chassis
that has a minimum manufacturer's rating of thirty two thousand (32,000)
pounds' gross vehicle weight.
      D.    Class D tow truck equipment includes manufactured rollbacks and car
carriers with manufacturer's gross vehicle ratings of ten thousand (10,000)
pounds and over. The rollbacks and car carriers must be mounted on a truck-
trailer chassis that, at a minimum, is equal to the minimum gross weight of the
rollback or car carrier. Class D also includes any piece of towing equipment
without a boom.
      E.    Class E includes two (2) or more tow trucks working together with a
combined manufacturer's rating of a minimum of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds
with access to supportive equipment, such as forklifts, banders, and air bags,
for the recovery of rollovers and wrecked, disabled, and abandoned vehicles
whose cargo requires special handling. Class E refers to tow truck companies
and not to tow truck equipment.
   (4)   Specifications:
      A.    An operator of any noncommercially manufactured or modified tow
truck equipment must have its equipment independently certified before
participating in the law enforcement rotation system. Once the equipment is
classified, further modifications to the equipment must be recertified.
      B.    Each tow truck and all of its equipment shall be maintained in a
safe and good working order at all times. Tow truck operators on the rotation,
must receive all state and nationally recognized operator's certification
training required by industry standards within the profession or required by
law.
      C.    Each tow truck shall be permanently painted and lettered with
company colors and company names, address, city and telephone number, on both
sides of the tow truck, before use for law enforcement towing services. Said
company colors shall be provided to the Canyon County sheriff. No magnetic
stripping and/or signs may be used.
      D.    Tow companies wishing to be placed upon the rotation, must provide
proof that their equipment meets all applicable safety and statutory standards.
The inspection officer, by approving an application for placement on the tow
rotation, will rely upon the tow company's representations. Placement on the
tow rotation is in no way a warranty or endorsement that the tow company's
equipment meets industry or statutory standards.
Canyon County, its employees and inspection officer, while acting within the
course and scope of their employment, shall not be liable for any claim as
specified under Idaho Code section 6-904B. (Ord. 15-003, 2-27-2015)
03-19-27: FEES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TOWING:
   (1)   Fees for services provided by tow companies pursuant to this article
shall be set by resolution of the board of Canyon County commissioners upon the
recommendation of the sheriff. Applications by tow companies to be placed on
the law enforcement towing rotation shall be considered knowledge and consent
by the applicant to abide by the provisions of this article. Failure to adhere
to the established fee rates is cause for immediate removal from the law
enforcement tow rotation list.
   (2)   The established fees apply to law enforcement towing only. The fees
shall set from the maximum amount a tow company is permitted to charge for
different categories of vehicles for mileage rates, hourly rates, and vehicle
storage, as described below. Tow companies shall not charge any additional fees
or costs in addition to the established categories, unless approved by the
inspection officer/tow coordinator on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the
process established in this article. Tow companies may charge less than the
established fees.
      A.   Mileage Rate. Mileage rates can only be charged for loaded miles,
which is the mileage from point of hook up to a tow vehicle to the tow
company's place of business, or vehicle drop off point, via reasonable and
customaiy routes.
      B.   Hourly Rate. The hourly rate is the maximum allowable rate charged
if all services, processes, and labor are provided. Charges for all services,
processes, and labor associated with a vehicle tow, other than mileage and
vehicle charges, shall be part of the hourly rate. This includes, but is not
limited to, fees and charges for callout/hook-up, winching, labor to perform
preparation of tow, cleanup of debris and fluid, drive-line removal, recovery,
use of dollies, snatch blocks and skates. Not every vehicle tow will require
every available process or service, therefore it is anticipated that routine
vehicle tows will not incur maximum hourly rates.
      Tow companies shall only charge one hourly rate fee regardless of the
number of representatives responding to the call; hourly rate charges for
multiple representatives must be approved as a fee adjustment. Tow companies
may implement the equivalent of one full hour at the hourly rate as a minimum
hourly rate charge. After the first hour of a tow service, the hourly rate
shall be applied on a thirty (30) minute prorated basis as follows:
 
5-30 minutes  50% of the hourly rate
31-60 minutes 100% of the hourly rate
 
      C.   Vehicle Storage Rate. The vehicle storage rate is the maximum rate a
tow company may charge for storage of any towed vehicle. Storage fees may be
assessed for each eligible calendar day a vehicle is stored. Vehicles stored
for a period of twenty-four (24) hours or less shall not be charged for
storage. Vehicle storage shall not be charged if, for any reason, the tow
company is not open during normal office hours for vehicle retrieval, unless
the vehicle has been in storage with available retrieval for more than seven
(7) days.
   (3)   There shall be no charge for the release of personal property from
towed vehicles during normal business hours, except as allowed by Idaho Code
section 49-1814. The maximum charge for releasing personal property or vehicles
after regular business hours is the equivalent of one full hour at the hourly
rate.
   (4)   Tow Company Fee Adjustments. All fees charged by tow companies are
subject to review by the inspection officer/tow coordinator. A tow company may
have occasional need to apply charges or fees that exceed the established fees,
and vehicle owners may have reason to contest fees charged to tow their
vehicles. The inspection officer/tow coordinator shall have the authority to
approve any additional/excess charges, deny any additional or excess charges,
or adjust the towing fee to reflect the proper amount to be charged for the tow
service based on the specific circumstances. Reasonable tow fee adjustments, as
determined by the inspection officer/tow coordinator, will not be denied. The
rationale supporting the fee adjustment decision will be provided in writing
upon request. The sheriff will establish a fee adjustment process for tow
companies and vehicle owners.
   (5)   Tow companies shall be entitled to request a closed hearing with the
inspection officer/tow coordinator to review any fee adjustment decision. The
closed hearing request must be submitted in writing within three (3) business
days of notice of the inspection officer/tow coordinator's decision. Appeal of
the decision to adjust fees is governed by subsection
03-19-23(6) of this article.
   (6)   A tow company on the law enforcement tow rotation shall not increase
its law enforcement rates or fees during the rotation year, except as provided
in this section. Tow companies agree to provide prompt refund of any paid fees
that are determined to be excessive by the inspection officer/tow coordinator.
   (7)   Rates and fees may be reviewed and changed by the board of Canyon
County commissioners at its discretion and upon consultation with the sheriff.
Any proposed changes to rates and fees must be submitted in writing to the
Canyon County sheriff by the last day of the inspection period. Approved
changes are effective on the first day of the new rotation date. A request for
rate and fee changes may be made during the rotation year where the party
seeking the modification articulates in writing a substantial change in costs
justifying the requested revision. (Ord. 15-003, 2-27-2015; amd. Ord. 2024-002,
6-27-2024)
03-19-29: REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR EMERGENCY TOW COMPANIES:

rise to the refusal being timely provided and approved by the inspection
officer.
   (3)   Arrive at the accident within a reasonable time after having been
notified to do so by dispatch. Such response time shall not exceed forty five

estimated arrival time. If tow company is unable to respond within forty five
(45) minutes dispatch will then move to the next tow company on the rotation.

bordered by a chainlink, steel, concrete fence or other approved materials not
less than six feet (6') in height; provided further that said lot shall be

inventoried, which are not taken by law enforcement, shall remain in the
custody and control of the tow company until released to the owner. If any item
(s) is of an estimated value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more, and
cannot be secured in the vehicle or in a secured area within the tow lot, the
property shall be taken to the corresponding law enforcement office and a
property invoice left in the vehicle or given to the vehicle owner, if the
owner is available, at the time the vehicle is impounded.
   (6)   When authorized by the law enforcement agency, in every instance,

not be measured along an inclined surface or line. For uses that have a
separation standard, the distance shall be measured from the nearest point of
the proposed use to the nearest property line of the specified use. The

within that area. This procedure provides that the commission, and subsequently
the board, considers the overall development scheme of the county prior to
consideration of individual requests for amendments to zoning ordinances. The
commission, and subsequently the board, should make clear which of its findings
relate to the proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan and which of its
findings relate to the request for an amendment to the zoning ordinance.
   (4)   Zoning Ordinance Changes:

shall be established and clearly indicated, as soon as practicable, on the
zoning map or maps adopted as part of this chapter. The board shall, when
considering an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance, consider

comprehensive plan;
      B.    When considering the surrounding land uses, is the proposed land
use more appropriate than the current comprehensive plan designation;
      C.    Is the proposed comprehensive plan amendment compatible with
surrounding land uses;

change more appropriate than the current zoning designation;
      C.    Is the proposed zoning map amendment compatible with surrounding
land uses;

      F.    Does legal access to the subject property for the zoning map
amendment exist or will it exist at the time of development;
      G.    Does the proposed zoning map amendment require public street
improvements in order to provide adequate access to and from the subject
property to minimize undue interference with existing or future traffic
patterns created by the proposed development? What measures have been taken to
mitigate road improvements or traffic impacts; and
      H.    Will the proposed zoning map amendment impact essential public
services and facilities, such as schools, police, fire and emergency medical
services? What measures will be implemented to mitigate impacts? (Ord. 16-007,
6-20-2016)
07-06-07: CONDITIONAL REZONE:
   (1)   Restrictions: In approving a conditional rezone application, the
presiding party may establish conditions, stipulations, restrictions, or
limitations which restrict and limit the use of the rezoned property to less
than the full use allowed under the requested zone, and which impose specific
property improvement and maintenance requirements upon the requested land use.
Such conditions, stipulations, restrictions or limitations may be imposed to
promote the public health, safety and welfare, or to reduce any potential
damage, hazard, nuisance or other detriment to persons or property in the
vicinity to make the land use more compatible with neighboring land uses. When
the presiding party finds that such conditions, stipulations, restrictions or
limitations are necessary, land may be rezoned upon condition that if the land
is not used as approved, or if an approved use ends, the land use will revert
back to the zone applicable to the land immediately prior to the conditional
rezone action.
   (2)   Development Agreement: Any condition, stipulation, restriction or
limitation imposed pursuant to this article shall be incorporated as part of
any site plan, plat, document of title of conveyance and building permit
relating to the restricted land. Any predevelopment condition, stipulation,
restriction or limitation imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be verified
as being met prior to the issuance of any building permit. The applicant must
execute a written development agreement to implement and be bound by any such
condition, stipulation, restriction, or limitation. No final conditional rezone
action shall be taken until such development agreement is recorded in the
office of the county recorder. The development agreement shall have the effect
and impact provided by Idaho Code section 67-6511A. (Ord. 10-006, 8-16-2010)
   (3)   Conditional Rezoning Designation: Such restricted land shall be
designated by a CR (conditional rezoning) on the official zoning map upon
approval of a resolution by the board for an "order of intent to rezone". An
"order of intent to rezone" shall be submitted to the board for approval once
the specific use has commenced on the property and all required conditions of
approval have been met and any required improvements are in place. Land uses
that require approval of a subdivision shall have an approved final plat in
accordance with this chapter before the "order of intent to rezone" is
submitted for approval by the board. Designation of a parcel as CR shall not
constitute "spot" zoning and shall not be presumptive proof that the zoning of
other property adjacent to or in the vicinity of the conditionally rezoned
property should be rezoned the same.
   (4)   Time Requirements: All conditional rezones for a land use shall
commence (see definition of "commence", section
07-02-03: of this chapter) within two (2) years of the approval of the board.
If the conditional rezone has not commenced within the stated time requirement,
the application for a conditional rezone shall lapse and become void. All
subsequent developments on the property shall reapply for land use approval.
   (5)   Notice That Conditional Rezone Conditions Not Being Met: If any
person, including staff or member of the commission, files a written notice
presenting sufficient evidence, as determined by the director, to establish
that the rezone conditions have not been met, or that a use approved by
conditional rezoning has been abandoned or has ended, the commission shall
notice a public hearing pursuant to article 5 of this chapter, said hearing to
be conducted pursuant to article 5 of this chapter. The burden of proof at such
hearing shall be on the person who filed the notice. If the commission finds
that the rezone conditions are not being followed or that the use approved by
conditional rezoning has ended, it may recommend to the board a time schedule
for compliance or may recommend that the board order the zone to revert back to
the zone from which the property was conditionally rezoned, as provided by
subsection (7)I of this section. (Ord. 11-003, 3-16-2011)
   (6)   Conditional Rezone Approval:
      A.    Standards Of Evaluation: The presiding party shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of the proposed conditional rezone. The
presiding party shall apply the following standards when evaluating the
proposed conditional rezone:
         1.    Is the proposed conditional rezone generally consistent with the
comprehensive plan;
         2.    When considering the surrounding land uses, is the proposed
conditional rezone more appropriate than the current zoning designation;
         3.    Is the proposed conditional rezone compatible with surrounding
land uses;
         4.    Will the proposed conditional rezone negatively affect the
character of the area? What measures will be implemented to mitigate impacts?
         5.    Will adequate facilities and services including sewer, water,
drainage, irrigation and utilities be provided to accommodate proposed
conditional rezone;
         6.    Does the proposed conditional rezone require public street
improvements in order to provide adequate access to and from the subject
property to minimize undue interference with existing or future traffic
patterns? What measures have been taken to mitigate traffic impacts?
         7.    Does legal access to the subject property for the conditional
rezone exist or will it exist at time of development; and
         8.    Will the proposed conditional rezone amendment impact essential
public services and facilities, such as schools, police, fire and emergency
medical services? What measures will be implemented to mitigate impacts? (Ord.
16-007, 6-20-2016)
      B.    Conditions Must Be Met: If the commission recommends and the board
approves such order of preliminary rezoning, the order shall include any
conditions, stipulations, restrictions or limitations which the commission
recommends and the board finds are necessary to the public health, safety and
welfare. Such conditions, stipulations, restrictions or limitations must be met
before the "order of intent to rezone" is issued. The development agreement
must be signed and recorded before final approval is given.
      C.    Conditions Incorporated Into Document: Any conditions,
stipulations, restrictions or limitations imposed pursuant to this section
shall be incorporated as part of any site plan, plat, document of title of
conveyance, and building permit relating to the restricted land.
   (7)   Provisions Governing The Creation, Form, Recording, Modification,
Enforcement And Termination Of A Development Agreement:
      A.    Creation Of Development Agreement: The county may enter into a
development agreement with a developer for the development of real property in

         2.    Specify the permitted uses of the property, the density or
intensity of use, and the maximum height and size of proposed buildings;
         3.    Specify any ongoing performance of owner or developer and the
consequence for any owner's or developer's noncompliance therewith;
         4.    Provide, where appropriate, for reservation or dedication of
land for public purposes;
         5.    State that the development agreement shall not prevent the
county, in subsequent actions applicable to the property, from applying new
rules, regulations or policies that do not conflict with development agreements
applicable to the property as set forth in the agreement;
         6.    Provide that the director shall administer the development
agreements after such agreements become effective;
         7.    Provide that the director shall conduct a review of compliance
with the terms and conditions of the development agreement on a periodic basis
as established by the development agreement; and
         8.    Provide that a development agreement must be approved by the
board, upon recommendation of the commission, which recommendation may be
accepted, modified or rejected. A preliminary conditional rezoning approval
becomes final when the conditions set forth in the recorded development
agreement have been fully met by the developer as determined by the director,
in the exercise of the director's discretion including, but not limited to,
unforeseen circumstances.
      B.    Development Agreement Duration: The development agreement shall run
with the land and bind the property, only as in accordance with law, and shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties, and any of their
respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and assignees.
      C.    Subject Matter: The development agreement may also cover any other
matter not inconsistent with this chapter, which is reasonably related to the
project, and not prohibited by law.
      D.    Parties: In addition to the county and developer, any federal,
state or local government agency or body may be included as a party to the
development agreement. If more than one government body is made party to a
development agreement, the development agreement shall specify which agency
shall be responsible for the overall administration of the development
agreement.
      E.    Form Of Development Agreements: Development agreements shall
include, in the board's discretion, but not be limited to, a clear statement of
the intent of the parties in regard to entering the agreement, necessary real
property descriptions, schedules and exhibits, a detailed statement regarding
the development of the property, and periodic review, as established by the
development agreement. The development agreement shall address the requirements
and conditions for conditional rezoning approval and shall be accompanied by,
or include, a statement necessitating the need for a development agreement.
      F.    Modification Of Development Agreements: A development agreement by
a developer concerning the use or development of the subject parcel may be
modified only by permission of the board after complying with the notice and
hearing provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6509. The modification proposal
must be in the form of a revised development agreement and must be accompanied
by a statement demonstrating the necessity for the requested modification.
      G.    Recording Of Development Agreements: Development agreements or
amended development agreements shall be recorded by the director in the office
of the county recorder and shall take effect upon the adoption by the board.
The director shall provide a copy of the recorded development agreement or
amended development agreement to the prosecuting attorney and to the developer.
Should a development agreement be terminated by the county, and the zoning
designation upon which the use is based is reversed, a document authorizing
such termination and zoning reversal shall be recorded by the director in the
office of the county recorder and supplied to the same parties noted above.
      H.    Enforcement Of Development Agreements:
         1.    Unless terminated pursuant to subsection (7)I of this section, a
development agreement, amended development agreement, or modified development
agreement, shall be enforceable by any party thereto, or their successors in
interest, notwithstanding any subsequent change in any applicable law adopted
by the county which alters or amends the laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules,
or policies (hereafter referred to as "laws") specified in this section.
         2.    All laws governing permitted uses of the land that is the
subject of the development agreement, including, but not limited to, uses,
density, design, height, size, and building specifications of proposed
buildings, construction standards and specifications, and water utilization
requirements applicable to the development of the property subject to a
development agreement, shall be those laws made applicable and in force at the
time of execution of the development agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent
change in any applicable laws adopted by the county, which alter or amend the
laws specified in this section. Such subsequent change shall be void as applied
to the property subject to such development agreement to the extent that it
changes any laws which any party to the development agreement has agreed to
maintain in force as written at the time of execution; provided that a
development agreement shall not prevent the board from requiring the developer
to comply with laws of general applicability enacted subsequent to the date of
the development agreement, if they could have been lawfully applied to the
property which is the subject of the development agreement at the time of
execution of the development agreement, provided the board finds it necessary
to impose the requirements because a failure to do so would place the residents
of a subdivision or of the immediate community, or both, in a condition
perilous to the residents' health or safety, or both.
      I.    Termination Of Development Agreements:
         1.    A development agreement may be terminated and the zoning
designation upon which the use is based reversed, upon the failure of the
developer to comply with the provisions in the development agreement. The
developer shall comply with the requirements set forth in the development
agreement. A development agreement may be terminated only after complying with
the notice and hearing provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6509.
         2.    If, as a result of a periodic review, the director finds and
determines that the developer has committed a breach of the terms or conditions
of the development agreement, the director shall serve notice in writing,
within a reasonable time period after the periodic review, upon the developer
setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the
evidence supporting the finding and determination, and provide a reasonable
time period in which to cure such material breach. If the developer fails to
cure the breach within the time period given, the county may terminate or
modify the development agreement only after complying with the notice and
hearing provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6509 and subsection (5) of this
section.
   (8)   Final Rezoning Approval ("Order Of Intent To Rezone"): A conditional
rezoning approval becomes final when the conditions set forth in the
development agreement have been fully met by the developer. Such approval shall
be in the form of a board action known as an "order of intent to rezone", and
the property shall be designated by a CR mark on the official zoning map so
that persons using the map will be put on notice. Building permits may not be
issued until the "order of intent to rezone" is approved by the board and
recorded in the county recorder's office by the developer. (Ord. 10-006, 8-16-

07-07-01: PURPOSE:
Every use which requires the granting of a conditional use permit is declared
to possess characteristics which require review and appraisal by the commission
to determine whether or not the use would cause any damage, hazard, nuisance or
other detriment to persons or property in the vicinity. The commission may
require higher standards of site development than those listed specifically in
this chapter in order to assure that the proposed use will be compatible with
other property and uses in the vicinity. The commission may revoke or modify
its approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the hearing and appeals procedures found in article 5 of this chapter.

(Ord. 25-006, 4-18-2025)
07-09-09: EXPANSION OR MODIFICATION OF AN APA:
An expansion or modification of an existing APA shall follow the same
application, review, and hearing procedures outlined in this code. Any
expansion of an AP A shall be contiguous to the existing APA. (Ord. 25-006, 4-
18-2025)
07-09-11: TERMINATION OF AN APA:
A landowner wishing to terminate an AP A must request in writing a meeting with
the Board of County Commissioners. The meeting request shall include a proof of
undue hardship. The Board of County Commissioners shall acknowledge receipt of
the petition for removal in writing. Early termination of the APA shall only
occur upon the proving by the land owner of an undue hardship. The landowner
seeking to terminate an APA bears the burden of proof in demonstrating the
undue hardship. (Ord. 25-006, 4-18-2025)
07-09-13: ENROLLMENT DURATION:
Per Idaho State code, lands designated as an APA will remain so designated for
a period of twenty (20) years. A landowner wishing to end an approved APA
designation must notify the Board of County commissioners in writing of their
desire not to renew the land's APA designation before their land designation
expires. Removal will occur upon the expiration of the current twenty (20) year
designation period or ten (10) years from the written request for removal,
whichever is sooner. Failure of the landowner to request removal, will result
in the APA designation automatically renewing for another twenty (20) years.
The clerk of the board of county commissioners shall record the renewal of an
agricultural protection area pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-9707.
As a courtesy, Canyon County DSD may send written notice approximately fifteen
(15) months prior to the deadline for automatic renewal as a reminder of the
date. Failure of DSD to send notice or a landowner's claim of not receiving
notice from DSD will not be a defense to the automatic renewal under Idaho Code
67-9708. (Ord. 25-006, 4-18-2025)
07-09-15: FEES:

07-10-23: CITY IMPACT AREAS:
Within adopted City Impact Areas, the applicable city's setback and height
requirements may be applied. Combinations of County setbacks and heights and
city setbacks and heights are not allowed. (Ord. 10-006, 8-16-2010)
07-10-25: PURPOSES OF ZONES:
   (1)   The purposes of the A (Agricultural) Zone are to:
      A.    Promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of the
County by encouraging the protection of viable farmland and farming operations;
      B.    Limit urban density development to Areas of City Impact in
accordance with the comprehensive plan;
      C.    Protect fish, wildlife, and recreation resources, consistent with
the purposes of the "Local Land Use Planning Act", Idaho Code title 67, chapter
65;
      D.    Protect agricultural land uses, and rangeland uses, and wildlife
management areas from unreasonable adverse impacts from development; and
      E.    Provide for the development of schools, churches, and other public
and quasi-public uses consistent with the comprehensive plan.
   (2)   The purpose of the R-R (Rural Residential) Zone is to encourage and
guide growth in areas where a rural lifestyle may be determined to be suitable.
   (3)   The purpose of the R-1 (Single-Family Residential) Zone is to promote
and enhance predominantly single-family living areas at a low density standard.
   (4)   The purpose of the R-2 (Combined Medium-Density Residential) Zone is
to provide medium-density residential development areas. Medium-density
development concentrations should have a full range of community services and
facilities available or projected for establishment.
   (5)   The purpose of the C-1 (Neighborhood Commercial) Zone is to provide
for local commercial service needs and to restrict incompatible uses.
   (6)   The purpose of the C-2 (Service Commercial) Zone is to provide areas
where activities of a service nature, which are more intensive in character
than in other Commercial Zones, may be carried out.
   (7)   The purpose of the M-1 (Light Industrial) Zone is to provide for and
encourage the grouping together of light industrial uses capable of being
operated under such standards as to location and appearance of buildings and
the treatment of the land about them so that they will be unobtrusive and not
detrimental to surrounding commercial or residential uses.
   (8)   The purpose of the M-2 (Heavy Industrial) Zone is to encourage
industries to locate in and provide for suitable areas in which heavy
industrial uses may be established, substantially free from residential, light
industrial or commercial activities which could interfere with heavy industrial
development and operations.
   (9)   The purpose of the MU-A (Mixed Use - Arterial) Zone is to encourage a
mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses along principal arterials
within Areas of City Impact which are designed in accord with adopted access
management standards for State highways or arterials under the control of a
local highway agency. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)
07-10-27: LAND USE REGULATIONS (MATRIX):

07-10A-01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   (1)   Statutory Authority: The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant
to Idaho Code section 46-1020 through section 46-1024, authorized local
government to adopt Floodplain Management Ordinances that identify floodplains
and minimum floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and
protect human life, health, and property. Therefore, the Board of County
Commissioners of Canyon County, Idaho does hereby ordain as follows.
   (2)   Findings Of Fact:
      A.    The flood hazard areas of Canyon County are subject to periodic
inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      B.    These flood losses are caused by development in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      C.    Local government units have the primary responsibility for
planning, adopting and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management.
   (3)   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this article is to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      A.    Protect human life, health, and property;
      B.    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      C.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      D.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      E.    Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      F.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      G.    Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      H.    Ensure those who occupy the areas of the special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (4)   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to
accomplish its purpose, this article includes methods and provisions to:
      A.    Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      B.    Restrict or prohibit developments which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood
heights, velocities, or erosion;
      C.    Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      D.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
      E.    Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 19-038,

07-10A-03: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall
be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this article its most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: See section
07-02-03: of this chapter.
APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation
of provisions of this article or request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH Zone on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual chance of
flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevation of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of structure.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as hazardous materials facility,
power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment plant.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum
currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for measuring heights is
the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials. Pursuant to Idaho Code sections 46-1021; 46-1022
"development" specifically including the construction of berms, dikes and
levees and does not include the operation, cleaning, maintenance or repair of
any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or
drainage works that is performed or authorized by the owner thereof pursuant to
lawful rights and obligations. Note: Should the State alter or repeal any
portion of this definition or should a court of competent jurisdiction decide
that any portion of this definition is unlawful or invalid, such decision shall
only affect those specific sections and the remaining portions of the
definition shall remain in full force and effect.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as; the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM): The digital official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: An administrative tool of the NFIP that is used to
provide elevation information, to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; and it may be used to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment
(LOMA) or Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision where the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the
original floodplain management regulations adopted by the community, June 17,
1975.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. May also
be referred to as "existing construction".
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the national flood insurance program.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special flood hazard
areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has
been made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map
(DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): An examination, evaluation, and determination of
flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations; or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source;
   (3)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as
defined in subsection (2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid
and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is
carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current; or
   (4)   The collapse of subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in this definition.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that
reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area, and applicable insurance
rate.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this article, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation (BFE) plus the
freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE). Freeboard shall be
one foot (1').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register.
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district.
   (3)   Individually listed on a State Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or
   (4)   Individually listed on a Local Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
A. By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior,
or
B. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FIRMs that can be accomplished by letter. They
include:
   (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to
an effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
ground above the base flood elevation.
   (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMR's are generally based on the
implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic
characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the
existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or
the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report,
and when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is
generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM
or FIS report.
   (3)   Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of
the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
The LOMR-F does not change the FIRM or FIS report.
   (4)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project
complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to
delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon
submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building
permits and/or flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR,
because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this
article.
MANUFACTURED HOME: See definition in section
07-02-03: of this chapter.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is in progress,
and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the mudflow, and
not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program created
by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced Building and Zoning Ordinance and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. Any construction started after September 28,
1984 and before the effective start date of this article is subject to the
ordinance in effect at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of
construction was within one hundred eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before September 28, 1984, the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   (1)   Built on a single chassis, and
   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel and seasonal use.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
10-year period since 1978.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units
or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects
the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBDIVISION: See section
07-02-03: of this chapter.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See
definition of "substantial improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-
related damage sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications,
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
article.
TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Floodplain Administrator from a requirement
of the Flood Hazard Overlay Zone.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required within 44 CFR
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourses
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)

   (1)   Designation Of Floodplain Ordinance Administrator: The Director of
Development Services, or designee, hereinafter referred to as the "Floodplain
Administrator", is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions
of this article. (Based on comments from FEMA Region 10.)
   (2)   Duties: The Floodplain Administrator shall perform, but not be limited
to, the following duties:
      A.    Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits
for all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that
the requirements of this article have been satisfied.
      B.    Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas
to assure that all necessary local, State and Federal permits have been
received, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
      C.    Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification by means of a LOMC to the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA).
      D.    Assure by means of a hydraulic and hydrology analysis that the
flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.
      E.    Prevent encroachments into floodways unless the certification and
flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection 07-10A-11(4) of this article
are met.
      F.    Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of
all new and substantially improved structures, in accordance with the
provisions of subsection 07-10A-09(3) of this article.
      G.    Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which all new and substantially improved structures and utilities
have been floodproofed, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 07-10A-
09(3) of this article.
      H.    Review plans to verify public utilities are constructed in
accordance with the provisions of subsections 07-10A-11(1)E through (1)G of
this article.
      I.    When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
and maintain certifications from a registered professional engineer or
architect in accordance with the provisions of subsections 07-10A-09(3)B and
07-10A-11(2)B of this article.
      J.    Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, and floodways (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity through
application of a LOMC from FEMA to appeal the interpretation as provided in
this article.
      K.    When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 07-10A-05(2) of this article,
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data, along with floodway data
available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed
pursuant to subsection 07-10A-11(3)A2 of this article, in order to administer
the provisions of this article.
      L.    When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of subsection 07-10A-
05(2) of this article, require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zone AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
      M.    Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this article and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      N.    As the work pursuant to a floodplain development permit progresses,
the Floodplain Administrator may make as many inspections of the work as may be
necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of
the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the
Floodplain Administrator has a right, upon presentation of the proper
credentials, to enter on any premises within the jurisdiction of the community
at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement
action. The stop-work order shall constitute a request for voluntary compliance
under section
07-19-01: of this chapter provided the stop-work-order is in substantial
compliance with the form and procedure for a voluntary request for compliance
required by that section.
      O.    The Floodplain Administrator may revoke and require the return of
the floodplain development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing
stating the reason(s) for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any
substantial departure from the approved application, plans, and specifications;
for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of State or local laws;
or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any
floodplain development permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable
State or local law may also be revoked.
      P.    Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his or her Inspections Department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      Q.    Administer requests for variances in compliance with section 07-
10A-13 of this article.
      R.    Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to,
the FIS Report, FIRM and other official flood maps, and studies adopted in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 07-10A-05(2) of this article,
including any revisions thereto including Letters of Map Change, issued by
FEMA. Notify the NFIP State Coordinator and FEMA of your community's mapping
needs.
      S.    Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including Letters of
Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-Fs) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs).
      T.    A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA) of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance
with volume 44 Code of Federal Regulations section 65.3. Such a submission is
necessary to that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting
flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements
will be based upon current data.
      U.    Upon occurrence, notify the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA)
in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that FIRMs accurately represent the community's boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for
which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)

07-10A-11: PROVISIONS FOR FLOODPLAIN HAZARD REDUCTION:
   (1)   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
provisions are required:
      A.    All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      B.    All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
      C.    All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      D.    All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      E.    All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      F.    All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      G.    On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      H.    A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor used solely for parking,
access, and storage shall:
         1.    Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         2.    Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, and AO, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (A)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (B) The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one

containers which could result in the escape of toxic materials into
floodwaters.
      L.    Critical Facilities: Applications for the construction of a
critical facility shall include a statement from a licensed engineer specifying
the design flood event and base flood elevations.
   (3)   Standards For Floodplains Without Established Base Flood Elevations:
Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Zone A (also known as
unnumbered A Zones) and established in subsection 07-10A-05(2) of this article,
where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the
following provisions, in addition to the provisions of subsection (1) of this
section, shall apply:
      A.    The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE)
shall be determined based on the following criteria:
         1.    When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this article and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in subsections (1) and
(2) of this section.
         2.    When floodway data is available from a Federal, State or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements with the floodway
areas shall also comply with the requirements of subsections (2) and (4) of
this section.
         3.    Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for subdivisions greater than 50 lots or 5
acres, whichever is the lesser), include within such proposals base flood
elevation data. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by
reference in accordance with subsection 07-10A-05(2) of this article and
utilized in implementing this article.
         4.    When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
Federal, State or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non-residential) to two feet (2') above the highest
adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection elevation
(FPE) whichever is higher, as defined in section 07-10A-03 of this article. All
other applicable provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall also apply.
   (4)   Standards For Floodways: Areas designated as floodways located within
the special flood hazard areas established in subsection 07-10A-05(2) of this
article. The floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of
floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential
projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in
subsections (1) and (2) of this section, shall apply to all development within
such areas:
      A.    No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         1.    It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practices and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         2.    A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6)
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
      B.    If subsection (4)A of this section is satisfied, all development
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
article.
      C.    Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
         1.    The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (2)D of
this section; and
         2.    The encroachment standards of subsection (4)A of this section.
   (5)   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO And AH): Areas
designated as shallow flooding areas have special flood hazards associated with
base flood depths of one foot (1') to three feet (3') where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate. In addition to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following
requirements:
      A.    The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of one foot (1'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. A
minimum of two feet (2') is required and four feet (4') is recommended where a
depth is not provided.
      B.    Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection (5)A of this section
so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required in accordance with subsection 07-10A-09(3) of this
article, and subsection (2)B of this section.
      C.    Accessory structure (sheds, detached garages, etc.):
         1.    Used solely for parking, access, and storage:
            (A) Shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of one foot (1'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least two
feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. A
minimum of two feet (2') is required and four feet (4') is recommended where a
depth is not provided; or
            (B) Shall have flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization
of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below Flood Protection Elevation
in conformance with the provisions of subsection (1)H of this section.
         2.    Not used solely for parking, access, and storage:
            (A) Shall be elevated per subsections (2)A and (2)B of this
section.
      D.    Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 19-
038, 8-30-2019)

criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   (2)   Issuance: Variances shall only be issued:
      A.    Upon a determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
      B.    For the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure;
      C.    Upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
      D.    Upon showing of good and sufficient cause;
      E.    Upon determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      F.    Upon showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity of water. This includes
only facilities defined in section 07-10A-03 of this article in the definition
of "functionally dependent use".
   (3)   Variance Criteria:
      A.    In considering variance applications, Canyon County shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this article, and:
         1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;

flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      B.    Variances shall not be issued within any floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (4)   Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance
shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and
denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice
along with the written decision that the permitted development will have its
lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk. The
Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)

AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
07-10B-01: Purpose
07-10B-03: Uses Allowed And Permitted
07-10B-05: Conflict
07-10B-07: Other Considerations
07-10B-09: Nonliability Clause
07-10B-01: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the AP (Airport Overlay) Zone is to provide zoning protection to
the present and long term use of airports and airport facilities. Uses within
the AP Zone are generally associated with airport related activities, open
space and agricultural uses which are harmonious with the use of airports. The
AP Zone is superimposed over other zones. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)
07-10B-03: USES ALLOWED AND PERMITTED:
   (1)   A use is allowed or permitted within the AP Zone only by approval of
the commission after a hearing held pursuant to the conditional use permit
procedure as set forth in article 7 of this chapter.
   (2)   All uses allowed and all uses permitted by conditional use permit in
the respective zone over which the AP Zone is superimposed are appropriate, but
uses of airports and airport related facilities such as radio facilities,
directional aids to navigation and other structures or facilities as may be
determined to be essential to air navigation and operation, agriculture uses,
structures used for the habitation of people, and those uses, operations or
structures where people might congregate or meet may be approved by the
commission only following the conditional use permit procedure. The commission
shall not permit a use which would conflict with the airport presently or in
the future, unless the conflict can be avoided by imposition of special
conditions.
   (3)   Utility distribution facilities not in violation of any applicable
Federal airport standard or regulation applicable to the airport. (Ord. 19-038,
8-30-2019)
07-10B-05: CONFLICT:
If any of the regulations specified in article 10A, "Flood Hazard Overlay
Zone", of this chapter differ from regulations in this article, then the
regulations of article 10A, "Flood Hazard Overlay Zone", of this chapter shall
govern. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)
07-10B-07: OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
   (1)   In evaluating a proposed land use, the presiding party shall consider
the following:
      A.    Evaluation of the effect of a proposed use on airport facilities
will be made based not only on a single use acting alone but upon the
reasonable assumption that other landowners within the AP (Airport Overlay)
Zone may need or desire to establish similar land uses. As such, accumulative
effects will be considered in making decisions.
      B.    Different construction material and methods may be required for
sound control purpose beyond those normally required to avoid adverse effects
from noise.
      C.    Auditoriums, churches, schools, hospitals, theaters, and other uses
where congregations of people are common, shall be avoided whenever possible.
      D.    Criteria related to the established noise contours for the airport
shall be used in considering conditional use permit applications.
      E.    Criteria related to Federal Aviation Administration Regulations
shall be used in considering conditional use permit applications.
      F.    Input from government entities. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)
07-10B-09: NONLIABILITY CLAUSE:
   (1)   The granting of a conditional use permit for a use in the AP Zone
shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind or
nature by the commission or the Board or by any office or employee thereof of
the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no
liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer or employee
for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. (Ord. 19-038, 8-30-2019)

property, the owner or applicant shall submit documents to the Director proving
the following:
      A.    The property was in compliance with the minimum property size
requirement of the applicable zoning district prior to the decrease in property
size; and
      B.    The decrease in property size was caused by acquisition through
prescription, purchase, or other means by Canyon County, a municipality within
Canyon County, a highway district within Canyon County, Idaho Transportation
Department, utility company or corporation under the jurisdiction of the Idaho

expansion or replacement of the structure (or portions thereof) dedicated to
the nonconforming use; anything beyond regular maintenance and minor repairs
(as required by the Canyon County Building Code as set forth in chapter 6 of
this Code); and any action that extends the duration of the nonconforming use.
   (3)   If a nonconforming use has ceased for ten (10) years or has been
replaced with a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned
and shall not be reestablished. If nonuse or vacancy continues for a period of
a year or longer, the County may request resolution of the nonconforming use
right according to procedures outlined in Idaho Code section 67-6538(2) as it
may be amended or retitled from time to time.
   (4)   A nonconforming use or structure housing a nonconforming use that is
damaged more than fifty percent (50%) of its current assessed taxable value by
fire, flood, explosion, wind, earthquake, war, riot, calamity, or other
catastrophic event, shall comply with this chapter upon reconstruction. If the
damage to the nonconforming use or structure housing the nonconforming use is
fifty percent (50%) or less of the current assessed taxable value, the
nonconforming use may continue, provided that the nonconforming use commences
within ten (10) years of the event. If nonuse or vacancy continues for a period
of a year or longer, the County may request resolution of the nonconforming use
right according to procedures outlined in Idaho Code section 67-6538(2) as it

the CAFO siting permit application. The commission may authorize a variance
from the requirements contained in this article not in conflict with the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this article would result in undue hardship to the applicant. The

required variance fee as set by the board by resolution at the time of
submitting his or her application. (Ord. 07-002, 1-18-2007)

set forth in this article, the commission shall grant the CAFO siting permit
requested. The CAFO siting permit shall be in the form of findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order. If the commission does not find that the
applicant has shown that the proposed expanding or new CAFO meets the criteria
set forth herein, the commission shall deny the CAFO siting permit in writing
setting forth reasons for the denial and the relevant law relied upon and
action that may be taken by the applicant to attempt to obtain a conditional

(3) years of the issuance of the CAFO siting permit and be completed within
five (5) years of the same date. If construction has not commenced within three
(3) years and/or completed within five (5) years from the date the CAFO siting
permit was approved, the permit holder may request an extension. Application
for extension must be filed at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of

persuasion on an extension request. (Ord. 07-002, 1-18-2007)
08-01-15: PROCESS FOR CAFO SITING PERMIT:
   (1)   If the CAFO siting permit holder desires to make changes to the
conditions of the CAFO siting permit that result in material changes to the
project, an amended conditional use permit is required. The commission, after
notice and hearing as required for an original application, and if necessary
after submission of additional information, shall apply the same criteria as
for granting an original application. If the change request is granted by the
commission, an amended CAFO siting permit shall be issued within ten (10) days
of commission approval.

permit holder may appeal the denial to the board. The appeals shall be governed
and processed in accordance with the provisions of the CCZO 05-002, as amended.
   (3)   Inspection of the construction progress of the CAFO facility
authorized by the CAFO siting permit shall occur as governed by the current
international building code adopted by the board. For those sections for which
a building code inspection is not required, inspections, if requested by the
department, shall be performed by the appropriate agency having jurisdiction
and reported to the director.
   (4)   The director shall have the authority to issue a "stop work" order for
that portion of the new or expanding facility in violation of the CAFO siting
permit if an inspection reveals a material violation of the terms of the CAFO
siting permit or construction that does not comply with the CAFO plans as
presented. All work specified in the order shall stop after posting the order.
The CAFO siting permit holder owner may appeal such an order to the commission
by filing an application approved by the department and paying the filing fee
approved by the board by resolution.
   (5)   A CAFO operator may initiate operation of a new or expanded facility
prior to completion of the project, provided that they have the necessary
operation and nutrient management plan in place and provided that their waste
management facility has passed final inspection by ISDA, or the appropriate
state/federal agency having jurisdiction.
   (6)   After completion of the construction of the new or expanding CAFO
authorized by the CAFO siting permit and completion of any approved change
requests or department required compliance corrections, the applicant shall
provide written proof to the director that all required permits have been
obtained and the nutrient management plan approved where a responsible
regulatory agency requires approval of that plan. The applicant shall provide
copies of all permits and the nutrient management plan for the CAFO to the
director. The director shall certify that the new or expanding CAFO has been
inspected and conforms to the terms of the CAFO siting permit, with approved
changes, and the CAFO siting permit holder is fully authorized to operate the
new or expanded CAFO.
   (7)   The board may also, at any time, take immediate action to protect the
public from immediate danger in accordance with the process set forth in CCZO
and the local land use planning act, as amended. (Ord. 07-002, 1-18-2007)

include a statement of the reasons for the appeal and must be accompanied by a

if it were a hearing originating before the board. (Ord. 07-002, 1-18-2007)
08-01-17: PENALTIES, ENFORCEMENT AND PERMIT REVOCATION:
   (1)   Penalties: Each violation of this article is a misdemeanor. Each day
that work or land use continues after notification of violation shall
constitute a separate offense, and each violation shall be punishable as
provided in Idaho Code section 18-113, as amended.
   (2)   Enforcement Procedures:
      A.    Whenever DSD shall determine that a probable violation of this
article has occurred or is about to occur, it shall notify the board of such
probable violation and recommend action that should be taken. Upon knowledge of
probable violation, whether or not a recommendation has been received from the
director or the commission, the board may request that the Canyon County
prosecuting attorney investigate, and if appropriate, commence action, criminal
or civil, to correct the violation and to punish the same.
      B.    In the event any use of land or any construction commences in
violation of the provisions of this article, the proper authorities of the
county, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or
proceedings to prevent such unlawful use of land or construction, to restrain,
correct or abate such violation or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
construction, business or use of land in or about such premises.
   (3)   CAFO Permit Revocation Procedures: Violation of this article, or any
conditions of an approved CAFO siting permit, will cause the owner/operator to
be in violation of this article and will cause the CAFO siting permit to be
revoked. The violation may cause the revocation of the CAFO siting permit by
the county in accordance with the following notice and hearing procedures:
      A.    If any person, including staff or a member of the commission, files
a written notice presenting sufficient evidence, as determined by the director,
alleging that the conditions of the conditional use permit have been violated,
the final presiding party, the board or the commission, whichever made the
final decision, shall set the matter for a public hearing noticed in accordance
with subsection (3)B of this section.
      B.    The commission or the board shall conduct at least one public
hearing on the proposed revocation of an approved CAFO siting permit for a new
CAFO or a CAFO siting permit for an expanding CAFO in which interested persons
shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen (15) calendar days
prior to the hearing, notice of the time and place and a summary of the
proposal shall be published in the official newspaper or newspaper of general

08-01-18: LAWFULLY CONDUCTED OPERATIONS:
It is the policy of Canyon County that no person shall be allowed to challenge
lawfully conducted agricultural operations whether such operations result in
inconvenience to other nonagricultural residences or users in an agricultural
zone. Therefore, no person shall challenge such lawfully conducted agricultural
operations, including, but not limited to, the operation of dairies, feedlots,
CAFOs, aerial spraying, nighttime activities associated with planting, harvest,
or cultivation, and whether such activities result in noise, dust, insects,
slow traffic, or otherwise cause inconvenience to surrounding property owners
where such agricultural activities are being conducted or approved when such
person takes occupancy of such other nonagricultural use, including residence.

permit is required, then at the time that construction commences; or
      C.   At such other time as the fee payer or developer and the County have
agreed upon in writing.
   (2)   Enforcement: When any impact fee is due pursuant to this chapter, or
pursuant to the terms of any written agreement between a fee payer and the
County, and such impact fee has not been paid in a timely manner, the County
may exercise any or all of the following powers as applicable to its authority,
in any combination, to enforce the collection of the impact fee:
      A.   Withhold building permits, manufactured home installation permits,
or other County development approval related to the development for which the
impact fee is due until all impact fees due have been paid, and issue stop work

for failure to timely pay an impact fee following the procedures contained in
Idaho Code title 45, chapter 5. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-13: CERTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT:
   (1)   A fee payer may request a written certification of the impact fee
schedule or individual assessment which shall establish the impact fee for that

individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule. A certification
may be applied for in the following manner:
      A.   Requests for certification shall be in writing and made to the
County and impact fee administrator. Within thirty (30) days after receiving
such request, the impact fee administrator shall issue a written certification
of the amount of the impact fee due for the proposed development. The
certification shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee
including an explanation of factors considered under Idaho Code § 67-8207 and
shall also specify the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is
intended to be used. The impact fee administrator shall provide the
certification to the fee payer and the County. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-15: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT:
   (1)   In lieu of calculating the amount of the development impact fee using
the impact fee schedules in this chapter, an individual assessment of impact
fees is permitted.
      A.   Individual Assessment Process: A fee payer may file a written
request for an individual assessment of the development prior to the receipt of
a building permit or other necessary approvals or entitlements from Canyon
County. A request for an individual assessment process shall involve
consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by
the fee payer to adjust the amount of the impact fee.
         1.   Each individual assessment request and supporting documentation
submitted by the fee payer shall be based on the same level of service
standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the applicable capital
improvements plan, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost) methodology,
and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions used.
         2.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the County may
then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications as the basis for
calculating the impact fee. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or
acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual assessment is a
more accurate measure of demand for system improvements element(s) created by
the proposed development, or the costs of those facilities, than the applicable
fee shown in the fee schedule, based on the standards in § 67-8207, Idaho Code.
         3.   The impact fee administrator shall issue a written decision
within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed request for individual
assessment together with all supporting information from the fee payer, so as
not to unreasonably delay the developer's (fee payer's) subsequent applications
to the County for building permits.
         4.   The decision on an application for an individual assessment shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee, shall specify the
system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of those factors identified in Idaho Code § 67-
8207. The impact fee administrator shall provide notice of final determination
of an individual assessment to the fee payer and County.
         5.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by the County then the impact fee due under this chapter for such
development shall be calculated according to such individual assessment. (Ord.
20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-17: DEVELOPER CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENT:
Credits or reimbursements due to a fee payer pursuant to this section must be
based upon a written agreement with the County and impact fee recipient
negotiated in good faith, prior to the construction, funding or contribution
made by the fee payer which written agreement shall provide for the amount of
credit or the amount, time and form of reimbursement. Subject to this written
agreement, a fee payer shall receive credit or reimbursement for the present
value of any system improvement, the value of dedication of real property to
the impact fee recipient, or other contribution required by the County and
impact fee recipient from the developer for system improvements of the category
for which the impact fee is being collected, including system improvements paid
for pursuant to a local improvement district.
   (1)   Limitations: All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be
subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this
chapter:
      A.   No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or
construction of project improvements or site related facilities.
      B.   A fee payer shall not receive an offset or credit in excess of that
amount to be collected from the assessed impact fee.
      C.   The unit costs used to calculate the offsets or credits shall not
exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the CIP(s) for
the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is
imposed.
      D.   An offset or credit shall lapse ten (10) years after receipt of the
first building permit issued after the effective date of this chapter or within
such period as may be otherwise agreed to by written agreement.
      E.   The County will not reimburse the property owner or fee payer for an
offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected
pursuant to this chapter or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due
for the new development for the category of capital improvement.
      F.   The amount of any offset or credit shall not include the amount
attributable to participation by the County in the development.
   (2)   Application: An offset or credit associated with a plat shall be
applied to an impact fee at the time of application for the first building
permit for the subject property and will continue to be applied until the
offset or credit is exhausted for that development. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-19: METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
   (1)   General Provisions:
      A.   Accounting Principles: The calculation of a development impact fee
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee
may result in an incidental benefit to owners or developers within the service
area other than the fee payer.
      B.   Levels Of Service: The impact fee shall be calculated on the basis
of levels of service for public facilities in the applicable adopted capital
improvement plan that are applicable to existing development as well as new
growth and development. The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement
of new or existing public facilities for which the impact fee is imposed shall
be attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new development.
   (2)   Methodology; Proportionate Methodology: The impact fee shall not
exceed a proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements determined
in accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8207, as it may be amended. Impact fees
shall be based on actual system improvements costs or reasonable estimates of
such costs. The amount of the impact fee shall be calculated using the
methodology contained in the adopted capital improvements plan.
   (3)   Proportionate Share Determination:
      A.   The impact fee shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula or
method under which the impact fee imposed does not exceed a proportionate share
of the costs incurred or to be incurred in the provision of system improvements
to serve the new development. The proportionate share is the costs attributable
to the new development after considering the following:
         1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money,
dedication of land or construction of system improvements;
         2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
         3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated to system
improvements; and
         4.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
      B.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the fee payer, the following factors shall be
considered and accounted for in the calculation of the impact fee:
         1.   The costs of existing system improvements within the service
area;
         2.   The means by which existing system improvements have been
financed;
         3.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to system
improvements costs through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to system improvements costs
through fee payer contributions;
         4.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
         5.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area;
         6.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
         7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         8.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-21: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT:
   (1)   Board's development service director may make a preliminary
determination of extraordinary impact during local land use planning act
proceedings, chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, or prior to the issuance of a
building permit. The County shall notify the impact fee administrator of such
determination and the impact fee administrator shall review and determine
whether or not a development application will impose extraordinary impact.
   (2)   Within thirty (30) days after impact fee administrator's receipt from
the County of the development application, the impact fee administrator will
notify the fee payer and the County of the impact fee administrator's initial
determination that the development may impose an extraordinary impact. Such
notice shall include that a supplemental study, at the fee payer's expense will
be required.
   (3)   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a development
with extraordinary impact, the impact fee administrator shall meet with the fee
payer to discuss whether the fee payer wants to: (a) pay for the supplemental
study necessary to determine the system improvements costs related to the
proposed development; (b) modify the proposal to avoid generating extraordinary
impact; or (c) withdraw the application for certification, or development
approval.
   (4)   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed development's proportionate share of system improvements
costs, then the impact fee administrator and the fee payer shall jointly select
an individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The fee
payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the fee payer agrees to a longer time.
   (5)   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to: (a)
pay the proportionate share of system improvements costs documented by the
supplemental study; or (b) modify the proposed development to reduce such
costs; or (c) withdraw the application. The impact fee administrator shall
notify the County of the fee payer's choice within fifteen (15) days of the fee
payer's decision.
   (6)   If the fee payer agrees to pay the system improvements costs
documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to
writing between the County, impact fee recipient, and the fee payer prior to
review and consideration of any application for any development approval or
building permit related to the proposed development.
   (7)   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the
proportionate share of system improvements costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this chapter shall obligate the County to approve development
that results in an extraordinary impact. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-23: FEE PAYER REFUNDS:
   (1)   Duty To Refund:
      A.   An impact fee shall be refunded to a fee payer, or successor in
interest, in the following circumstances:

that the fee paid exceeded the fee payer's proportionate share;
         4.   The impact fee is collected and the impact fee was not
appropriated or expended pursuant to the act.
      B.   Any impact fee paid shall be refunded if the system improvements in
accordance with this chapter have not commenced construction, or funds
appropriated for such construction, within eight (8) years after the date on
which such fee was collected. Any refund due shall be paid to the owner of
record of the parcel for which the impact fee was paid. Impact fees may be held
for longer than eight (8) years but in no event longer than eleven (11) years
from the date collected if it is identified in writing: (a) a reasonable cause
why the fees should be held longer than eight (8) years; and (b) an anticipated
date by which the fees will be expended. In this event the impact fees so
identified shall be refunded in accordance with the written statement if
construction has not commenced, or funds are not appropriated for such
construction, on or before the date identified in such writing.
      C.   After an impact fee has been paid pursuant to this chapter and after
a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the County, no refund of any part
of such fee shall be made if the project for which the fee was paid is later
demolished, destroyed, or is altered, reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to
reduce the size of the project or the number of units in the project.
      D.   Each refund shall include a refund of interest at one-half (½) the
legal rate provided for in Idaho Code § 28-22-104 from the date on which the
fee was originally paid.

whether a refund is due within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written
request for a refund from the fee payer, successor in interest, or an owner of
record of the property for which the fee was paid. When the right to a refund
exists, the refund shall be made within ninety (90) days after the
determination that a refund is due. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-25: EXPENDITURE OF IMPACT FEES:
Expenditures of impact fees collected under this chapter, including interest
earned, shall be made only for system improvements and either within or for the
benefit of the service area for which the impact fee was collected in
accordance with the capital improvements plan and as authorized by the Idaho
development impact fee act. Impact fees shall not be used for any purpose other
than system improvement costs to create additional improvements to serve new
growth. A portion of each impact fee collected may be designated as a surcharge
for reimbursement for the cost of preparing the capital improvements plan in
accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8208. The surcharge shall not exceed the
development's proportionate share of the cost of preparing the capital
improvements plan. (Ord. 20-018, 6-22-2020)
11-01-27: APPEALS, PROTEST AND MEDIATION:

11-03-13: CERTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT:
   (1)   Fee Payer may request a written certification of the Impact Fee
Schedule or individual assessment which shall establish the impact fee for that
Development. Such certification shall establish the Impact Fee so long as there
is no material change to the particular Development as identified in the
individual assessment application, or the impact fee schedule. A certification
may be applied for in the following manner:
      A.   Requests for certification shall be in writing and made to CHD4
Impact Fee Administrator. Within thirty (30) days after receiving such request,
the Impact Fee Administrator shall issue a written certification of the amount
of the Impact Fee due for the proposed Development. The certification shall

   (1)   In lieu of calculating the amount of the Development Impact Fee using
the impact fee schedules in this chapter, an individual assessment of Impact
Fees is permitted.
      A.   Individual Assessment Process. A Fee Payer may file a written
request for an individual assessment of the Development prior to the receipt of
a building permit or other necessary approvals or entitlements from Canyon

consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by
the Fee Payer to adjust the amount of the Impact Fee.
         1.   Each individual assessment request and supporting documentation
submitted by the Fee Payer shall be based on the same level of service
standards and unit costs for System Improvements used in the applicable Capital
Improvements Plan, shall use an average cost (not a marginal cost) methodology,
and shall document the relevant methodologies and assumptions used.
         2.   Each individual assessment request delivered to CHD4 may then be
accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by the Impact Fee
Administrator as the basis for calculating the Impact Fee. The criteria for
acceptance, rejection or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the
individual assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for System
Improvements element(s) created by the proposed Development, or the costs of
those facilities, than the applicable fee shown in the fee schedule, based on
the standards in Section 67-8207, Idaho Code.
         3.   The Impact Fee Administrator shall issue a written decision
within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed request for individual
assessment together with all supporting information from the Fee Payer, so as
not to unreasonably delay the Developer's (Fee Payer's) subsequent applications
to the County for Building Permits.
         4.   The decision on an application for an individual assessment shall
include an explanation of the calculation of the Impact Fee, shall specify the
System Improvement(s) for which the Impact Fee is intended to be used, and
shall include an explanation of those factors identified in Idaho Code § 67-
8207. The Impact Fee Administrator shall provide notice of final determination
of an individual assessment to the Fee Payer and County.
         5.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with
modifications by CHD4 then the Impact Fee due under this chapter for such
Development shall be calculated according to such individual assessment.

11-03-17: DEVELOPER CREDITS AND REIMBURSEMENT:
Credits or reimbursements due to a Fee Payer pursuant to this section must be
based upon a written agreement with CHD4 and Impact Fee Recipient negotiated in
good faith with the Impact Fee Administrator, prior to the construction,
funding or contribution made by the Fee Payer which written agreement shall
provide for the amount of credit or the amount, time and form of reimbursement.
Subject to this written agreement, a fee payer shall receive credit or
reimbursement for the present value of any system improvement, the value of
dedication of real property to the Impact Fee Recipient, or other contribution
required by CHD4 and Impact Fee Recipient from the developer for system
improvements of the category for which the impact fee is being collected,
including system improvements paid for pursuant to a local improvement
district.
   (1)   Limitations: All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be
subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this
chapter:
      A.   No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or
construction of project improvements or site related facilities.
      B.   A fee payer shall not receive an offset or credit in excess of that
amount to be collected from the assessed impact fee.
      C.   The unit costs used to calculate the offsets or credits shall not
exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the CIP(s) for
the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is
imposed.
      D.   An offset or credit shall lapse ten (10) years after receipt of the
first building permit issued after the effective date of this chapter or within
such period as may be otherwise agreed to by written agreement.
      E.   CHD4 will not reimburse the property owner or fee payer for an
offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected
pursuant to this chapter or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due
for the new development for the category of capital improvement.
      F.   The amount of any offset or credit shall not include the amount
attributable to participation by CHD4 in the development.
   (2)   Application: An offset or credit associated with a plat shall be
applied to an impact fee at the time of application for the first building
permit for the subject property and will continue to be applied until the
offset or credit is exhausted for that development.
(Ord. 22-014, 7-20-2022)
11-03-19: METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES:
   (1)   General Provisions.
      A.   Accounting Principles. The calculation of a Development Impact Fee
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee
may result in an incidental benefit to owners or Developers within the service
area other than the Fee Payer.
      B.   Levels of Service. The Impact Fee shall be calculated on the basis
of levels of service for Public Facilities in the applicable adopted Capital
Improvements Plan that are applicable to existing Development as well as new
growth and Development. The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement
of new or existing Public Facilities for which the Impact Fee is imposed shall
be attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new Development.
   (2)   Methodology: Proportionate Methodology. The Impact Fee shall not
exceed a proportionate share of the cost of the System Improvements determined
in accordance with Idaho Code § 67-8207, as it may be amended. Impact Fees
shall be based on actual System Improvements Costs or reasonable estimates of
such costs. The amount of the Impact Fee shall be calculated using the
methodology contained in the adopted Capital Improvements Plan.
   (3)   Proportionate Share Determination.
      A.   The Impact Fee shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula or
method under which the Impact Fee imposed does not exceed a proportionate share
of the costs incurred or to be incurred in the provision of System Improvements
to serve the new Development. The proportionate share is the costs attributable
to the new Development after the considering the following:
         1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money,
dedication of land or construction of System Improvements;
         2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
         3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated to System
Improvements; and
         4.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.
      B.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of System
Improvements to be paid by the Fee Payer, the following factors shall be
considered and accounted for in the calculation of the Impact Fee:
         1.   The costs of existing System Improvements within the Service
area;
         2.   The means by which existing System Improvements have been
financed;
         3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements Costs through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements Costs
through Fee Payer contributions;
         4.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing System Improvements in the future;
         5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area;
         6.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development;
         7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation.
(Ord. 22-014, 7-20-2022)
11-03-21: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT:
   (1)   Board's Development Service Director may make a preliminary
determination of Extraordinary Impact during Local Land Use Planning Act
proceedings, chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, or prior to the issuance of a
building permit. The County shall notify the Impact Fee Administrator of such
determination and the Impact Fee Administrator shall review and determine
whether or not a Development application will impose Extraordinary Impact.
   (2)   Within thirty (30) days after Impact Fee Administrator's receipt from
the County of the development application, the Impact Fee Administrator will
notify the Fee Payer and the County of the Impact Fee Administrator's initial
determination that the Development may impose an Extraordinary Impact. Such
notice shall include that a supplemental study, at the Fee Payer's expense will
be required.
   (3)   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a Development
with Extraordinary Impact, the Impact Fee Administrator shall meet with the Fee
Payer to discuss whether the Fee Payer wants to: (a) pay for the supplemental
study necessary to determine the System Improvements Costs related to the
proposed Development; (b) modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary
Impact; or (c) withdraw the application for certification, or Development
approval.
   (4)   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed Development's proportionate share of System Improvements
Costs, then the Impact Fee Administrator and the Fee Payer shall jointly select
an individual or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The Fee
Payer shall enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization
to pay the costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental
study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless
the Fee Payer agrees to a longer time.
   (5)   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to: (a)
pay the proportionate share of System Improvements Costs documented by the
supplemental study; or (b) modify the proposed Development to reduce such
costs; or (c) withdraw the application. The Impact Fee Administrator shall
notify the County of the Fee Payer's choice within fifteen (15) days of the Fee
Payer's decision.
   (6)   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay the System Improvements Costs
documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to
writing between the County, CHD4, Impact Fee Recipient, and the Fee Payer prior
to review and consideration of any application for any Development approval or
Building Permit related to the proposed Development.
   (7)   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the
proportionate share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental
study, nothing in this ordinance shall obligate the County to approve
Development that results in an Extraordinary Impact.

Notes:
   1.   Trip generation data based on local data. Collected by Ada County
Highway District (ACHD) through individual assessment process.          
   2.   Vehicle trips generated by commercial land uses typically have lower
lengths than trips generated by residential or office land-uses. The U.S.
Department of Transportation's Summary of Travel Trends: 2017 National
Household Travel Survey states that the average trip length of shopping trips
and other family/personal errands are approximately 32% shorter than the
average trip lengths for all trips. The COMPASS 2012 Regional Household Travel
Survey states that Home-Based-Shop trips are approximately 59% shorter than
Home-Based-Work trips. Trip reduction factors of 75% (correlates with 25%
decrease), 50%, and 25% were applied to land uses that are expected to have
average trip lengths lower than 11.2 miles. These reduction factors were
applied based on the guidance in the travel surveys and expected development
patterns in the Mid-Star service area. Commercial and office-related
development is expected to be centered on the SH 44 corridor and will result in
trip lengths significantly shorter than trips that require travel external to
the Mid-Star service area.
