(Prior Code, § 1-2-2)
§ 10.07 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Prior acts. No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a

as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act
done, any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatsoever to affect
any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment may be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.

either by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance
making any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   (C)   Currently-pending actions. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the city herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accrued or
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation,
or as waiving any right of the city under any ordinance or provision thereof in
force at the time of the adoption of this code.

distributive words may not have been used. When any subject matter, party, or
person is referred to in this code by words importing the singular number only
or a particular gender, several matters, parties, or persons and the opposite
gender and bodies corporate shall be deemed to be included; provided, these
rules of construction shall not be applied to any section of this code which
contains any express provision excluding such construction or where the subject
matter or context may be repugnant thereto.

changed in the content of this code to “title,” “chapter,” “subchapter,”
“section,” and/or “division,” or words of like-import for organizational and
clarification purposes only. Such change to the city’s ordinances is not meant
to amend passage and effective dates of such original ordinances.

§ 10.09 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, division, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this

shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of
this code or any part thereof. The City Council hereby declares that it would
have passed each section, division, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase
thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, division,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared unconstitutional,
invalid, or ineffective.

the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the building sewer.
   (F)   A separate and independent building sewer connection shall be provided
for every building. Each independent sewer connection (lateral) shall be owned
and maintained by the property owner from the building to the main line and
shall be maintained by the property owner.
   (G)   The city reserves the right to connect any eligible building or
contract for connection at the owner’s expense. Should the owner fail to pay or
contract for payment of such expenses, the city may:
      (1)   File the expenses for reimbursement with the county, to be
collected with property taxes; or
      (2)   Utilize available legal remedies to collect the expenses. Should
the city collect such expenses over time, a reasonable interest rate, to be
established by the City Council resolution, shall be assessed. Extended
delinquency is cause for disconnecting the service, which costs for both
disconnection and reconnection will be billed to the property owner.
   (H)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the city and paid for by the
property owner, to meet all requirements of this subchapter.
   (I)   The size, slope, alignment, and materials of construction of a
building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the
requirements of §§
153.110 through
153.126, or to other applicable rules and regulations of the city. In the
absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the State Plumbing Code
shall apply.
   (J)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to and within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer, in
conformance with §§
153.110 through
153.126.
   (K)   The purpose of sewer lateral replacement program (LRP) inspection and
repair is to decrease the volume of inflow and infiltration (I&I) which enters
the sewers by repairing or replacing private sewer laterals. The program shall
initiate inspections periodically so that the condition of private laterals can
be accurately assessed and repaired or replaced as necessary.
      (1)   For private sewer laterals installed prior to 2015, an owner must
have his or her private sewer lateral inspected by video for defects when any
of the following events occur:
         (a)   A pre-2010 built house or business prior to its sale closing;
         (b)   An owner takes out a building permit for more than $10,000 for a
house or $25,000 for a business which was constructed more than five years
prior;
         (c)   An inspection of a sewer main line is conducted by city sewer
crews or an approved agent who identifies excessive inflow and infiltration
from a private sewer lateral or identifies that private sewer lateral repairs
are needed from the close circuit television (CCTV) inspection in the main
line;
         (d)   No house or business shall be required to have its lateral
inspected more than once every five years. If the city determines that the
lateral is in need of repair, the city will review the video of the lateral
inspection and rate it based on the city’s most current sewer lateral
replacement program. A sewer lateral receiving a rating of 1,000 points or more
would require repair or replacement; and
         (e)   Once a lateral has a failed rating of 1,000 points or more, the
property owner will be notified by the city and the property owner shall repair
the lateral within 90 days. If the lateral has not been repaired after 90 days,
an additional charge, to be established by resolution of the City Council, will
be billed to the owner for noncompliance.
      (2)   Beginning in 2030, an owner who had their private sewer lateral
installed on or after 2015 must have his, her, or their private sewer lateral
inspected by video for defects when any of the following events occur:
         (a)   A house or business is to be sold which was constructed prior to
2010, before the sale closes;
         (b)   An owner takes out a building permit for more than $10,000 for a
house or $25,000 for a business which was constructed more than five years
prior;
         (c)   An inspection of a sewer main line is conducted by city sewer
crews or an approved agent who identifies excessive inflow and infiltration
from a private sewer lateral or identifies that private sewer lateral repairs
are needed from the close circuit television (CCTV) inspection in the main
line;
         (d)   No house or business shall be required to have its lateral
inspected more than once every five years. If the city determines that the
lateral is in need of repair, the city will review the video of the lateral
inspection and rate it based on the city’s most current sewer lateral
replacement program. A sewer lateral receiving a rating of 1,000 points or more
would require repair or replacement; and
         (e)   Once a lateral has a failed rating of 1,000 points or more, the
property owner will be notified by the city and the property owner shall repair
the lateral within 90 days. If the lateral has not been repaired after 90 days,
an additional charge, to be established by resolution of the City Council, will
be billed to the owner for noncompliance.
      (3)   The owner may apply for an extension of up to ten months to
complete repairs. The extension period will begin at the end of the 90-day
period. The fine, to be established by resolution of the City Council, will
continue to accrue during this extension period and will be due in full at the
end of the 10 month extension if work is not completed. All penalty fines
collected will go into the Sewer Repair and Maintenance Fund.
      (4)   Should the owner fail to pay the bill or have his or her lateral
repaired, the city may repair the lateral and file the expenses for
reimbursement with the county, to be collected with property taxes, or utilize
available legal remedies to collect the expenses. Should the city collect such
expenses over time, a reasonable interest rate, to be established by the City
Council resolution, may be assessed. Extended delinquency is cause for
disconnecting the service, which costs for both disconnection and reconnection
will be billed to the property.
   (L)   Existing sump pumps, roof drains, and roof downspouts that currently
discharge to the sanitary sewer system shall be redirected to the storm sewer
system and/or disconnected, mechanically severed, or altered. Replaced
connections shall conform to the standards described in division (B) above.
   (M)   All future connections of sump pumps, roof drains, and roof downspouts
shall be built to the standards described in division (B) above. No person(s)
shall connect sump pumps, roof drains, and roof downspouts for the purpose of
discharging clear waters to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is
connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (N)   The connection of building sewer laterals into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building Code, and specifically §§
153.110 through
153.126, or other applicable rules and regulations of the city, or to the
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the International
Plumbing Code. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any
deviations from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the
city before installation. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall
notify the city when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
city or an authorized representative.
   (O)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall take reasonable
safety measures to protect the public from hazard, following established
industry standards for excavation and installation existing at the time of the
excavation/installation. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city.
   (P)   The city and the South Fork Sewer District (SFSD) have an active
memorandum of understanding, established on March 16, 1978, that explains the
responsibilities of each governing body (Appendix No. 1 on file in the city).
   (Q)   No person shall disconnect any sewage connection without first
notifying the city. After such notification and approval by the city, the
connection may be disconnected and sealed in such a manner so as to prevent the
passage of any liquid, substance, gas, or odor into or out of said sewage line.
Pipe sealing shall be completed using a sewer cap or repair coupling. Sealing
shall not in any way impede the flow of sewage within the sewage main, and
shall be of sufficient thickness, strength, and design to equal the sewage
main. The city shall be notified upon completion of sealing, and any excavation
for such a sealing shall be left open for sufficient time for the city to
inspect the same.

§ 51.04 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (A)   No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated
cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Stormwater and all other drainage shall be discharged to such sewers
as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved
by the city and meeting all appropriate local, state, and federal rules and
regulations. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process water may be
discharged on approval of the city and the South Fork Sewer District (SFSD) to
a storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or natural outlet. If discharged to the sanitary
sewer system, additional approval will be required from the SFSD.
   (C)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely, in the
opinion of the city or the SFSD, that such wastes can harm either the sewers,
sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, or public property or constitute
a nuisance. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
city and the SFSD will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and maximum limits established by regulatory agencies. The
substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°F, or
65°C;
      (2)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous materials or
oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter or
containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures
between 32°F to 150°F, or 0ºC to 65°C;
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths
horsepower or greater shall be subject to the review of and approval by the
city;
      (4)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid, iron pickling wastes,
or concentrated plating solution whether neutralized or not;
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, lead,
cadmium, or similar objectionable or toxic substances, or wastes exerting an
excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such material received
in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits
established by the South Fork Sewer District for such materials;
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-
producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the city as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage,
to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies of
jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the city in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations;
      (8)   Any wastes or waters having a pH in excess of 9.5;
      (9)   Any mercury or any of its compounds in excess of 0.0005 milligrams
per liter of Hg at any time, except as permitted by the city in compliance with
applicable state and federal regulations;
      (10)   Any cyanide in excess of one milligram per liter at any time,
except as permitted by the city in compliance with applicable state and federal
regulations;
      (11)   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, fuller’s earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate);
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works; or
         (d)   Unusual volumes of flow or concentrations of water constituting
slugs, as defined.
      (12)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the SFSD sewage treatment process, or are amenable to
treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot
meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters;
      (13)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas;
      (14)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids,
liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create
any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant;
      (15)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment, and personnel of the sewage works; and
      (16)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with proper
operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders,
sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood,
garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair, fleshings, and entrails, either
whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (D)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (C) above, and/or which are in
violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in 40 C.F.R. part 403 and
any amendments thereto, and which, in the judgment of the city, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s (EPA) pretreatment requirements. National categorical pretreatment
standards found in 40 C.F.R. chapter 1, subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are
hereby incorporated and made enforceable under this code;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. If the city and the
SFSD permit the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the city and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances, and laws.
   (E)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand,
or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the city, and shall be so located as to
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (F)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.
   (G)   Each industrial business shall be required to install a control
manhole when required by the city upon the city’s identification of a need to
monitor and/or regulate the drainage. The owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s expense and shall be
maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (H)   (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may be required, upon request, to provide laboratory
measurements, tests, and analyses of water and wastes to illustrate compliance
with this subchapter and any special conditions for discharge established by
the city or SFSD having jurisdiction over the discharge.
      (2)   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but, no less than
once per year, the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents
of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state,
and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the city at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the city. At such times as
deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples
for analyses by an outside laboratory service.
   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with regulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency,
the State Department of Environmental Quality, and/or the Panhandle Health
District, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole.
      (1)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
      (2)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily-accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with this subchapter, by the industrial concern provided that such
payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charge
systems.

   The city, and other duly-authorized employees of the city bearing proper
credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties for
the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. The city or authorized
representative shall have no authority to inquire into any processes, including
metallurgical, chemical, oil refining, ceramic, paper, or other industries
beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge
to the sewers or waterway or facilities for waste treatment. Any authorized
employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all private properties for the purposes of, but not limited
to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of
any portion of the sewage works lying within the right-of-way of the city’s
sewer line. All entry and subsequent work on said easement or right-of-way
shall ensure any private property affected is returned to a similar condition
as it existed prior to the entry.

SEWER RATES
§ 51.20 SEWER RATES AND FEES.
   (A)   Monthly sewer rates. The city shall assess a monthly rate for
properties connected to the sewer system.
      (1)   Equivalent residence. One EQUIVALENT RESIDENCE, hereinafter
referred to as ER, shall be defined as the sewage flow from one typical single-
family residence. The sewage flow from one typical single-family residence is
18 cubic feet (CF) of sewage per day, 0.2 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) per day, and 0.2 pounds of suspended solids (SS) per day, based on
average residential water usage.
      (2)   Measuring; sampling. The city may install a measuring device in the
sewer service line at any time to determine the amount of wastewater and/or
collect wastewater samples for testing. After measuring and/or sampling, the
city may adjust the user charge to conform to actual usage.
      (3)   Minimum charge. Each sewer user billed separately shall pay a
minimum charge per month, regardless of actual flow. The minimum charge shall
be one ER as calculated in this section.
      (4)   Nonresidential users; fees. Commercial and industrial connections
shall pay sewer usage fees as determined by the formula: ER = (annual
residential water usage in cubic feet)/12 months/548 CF. A commercial customer
may have his or her ERs reviewed once annually if requested prior to January 1
of the year in which the assessment will apply.
      (5)   Appeal of ERs. A commercial customer may appeal the number of ERs
to the city by filing written notice with the City Clerk outlining the reason
for the customer’s appeal. The City Clerk will deliver the protest to a Review
Board, which will consist of two City Council members appointed by the Mayor.
If the customer is unable to reach an agreement with the Review Board (two
appointed City Council members), he or she may appeal to the City Council at
the next regular City Council meeting. The Review Board and the City Council
shall make their decision of the appeal solely based on the ERs. Any appeals
are due by November 1 of the year proceeding the next billing cycle.
      (6)   Rates set by City Council. The monthly rates assessed to properties
shall be set by the City Council through the passage of a resolution by law. A
disconnected or unoccupied property may still be assessed a fee as established
by resolution of the City Council.
   (B)   New user facility fee (NUFF).
      (1)   Connection. The owners of property connecting to the city sewer
system, directly or by connecting to a private system that connects to the city
sewer system, shall be subject to a new user facility fee which includes
inspection costs.
      (2)   Payment. The NUFF shall be paid in advance or at the time the
building permit is issued.
         (a)   The new user facility fee (NUFF) and service connection fee for
new or modified connections to the city sewer system shall be equal to the
number of ERs times the NUFF and the sewer permit fee for a single-family
residence. In no case shall the NUFF and permit fee be less than that for one
single-family residence (one ER). The fee for a single-family residence (one
ER) shall be the sum of a NUFF, a permit fee, and the inspection fee described
as follows.
         (b)   The new user facility fee and service connection fee shall be
set by resolution adopted by the City Council.
         (c)   In instances where an improvement on a property has previously
been connected to the sewer system and complied with the connection fee(s) in
force at the time of connection, the fees listed above in this division (B) do
not apply. If, however, the connection involves an increase in the number of
ERs or an increase in demand on the system, then the connection is subject to
these fees for the increase only.
         (d)   A permit and inspection fee shall be set by the City Council and
shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. The applicant,
as a condition of permit authorization, must provide information describing its
wastewater constituents, characteristics, and type of activity.
         (e)   A NUFF does not include the cost to install a lateral service
line from the structure to the main. (The cost to install a new lateral service
shall be borne entirely by the property owner.) All new user facility fees
shall be paid in an amount as set by the City Council.
         (f)   An owner may apply for a waiver of the NUFF where he or she can
establish, through sufficient verifiable documentation, that the property
previously had a connection.
   (C)   Sewer fee use. All sewer fees collected, including sewer
capitalization rates, monthly sewer rates, connection fees, and reconnection
fees, shall be used by the city for the sole purpose of improving and
maintaining the city sewer system.
   (D)   Other fees and charges. The city hereby establishes other fees and
charges, including, but not limited to, permit, review, and inspection fees,
periodic service charges and other fees for the use, and for service rendered
by the city.
      (1)   Levy of lots. The rates, charges, and fees provided by this
subchapter are hereby levied and assessed against each lot, parcel of land,
building, or property having any connection with the sanitary sewer of the city
or otherwise discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastewater, or other
liquids directly into the sanitary sewer of the city.
      (2)   Payment by each owner. The rates, charges, and fees shall be billed
to and paid by the owner of each lot, parcel of land, building, or property
served by the sewer system.

§ 51.21 BILLINGS AND PAYMENT OF MONTHLY CHARGES.
   (A)   Billings; Sewer Repair and Maintenance Fund. All billings and fees
levied and assessed hereunder shall be made by the City Clerk, and all monies
received hereunder shall be delivered to the City Clerk, who shall deposit the
same to a special account, to be known as the Sewer Repair and Maintenance
Fund.
   (B)   Due date. Such fees shall be due and payable to the City Clerk on a
quarterly basis. For new construction, the annual user charge shall be computed
from the date the service connection has been inspected and approved or when
the building being served is substantially completed, whichever is the latest
date. For new commercial construction completed during the eight lawn-
sprinkling months, the sewer user charges shall be based on the use of 548 CF
per month, or actual use, whichever is less.
(Prior Code, § 10-4-2) (Ord. 2018-06, passed 12-12-2018)
§ 51.22 DELINQUENCIES.
   (A)   Penalty. The city may assess an appropriate penalty for delinquency as
established through resolution.
   (B)   Lien against property. Where allowed by law, all delinquent charges or
fees, as provided by this subchapter, not paid after the final determination of
the sewer user’s account shall be imposed as a lien against and upon the
property or premises against which such charge or fee is levied or assessed,
and the City Clerk shall, at the time of certifying the city taxes, certify
such delinquencies together with all penalties to the County Tax Collector,
and, when so certified, the same shall be a lien upon the property. All monies
collected by the City Clerk under the provisions of this section shall be paid
over to the City Treasurer in the same manner as is required for the payment of
other city monies.
   (C)   Use at new location. The owner of any property leaving a delinquency
in sewer fees at any location shall not be entitled to the use of the sewer
system at any new location until all fee delinquencies are paid.

51.99
§ 51.23 DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (A)   Termination of water service for nonpayment.
      (1)   If a sewer user has not paid the billing within 14 days from the
date of the statement, it shall be deemed delinquent.
      (2)   The city shall give notice to the owner and occupant of the
delinquency and provide an opportunity to cure the delinquency within 14 days
of the notice.
      (3)   Failure to cure the delinquency may allow the city to cause the
water supplied to said sewer user to be turned off from the premises where
sufficient agreement exists between the city and any associated water district,
with the city taking notice that without water, the sewer system of the user
cannot be used, and shutting off the water is the only way to prevent the use
of the sewer for nonpayment; provided, if the charges are not paid within 14
days after the delinquency notice, and if no penalty is due for nonpayment of
water charges, an additional penalty, as set by resolution of the City Council,
will be added to the account and must be paid to restore service.
   (B)   Discontinue sewer service. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all property served with sanitary sewer within and outside the corporate
limits of the city, including all property owned or occupied by the United
States, the county, and the state, and, in case of nonpayment or delinquency,
the city or its authorized representative is hereby authorized and directed to
disconnect and/or plug the sewer connection with the sewer system and direct
the water district to terminate the water supply to the property.

standing or parking of a vehicle under any ordinance of the city, proof that
the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of
any such ordinance, together with proof that the defendant named in the
complaint was, at the time of parking, the owner of the vehicle, shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the owner of the vehicle was the person
who parked or placed the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during
which, the violation occurred. For the purposes of this section, proof that a
person is the registered owner of a vehicle is not prima facie evidence that
the registered owner has violated any other provision of law.

violator.
   (B)   Rented or leased vehicle. In any prosecution against the lessee or
renter of a motor vehicle charging a violation of any regulation governing the
standing or parking of a vehicle under any ordinance of the city, proof that
the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of

in the complaint was, at the time of parking, the lessee or renter of the

vehicle was the person who parked or placed the vehicle at the point where, and
for the time during which, the violation occurred. For the purposes of this
division (B), proof that a person is the lessee or renter of a vehicle is not
prima facie evidence that the lessee or renter has violated any other provision
of the law.
   (C)   Bona fide sale or transfer. Any charge under such ordinance shall be
dismissed when the person charged has made a bona fide sale or transfer of the
vehicle as evidenced by a valid written instrument showing that possession was
delivered thereof to the purchaser, and has complied with the requirements of
Idaho Code Title 49, Chapter 4, prior to the date of the alleged violation, and
has advised the court of the name and address of the purchaser and the date of
the sale, written proof of which shall be presented to the Chief of Police.

muzzle must not cause injury to the animal or interfere with its vision or
respiration, but must prevent the animal from biting any human or other animal.

place on the owner’s property near the enclosure, kennel, pen, or structure, or
other clearly-visible area, a warning sign indicating that there is a vicious

City Clerk/Treasurer of a certificate of insurance evidencing that the owner of
the animal has procured public liability insurance for at least $50,000,
insuring the owner for any injury or damage which may be caused by the vicious
animal.

Department within 48 hours of the transfer of custody of the animal and shall
provide, to the law enforcement authority, the name, address, and telephone

as is convenient for the City Council; however, it need not be heard at a
regularly-scheduled hearing. All action by the city regarding the subject
portion of said sidewalk shall be stayed pending such a hearing.
   (D)   Should the property owner fail to repair or replace said sidewalk
within 60 days of written notice, the city is empowered to proceed with the
replacement of said sidewalk, utilizing city employees to perform such work or
by contracting with a licensed contractor for said work.
   (E)   Upon completion of said work, the city shall forward to the property
owner a billing itemizing all expenditures for work performed, including a 12%
administrative overhead expense item.
   (F)   Should the property owner fail to pay said bill in full within 30 days
of receipt thereof, a 14% per annum finance charge shall be assessed to said
bill at the annual percentage rate, during the period the bill remains unpaid.
The Mayor is hereby authorized to approve a payment contract not to exceed six
months in duration and requiring the 14% per annum finance charge. Should the
property owner fail to enter into and fulfill a payment contract, said costs
(including financing charges estimated to the tax payment date) shall be

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES.
   The legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain
as follows in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-1) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 6-10-2015)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-1) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 6-10-2015)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; reduce the annual cost of flood insurance; and minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize the expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-1) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 6-10-2015)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Prior Code, § 14-1-1) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 6-10-2015)

feet above the natural ground; a clearly-defined channel does not exist; the
path of flooding is unpredictable, and, velocity flow may be evident.
      (2)   AO is characterized as sheet flow; AH indicates ponding and is
shown with standard base flood elevations.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD (SFHA). The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Zone
designations on FIRMs include the letters A, AE, AO, and AH, also known as the
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS (SFHA).

given year (also referred to as the 100-YEAR FLOOD). Designated on flood
insurance rate maps by the letters A or V.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of surface water resulting from a
flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given
year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous
materials or hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with
this chapter, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with FEMA Form
81-31 § B completed by the city.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the adopted floodplain management regulations.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards
and the risk premium zones applicable to the city, which has been adopted by
the city.

for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected-size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG). The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.

   (A)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear all applications for
a variance.
      (2)   All determinations for variances, appeals, and actions by affected
persons shall be in accordance with §§

appeal such decision to the District Court.
      (6)   In passing upon such appeals, the City Council shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and Floodplain Management Program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets, and
bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   (a)   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level.
         (b)   As the lot size increases, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local, state, and/or federal laws,
rules, or regulations.
      (5)   (a)   Variances, as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance
Program, are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a
physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain
to the structure, its inhabitants, or economic or financial circumstances.
         (b)   Variances primarily address small lots in densely -populated
residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from flood elevations should be
quite rare.
      (6)   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight
or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low
damage potential, complies with all other city ordinances or codes, the
variance criteria specified herein, except division (B)(1) above, and otherwise
complies with §
152.40(A), (C), and (D).
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below
the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk.

FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.40 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required.
   (A)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and
practices that minimize flood damage.
   (B)   AH Zone drainage. Adequate drainage paths are required around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (C)   Construction materials and methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using standard methods and practices within the construction
industry that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   (a)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities, shall be designed and/or
otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
         (b)   Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation may cause
annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.
   (D)   Utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the systems.
      (2)   Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the
floodway.
      (3)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (4)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (E)   Subdivision proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage.
      (4)   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50
lots, or five acres, whichever is less.
   (F)   Review of building permits. Where elevation data is not available
either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative
source (§
152.02(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that
proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of
reasonableness is a local judgment, and includes the use of historical data,
high water marks, photographs of past flooding, and the like, where available.

§ 152.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   Specific standards apply to all areas of special flood hazards, including
the following required standards.
   (A)   Residential construction.
      (1)   (a)   New construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to the flood protection elevation (FPE).
         (b)   Minimum FEMA standards require the lowest floor to be elevated
“to or above” the BFE; however, adding an additional foot of freeboard
increases safety and can reduce insurance premiums by as much as 30%.
         (c)   Additional freeboard is strongly encouraged by FEMA and the
city.
      (2)   All new construction or substantial improvement of an existing
structure, including a structure that has been substantially damaged, that
includes a fully-enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by the
foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed to be an unfinished or
flood- resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry
and exit of floodwater.
         (a)   Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by
a licensed professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   Provide a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above the higher of the exterior or interior grade or floor immediately below
the opening; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices; provided, they permit the automatic flow of
floodwater in both directions without manual intervention.
         (b)   To comply with the “lowest floor” criteria of this chapter, the
unfinished or flood- resistant enclosure shall only be used for the parking of
vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises, or entry to the elevated area.
         (c)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
         (d)   For crawlspace-foundation types, construction must follow the
guidelines in FEMA TB 11-01, Crawlspace Construction for Structures Located in
Special Flood Hazard Areas: National Flood Insurance Program Guidance,
specifically:
            1.   Below-grade crawlspaces are prohibited at sites where the
velocity of floodwaters exceed five feet per second;
            2.   Interior grade of the crawlspace below the BFE must not be
more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG);
            3.   Height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the lowest
interior grade of the crawlspace to the bottom of the floor joist, must not
exceed four feet at any point; and
            4.   Contain an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the
flood protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be floodproofed one foot or more above the base flood level so that
the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy;
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications, and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
152.26(B)(3)(b); and
      (4)   (a)   Applicants who are floodproofing nonresidential buildings
should be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that
are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the
base flood level will be rated as one foot below).
         (b)   Floodproofing the building an additional foot will reduce
insurance premiums significantly.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   (a)   All manufactured homes in the floodplain to be placed or
substantially improved on sites shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to the flood
protection elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately-anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         (b)   All manufactured homes in the floodplain need to minimize flood
damage within the flood prone area.
      (2)   In all areas of special flood hazard where the base flood elevation
has not been established, manufactured homes placed, substantially improved, or
having incurred substantial damage must be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated two feet above
the highest adjacent grade and be securely anchored to an adequately-anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   Manufactured homes placed on solid perimeter walls shall meet the
flood vent requirements in division (A)(2) above, except when the first floor,
including enclosed areas and crawlspace, is located above the base flood
elevation.
   (D)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are
required to either:
      (1)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking
system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and
security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; and/or
      (3)   Meet the requirements of division (C) above and the elevation and
anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.
   (E)   Critical facility.
      (1)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (SFHA, or
100-year floodplain).
         (a)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible
within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.
         (b)   Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the 500-year
flood, whichever is higher.
      (2)   Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected
to the height utilized above.
      (3)   Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that
toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.
      (4)   Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

§ 152.42 AE ZONES WITH BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS BUT NO FLOODWAYS.
   In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been
designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zone AE on the city’s
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point within the city.

§ 152.43 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.41(C) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry debris and
increase erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.

existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement or crawlspace) elevated no less than two feet above the
highest adjacent grade at the building site.
   (B)   Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
§
152.41(A)(2).
(Prior Code, § 14-1-5) (Ord. 2015-02, passed 6-10-2015)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable federal or state regulations. Violations of the provisions
of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with

SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 154.01 PURPOSE.
   These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:
   (A)   To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city without preventing the reasonable development of land;

flooding or erosion;
   (E)   To reduce siltation in the city’s streams, storm sewer systems, and
public roadside improvements;
   (F)   To reduce the risk of slides and the creation of unstable city sites;
   (G)   To promote city- and site-planning practices that are consistent with
the city’s natural topography, soils, and vegetative features while at the same
time recognizing that certain factors, such as insects, disease, danger of
fallings, proximity to existing and proposed structures and improvements,
interference with utility services, protection of scenic views, and the
realization of a reasonable enjoyment of property may require the removal of
certain trees, bushes, shrubs, hedges, ground cover, or other landscaping
materials;
   (H)   To ensure prompt development, restoration, and replanting and
effective erosion control of property after land clearing and grading;
   (I)   To implement the goals and objectives of all city, county, state, and

event, the City Council shall summarily dismiss the appeal.
(Prior Code, § 12-7-2) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.117 TRANSCRIPT.
   (A)   No transcript required. In the event that the City Council determines
that the appeal can be heard as a question of law alone, without the necessity
of a transcript, the City Council shall enter an order to that effect stating
the issue of law to be determined on appeal and setting a day certain for the
hearing upon the appeal.
   (B)   Listening to recording. In the event that the City Council determines

(Prior Code, § 12-7-6) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS
§ 155.135 GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Basis.
      (1)   The City Council has determined that several aspects of
architectural design have a significant impact on the character and value of
the city’s historic districts and that preserving and enhancing this character
requires the existence of a certain harmony and compatibility in these aspects,
from one building to the next and throughout the district.
      (2)   These design guidelines are based on existing design
characteristics commonly observed in the city and will serve as a baseline
description against which plans for new construction and reconstruction can be
judged for harmony, compatibility, and appropriateness.
   (B)   Intent. The intent of these guidelines is not to require particular
architectural features or dictate architectural style; rather, it is to
identify a range of design options which will encourage development compatible
with the existing character of the city and which will discourage the
introduction of incompatible features.
      (1)   Contemporary designs and materials, used in a manner compatible
with the sense of the past that is being preserved, are not only permitted, but
encouraged.
      (2)   Economic feasibility and durability of proposed improvements, along
with aesthetic harmony, are primary concerns.
   (C)   Interpretation. A strict interpretation of these guidelines may be
waived by the Historic Preservation Commission if the applicant develops a
design solution which meets the spirit and intent of these design guidelines in
a better manner. In the same sense, the guidelines presented here are not fixed
and immutable through time, but are subject to continuing study and revision by
the Historic Preservation Commission as the desirability for such modification
becomes apparent.
   (D)   Historic period. Although the criteria for historic designation set
forth in §§
155.040 through
155.043 covers a range of architectural styles and historic periods, the city’s
predominant architectural character is primarily derived from the numerous
buildings and homes that were erected during the period of 1890 through 1920.
It was also during this time that the city rose to prominence and acquired its
greatest historical significance. In the guidelines that follow, this period
from 1890 to 1920 is referred to as the HISTORIC PERIOD and shall represent a
general benchmark to which new and reconstruction building designs should
compatibly relate.
   (E)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Exceptions may occur in cases where reconstruction work is proposed
for buildings of a distinct style but which are different from that which was
typical of the “historic period.”
      (2)   In these cases, the appropriate design choice shall be to respect
the distinct style significant, in its own right and seek to retain the
building’s particular architectural character, especially in terms of its
unique form, scale, proportions, rhythm, modeling, and massing.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-1) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.136 AREA OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   The Historic Preservation Commission will be reviewing three different
kinds of construction activity that require certificates of appropriateness,
and each kind will require a slightly different application of these
guidelines:
      (1)   New construction. For the construction of new buildings and parts
of buildings in historic districts, the focus of the guidelines is on the
compatibility of new construction with the existing predominant historic
character of the city without dictating style or taste.
      (2)   Reconstruction, remodeling, repair. For reconstruction, remodeling,
and repair of existing buildings in historic districts, the guidelines seek to
guide and encourage restoration in line with the original character of the
structure.
      (3)   Relocation. For relocation of buildings to sites within a historic
district, the guidelines seek to ensure that buildings moved to sites within
the district are compatible with the predominant historical character of
surrounding buildings and are suitably situated on the lot.
   (B)   Unless otherwise stated in the text, the guidelines shall apply
equally to construction activity in both the designated commercial historic
district and the designated residential historic district(s).
(Prior Code, § 12-8-2) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.137 SITE ORIENTATION AND DIRECTIONAL EXPRESSION.
   An important factor affecting the character of a historic district concerns
the relationship between a historic building and its orientation toward
adjacent structures and the street. An orderly rhythm in site orientation and
directional expression can also lend harmony to a historic district and evoke a
stronger sense of its historical character.
   (A)   Setbacks.
      (1)   In addition to the setback regulations prescribed in Chapter 156 of
this code of ordinances, the street-facing facade of new and reconstructed
buildings in the Commercial Landmark District should be erected in line with
the street-front setback of existing buildings from the historic period on the
same block.
      (2)   The street-facing facade of new and reconstructed buildings in the
Commercial Historic District should be erected in line with the street-front
setback of existing buildings from the historic period.
   (B)   Directional expression.
      (1)   To preserve the continuity prevailing along most block faces in the
city, the principal facade of new or reconstructed buildings should be oriented
parallel to the street it faces.
      (2)   The principal facade should be oriented parallel to the street it
faces.
   (C)   Front yard additions. To preserve the orderly rhythm of front yard
spacing and the architectural integrity of street-facing facades, front yard
additions to existing buildings in the Residential Historic District should be
generally discouraged when such construction will alter or obscure the street-
facing facade of a building that has been designated as contributing to the
character of the historic district, or if the construction of the addition will
result in a street-facing setback of less than 80% of the average setback of
existing buildings from the historic period on the same block.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-3) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.138 SCALE, PROPORTION, AND RHYTHM.
   The relative portion of a building compared to neighboring buildings, or of
a building to a pedestrian observer, or of a building to its surroundings in
general, is the building’s scale. Scale does more to determine the visual
impact of a structure than does any other single aspect of building design.
Preserving a harmony and compatibility in scale among the buildings in the
city’s historic districts focuses attention on several key dimensions,
including building height, floor elevations, size, and massing.
   (A)   Building height.
      (1)   New and reconstructed buildings should not be erected to a height
greater than 10% of the average height of existing buildings from the historic
period on the same and adjacent blocks. In no case should any building in the
Commercial District be erected to a height greater than the County Courthouse.
      (2)   Buildings should not be erected to a height greater than 10% of the
average height of existing buildings from the historic period on the same and
adjacent blocks.
   (B)   Floor elevations.
      (1)   On new and reconstructed buildings in the Commercial District, the
first floor elevation above the street curb, the entrance door sill elevation,
and the floor-to-floor elevations within the buildings should reflect the
average of comparable elevations of existing buildings from the historic period
on the same and adjacent blocks.
      (2)   In the event the applicant successfully demonstrates, pursuant to
Title 11 of this code of ordinances, the economic necessity of altering the
original elevation of an interior floor or ceiling, such reconstruction shall
be done in a manner that retains the original historic appearance, design,
detail, and modeling of the building’s street-facing facade(s).
   (C)   Size and scale.
      (1)   (a)   The size and scale of new or reconstructed buildings should
be about equal to the average of similar types of existing buildings from the
historic period in the district.
         (b)   Special care should be given to following the building-height-
to-building-width ratio of front building facades on adjacent buildings from
the historic period.
      (2)   The size and scale should be about equal to the average of similar
types of existing buildings from the historic period.
      (3)   In the event it is necessary to construct or reconstruct a building
in such a manner that its size and scale will be inconsistent with that of
adjacent buildings from the historic period, the front facade of such new or
reconstructed buildings should be broken into smaller masses or bays of a size
and scale that is consistent with that of adjacent buildings from the historic
period.
      (4)   Out-of-scale buildings should be broken into smaller masses or bays
of a size and scale that is consistent with adjacent buildings from the
historic period.
   (D)   Massing.
      (1)   New and reconstructed buildings in any historic district should
avoid designs that result in a single, monolithic appearance that is not
relieved by variations in massing. When possible, new and reconstructed
buildings should be broken into varied masses and forms such as are
characteristic of or compatible with typical existing buildings from the
historic period.
      (2)   Building designs should avoid a monolithic appearance.
   (E)   Rhythm.
      (1)   Architectural rhythm is the ordered recurrent alteration of
building masses and spaces across a single facade or along an entire block.
      (2)   Special care should be given to preserving and continuing the
rhythm of solids to voids on street-facing facades and the rhythm of spacing of
buildings along streets.
      (3)   The rhythm of solids to voids on street-facing facades and the
spacing of buildings along streets should be preserved and continued.
   (F)   Walls of continuity.
      (1)   Physical elements, such as brick walls, wrought iron fences,
evergreen landscape masses, building facades, or combinations of these also
contribute to the character and feel of the architecture of a historic period.
      (2)   The design of any new or reconstructed building should seek to
preserve or maintain such character-defining walls of continuity whenever
possible.
      (3)   Walls of continuity should be maintained.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-4) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.139 FORM, DETAIL, AND TREATMENT.
   (A)   Historic character. In addition to site orientation, directional
expression, scale, proportion, and rhythm, the character of the city’s historic
building stock is also defined by the particular modeling of their vertical
facades and roofs. The historic character of the city’s existing buildings is
best expressed when the separate elements that make up the modeling of their
facades and roofs are retained in either their original or essential form.
      (1)   Similarity, the unique character of the city’s historic districts,
is best conveyed when the design of a new building incorporates forms, details,
and treatments that either evoke a sense of the architectural style of the
historic district or avoid distracting from an observer’s sense of the
predominant historic character of the district.
      (2)   Among the most important modeling elements that help define the
historic character of the city’s buildings are cornices, storefronts, window
patterns, roof shapes, siding and roof materials, colors, and textures.
   (B)   Cornices.
      (1)   Many of the buildings erected in the city’s Commercial Landmark
District during the early historic period were designed with a horizontal
cornice on its principal street-facing facade.
      (2)   The cornice, which protrudes from the plane of the facade, marks
and defines the vertical extent of the building and ties it in with adjacent
buildings in the Commercial Historic District.
      (3)   Some cornices in the Commercial Historic District were also
embellished with rich architectural details which today serve as examples of
the form of aesthetic expression that was typical of the city’s turn of the
century architectural design.
      (4)   Cornices should be retained.
      (5)   Horizontal cornice lines should be continued.
      (6)   To help assure continuity from one building to the next in the
Commercial Landmark District and to preserve examples of the city’s early
twentieth-century architectural expression, existing cornices and cornice lines
should be retained. The heights and depths of these cornices on new
construction should be consistent with the average cornice dimensions of
adjacent buildings from the historic period.
   (C)   Storefronts.
      (1)   The traditional storefront is probably the single most important
architectural form that expresses the uniqueness and historical character of
the city’s Commercial Historic District. The city’s existing storefronts convey
a strong sense of the early historic period when commercial architecture and
street design were oriented more to the convenience of the pedestrian than that
of the passing motorist.
      (2)   Although architectural detailing in the traditional storefront
evolved over time and from region to region, its basic form or modeling
remained essentially the same. In the city, it consisted of a consciously-
proportioned configuration of less than a dozen interconnected design elements,
including (from street level upwards): a low-paneled bulkhead surmounted by an
expanse of display windows with transom windows above and a storefront cornice
or signboard delineating the vertical extent of the first story. Either side of
the storefront was typically finished with vertical piers of pilasters, often
of masonry construction, that usually extended to the roof cornice and served
to frame the sides of the building. The upper stories of the city’s storefronts
typically consisted of regularly-spaced windows, often topped by window hoods,
lintels, or voussoirs, and cast against masonry wall. The top of the
traditional storefront building was usually finished with a parapet wall and a
protruding decorative cornice.
      (3)   The basic design elements of the storefront should be retained or
reclaimed.
      (4)   Construction work on Commercial Historic District storefronts
should retain these basic storefront design elements where they exist, and seek
to reclaim them when they have been altered or lost. Attention should also be
given to retaining or restoring the original rhythm and proportions of these
design elements on all building facades and exterior walls.
      (5)   New construction work in the Commercial Historic District should
consider designs that are either compatible with the traditional storefront or
allude to its typical form, rhythm, and proportions. In no case, however,
should new construction design seek to replicate or imitate specific motifs or
details of the traditional storefront design.
      (6)   Preapproved siding styles are available from the City Clerk at City
Hall. When using one or a multiple of these preapproved items, an application
for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the pre-approved choices will
not be subject to a public hearing on the application; rather, a certificate of
appropriateness may be immediately issued by the City Clerk or the Chair of the
Commission to the applicant.
   (D)   Window patterns.
      (1)   The predominant window configuration on street-facing facades in
the city exhibits a regularity in proportion and size of window openings and in
the rhythm and order with which they are arranged.
      (2)   Preapproved window styles are available from the City Clerk at City
Hall. When using any one or a multiple of these preapproved items, an
application for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the preapproved
choices will not be subject to a public hearing on the application; rather, a
certificate of appropriateness may be immediately issued by the City Clerk or
the Chair of the Commission to the applicant.
      (3)   Proposed designs for window arrangements in new construction should
be compatible with and avoid distracting from the predominant window pattern of
adjacent buildings from the historic period. In cases of remodeling or
reconstruction in all historic districts, a building’s historic window pattern
should be retained or reclaimed. Where that is not possible, the predominant
window pattern of existing buildings from the historic period should be
followed as a design guide.
      (4)   Window patterns should be retained and reclaimed.
   (E)   Window replacement.
      (1)   In cases where the replacement of a window is required, the
replacement should match the original window, fill the entire opening, and
duplicate the original window pattern. If possible, the original sash and frame
material should be matched.
      (2)   Window replacements should match the original window, fill the
entire opening, and duplicate the original window pattern.
      (3)   In circumstances where metallic windows must be used, the metallic
sashes and frame should be of a dark anodized or baked enamel finish so as to
minimize the obtrusiveness of the bright metallic color.
   (F)   Storm windows.
      (1)   When storm windows are required, they should be designed and
installed in such a manner that they appear to be an integral part of the
building. If mounted on the exterior of the building, they should resemble the
inner window as closely as possible in shape and appearance and should be
painted to match the color of the inner window sash. On street-facing facades,
it may be desirable to consider installing storm windows on the inside where
they will not be seen from the street.
      (2)   Storm windows should resemble the inner window as closely as
possible in shape and appearance.
   (G)   Blocking windows and doors.
      (1)   The practice of blocking-up or blocking-down window and door
openings substantially alters the historic appearance of a building and the
historic rhythm of forms and openings of adjacent buildings along the block.
      (2)   Blocking should always be avoided in reconstruction work on
existing structures.
      (3)   If, pursuant to this chapter, it is found absolutely necessary to
alter an interior ceiling beyond an original alley or street-facing window head
or sill, such alteration shall be done in a manner that retains the full
exterior height of the window, preserves its original proportions and rhythm on
all of the building’s street-facing facades, and retains or replicates the
historic siding material and modeling forms on all surfaces affected by the
altering of the ceiling.
   (H)   Roofs.
      (1)   The principal roof form in the city’s Commercial Historic District
is the flat roof with parapet wall. Many of the city’s parapets are also
finished with pediments, corbelling, protruding cornices, and/or molded
friezes. The predominance of this roof form contributes an important element of
order to the Commercial Landmark District, especially when the city is viewed
from higher elevations. The parapeted flat roof also serves to integrate the
city’s diverse facades into a coherent whole and provides a strong sense of the
historic period in which the city rose to prominence.
      (2)   Parapet roofs and their decorative embellishments should be
retained.
      (3)   Preapproved roofing choices are available from the City Clerk at
City Hall. When using any one or multiple of these preapproved items, an
application for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the preapproved
items or an application for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the
preapproved choices will not be subject to a public hearing on the application;
rather, a certificate of appropriateness may be immediately issued by the City
Clerk or the Chair of the Commission to the applicant.
      (4)   Reconstruction work on all buildings in the Commercial Landmark
District should always seek to retain existing parapeted roofs and their
respective decorative embellishments. Roof designs for new construction in the
Commercial Landmark District should seek compatibility with adjacent buildings
from the historic period through the use of roof forms and horizontal cornice
lines that allude to the predominant parapeted roof pattern of the Commercial
District.
   (I)   Materials and textures.
      (1)   Variety in the use of materials and textures is important for the
interest and intimacy it conveys and the historic character it is capable of
evoking.
      (2)   (a)   The choice of materials and textures for reconstruction
designs should be limited to those that were available and typically used at
the time the building in question gained historical significance. In cases
where a historic building’s roof or siding material has deteriorated beyond
repair, or for any other necessary reason requires replacement, the choice of a
new replacement material should match the original material as closely as
possible in terms of composition, size, shape, color, and texture.
         (b)   Material choices for new and reconstruction designs in all
historic districts should avoid, whenever possible, the use of contemporary
synthetic, metallic, and similar building materials that imitate the appearance
of historic building materials such as iron, wood, or stone.
      (3)   Designs for new construction should incorporate only those
materials and textures that either allude to or are compatible with the
predominant materials and textures from the historic period.
   (J)   Colors.
      (1)   In the city, historic color schemes varied by availability of
pigments, stylistic preferences of the period, the type of surface to which
paint was applied, and the dictates of climate.
      (2)   Whenever possible, paint choices in all historic districts should
be limited to those colors, if any, that are known to have been used on the
structure in the historic period. In the absence of such information, color
choices should be limited to those that were available and appropriate for the
building’s style and historic period, and their compatibility with adjacent
structures in the historic district.
      (3)   Preapproved color choices are available from the City Clerk at City
Hall. When using any one or a multiple of these preapproved colors, an
application for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the preapproved
color choices will not be subject to a public hearing on the application;
rather, a certificate of appropriateness may be immediately issued by the City
Clerk or the Chair of the Commission to the applicant.
      (4)   Care should be given to avoiding the application of paint to
surfaces that were not painted in the historic period, and, conversely, paint
should not be entirely removed from historic surfaces that required the
protection of paint or equivalent sealants to inhibit deterioration from the
weather.
      (5)   As a general rule, the removal of paint from historic exterior
woodwork, masonry, and metal should be avoided unless absolutely essential.
Once conditions warranting removal have been identified, however, paint should
be removed to the next sound layer using the gentlest method possible.
   (K)   Architectural details.
      (1)   Architectural details and ornamentation represent unique historic
elements of the city’s architecture and are important components of the city’s
historic character. Their uniqueness, distinctiveness, and ubiquity helps set
the city’s historic character apart from all other historic communities in the
region.
      (2)   Significant architectural details should not be lost in the
rehabilitation or “modernization” of existing buildings in the city’s historic
districts. Reconstruction efforts should respect and enhance the original
architectural integrity of a historic structure and should attempt to retain
such characteristic architectural detail as:
         (a)   Modillioned cornices and pedimented parapet walls;
         (b)   Keystones, voussoirs, and window hoods;
         (c)   Masonry lintels, sills, and relieving arches;
         (d)   Transom windows, fanlights, and sidelights around doors;
         (e)   Multi-colored patterned brick;
         (f)   Wood window frames and mullions; and
         (g)   Friezes, entablatures, and string courses.
   (L)   Fences. Pre-approved fence styles are available from the City Clerk at
City Hall. When using one or a multiple of these preapproved items, an
application for a certificate of appropriateness indicating the pre-approved
choices will not be subject to a public hearing on the application; rather, a
certificate of appropriateness may be immediately issued by the City Clerk or
the Chair of the Commission to the applicant.

2007; Ord. 2013-01, passed 5-8-2013)
§ 155.140 ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
   In addition to the specific reconstruction guidelines promulgated in this
chapter, design proposals for reconstruction work in landmark districts should
also consider the principles and recommendations set forth in the Secretary of
the Interior’s most recent edition of the Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-6) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.141 PREDEMOLITION DESIGN REVIEW.
   When an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a building in a
historic district is submitted for review, and when that application involves
the demolition of all or a portion of the building or structures within the
boundaries of the historic district, the Commission shall review the post-
demolition plans for the property in terms of the design guidelines and
standards enumerated in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-7) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.142 CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC IMPACT.
   (A)   Commission consideration. Upon application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission shall, when requested by the property owner,
consider evidence of the economic impact on the owner of denial or partial
denial of a certificate of appropriateness. In no case may a certificate be
denied, in whole or in part, where the Commission establishes that the denial
or partial denial will, when available incentives are utilized, deprive the
owner of a reasonable economic use of the designated property within a landmark
district. A certificate of appropriateness shall be granted, subject to
conditions stipulated by the Commission, if a structural evaluation by the
owner and confirmed by the Commission demonstrates that the significant feature
or features at issue are beyond reasonable repair and a hazardous condition
exists.
   (B)   Factors considered for denial or partial denial.
      (1)   In determining whether denial or partial denial of a certificate of
appropriateness will permit the owner of a reasonable economic use of
designated property in a historic district, the Commission shall consider the
following factors:
         (a)   The market value of the designated property in its existing
condition, taking into consideration the ability to maintain, operate, or
rehabilitate the designated property with the alterations or changes sought by
the owner, and without the alterations or changes sought by the owner.
Available incentives shall be included in both calculations of market value;
         (b)   The owner’s yearly net return on the designated property to the
extent available during the five years prior to the hearing;
         (c)   Estimates of the owner’s future net yearly return on the
designated property with and without the alterations or changes sought by the
owner and with available incentives;
         (d)   The net return and the rate of return necessary to attract
capital for investment in such designated property and in the land on which the
designated property is situated without the alterations or changes sought by
the owner and available incentives, if such information is available or, if
such information is not available; in a comparable building, structure, area,
or site and in the land on which such comparable building, structure, area, or
site is situated; and
         (e)   The net return and rate of return realized on comparable
buildings, structures, areas, or sites not subject to this chapter.
      (2)   Upon written request from the Commission, the owner or person in
charge shall provide the Commission with such information as is necessary and
sufficient to make the determinations required hereunder.
   (C)   Appointment of expert. Upon reasonable notice to the owner, the
Commission may appoint an expert or experts to provide advice and/or testimony
concerning the value of the property, the availability of incentives and the
economic impacts of approval, denial, or partial denial of a certificate of
appropriateness.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-8) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.143 CHANGE IN USE OF LANDMARK PROPERTY.
   (A)   Notice of proposed action. An individual landmark property designated
pursuant to this chapter and not included within the bounds of a landmark
district may be demolished, materially altered, remodeled, relocated, or put to
a different use only after 180 days’ written notice of the owner’s proposed
action has been given to the Commission.
   (B)   Acquisition by Commission. During this period, the Commission may
negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a
means of preserving the designated landmark. During this period, or at any time
prior thereto following notice of designation to the owner, and where such
action is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the continued preservation of
the designated landmark, the Commission may enter into negotiations with the
owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, or exchange of the designated
landmark or any interest therein.
   (C)   Reduction of waiting period. The Commission may reduce the waiting
period required by this section in any case where the owner would suffer
extreme hardship unless a reduction in the required period were allowed.
   (D)   Waiver of waiting period. The Commission shall have the discretionary
authority to waive all or any portion of the required waiting period, provided
that the alteration, remodeling, relocation, or change of use is undertaken
subject to conditions agreed to by the Commission ensuring the continued
maintenance of the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural
integrity and character of the property.
   (E)   Forfeiture of designation status. Any historic property that is
demolished, materially altered, remodeled, relocated, or put to different use
pursuant to the provisions of this section may, at the discretion of the
Commission, forfeit its right to designation status and all the rights,
incentives, and entitlement conditioned by that designation status.

zoning laws and regulations or by any other laws and regulations, the City
Council shall be empowered, pursuant to Idaho Code § 67-4612, to provide by
ordinances special conditions or restrictions for the protection, enhancement,
and preservation of a landmark, landmark site, or landmark district properties.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-10) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.145 EXEMPTION FROM HEALTH AND BUILDING CODES.
   The City Council, in order to promote the preservation and restoration of a
landmark, landmark site, or landmark district properties within its
jurisdiction, may exempt a landmark, landmark site, or landmark district from
the application of such standards contained in the County Health or City
Building Codes, or both, as the City Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, shall determine would otherwise prevent or seriously hinder the
preservation or restoration of said landmark, landmark site, or landmark
district.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-11) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.146 TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS.
   The Commission may establish procedures authorizing owners of a designated
landmark, landmark site, or landmark district properties to transfer
development rights in such amounts and subject to such conditions as the City
Council shall determine. For the purposes of this section, DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
are the rights granted under this section respecting the permissible bulk and
size of improvements erected thereon.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-12) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)
§ 155.147 DUTY TO KEEP IN GOOD REPAIR.
   The owner, occupant, or other person in actual charge of a landmark or an
improvement, building, or structure in a landmark district shall keep in good
repair all of the exterior portions of such improvement, building, or
structure, all of the interior portions thereof when subject to control as
specified in the designating ordinance or permit, and all interior portions
thereof whose maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of
any exterior architectural feature.
(Prior Code, § 12-8-13) (Ord. 492, passed 7-14-1987)

ineligible for designation may, within 35 calendar days of the date of notice
of the determination, petition the Commission for reconsideration of that
determination on the grounds that the determination was based on errors or
omissions of fact or that new information bearing on the determination and not
discoverable by the petitioner at the time of the determination is available.
The petition for reconsideration shall be filed with the Commission and shall
be accompanied by a statement of the grounds for the petition and supporting
documents.
      (2)   Commission action. Within 60 calendar days of receiving the
petition for reconsideration, the Commission shall make review of the record,
affirm, modify, or reverse its prior determination, and may render a revised
determination. The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a hearing on the
petition for reconsideration.
      (3)   Writ of certiorari. The action of the Commission denying
reconsideration and affirming its determination that a cultural resource is
ineligible for designation shall be final, unless, within 20 calendar days from
the date of the action, an interested person of record obtains a writ of
certiorari from the District Court of the county for the purpose of review of
the action taken.
   (C)   Notice of appeal.
      (1)   Appeal. Any interested person of record aggrieved by a decision of
the Commission designating or rejecting a nomination for designation as

      (4)   Request additional information. The City Council’s consideration
shall be based upon the record only; however, the City Council may, at its
discretion, publicly request additional information of the appellant, the
Commission, or other knowledgeable persons.
      (5)   Final action of City Council. The City Council shall take final
action on any appeal from a decision of the Commission by adoption of an
ordinance, and, when so doing, it shall make of the Commission by adoption of
an ordinance, and, when so doing, it shall make and enter findings of fact from

GEOGRAPHIC DESIGNATION
§ 155.160 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city’s Historic Preservation Commission has duly convened and made
investigative conclusions regarding the quality of significance in American,
Idaho, or city history, architecture, archaeology, or culture that is present
in the sites, buildings, structures, and objects that constitute the proposed
historic district, and that they possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
      (1)   Are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of such history; or
      (2)   They embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or
method of construction or represent the work of a master, or possess high
artistic value, or that they represent a significant and distinguishable area
whose components may lack individual distinction.
   (B)   It was further determined by the city’s Historic Preservation
Commission that should any particular buildings, structures, features, sites,
or surroundings be deemed to lack individual distinction or historic integrity,
that the proposed historic district as a whole conveys an overall sense of the
time and place of the period of which the elements of the district gained
historic significance, and therefore, the historic district is significant as a
whole. Said investigative findings of the city’s Historic Preservation
Commission shall be hereby adopted.
(Ord. 2020-04, passed 10-28-2020)
§ 155.161 DESIGNATION; CONTROL.
   (A)   Designation. That, pursuant to the provisions of §§
155.059 and
156.094 of this code of ordinances, the City Council approves the formal
designation of the following historic district as the Historic District:
“That geographical area, including the boundaries and resource status
(contributory, compatible, noncontributory) established in the 1979 Wallace
Historic District under the National Register of Historic Places nomination,
inclusive of the 1983 and 2000 boundary increases and resource status
designations, and further inclusive of any future boundary increases or
resource status designations as may be made to the Wallace Historic District
under the National Register of Historic Places.”
   (B)   Controls. A certificate of appropriateness must be obtained from the
Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to §§
155.075 through
155.084 and
156.095 before the owners may make alterations or changes to the exterior of
any property within the defined Historic District above.

DISTRICT MAPS AND INTERPRETATIONS
§ 156.035 ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The following zoning districts are hereby established. For the
interpretation of this subchapter, the zoning districts have been formulated to
realize the general purposes as set forth in this subchapter. In addition, the
specific purpose of each zoning district shall be as stated.
(Prior Code, § 13-4-1) (Ord. 468, passed 4-15-1980)
§ 156.036 ZONING DISTRICTS DEFINED.
   (A)   Natural Resource District (NR). The purpose of the Natural Resource
District is to preserve and maintain the rural character of the land. This
District is also established to allow uses as designated by the Comprehensive
Plan in areas where commercial, industrial, and residential uses can exist side
by side, and where the establishment of a separate district or single-use
district would not be desirable.
   (B)   Holding District (H). The purpose of a Holding District is to maintain
the current vacant character of the site until such time as logical development
shall occur.
   (C)   Single-Family Residential District (R-0). The purpose of the R-
0 District is to promote the establishment of medium-low density, single-family
dwellings, excluding mobile homes, not to exceed ten dwelling units per net
acre. Centralized water and sewer facilities are required.
   (D)   Residential District (R-1). The purpose of the R-1 District is to
promote the establishment of medium-low density, single-family dwellings not to
exceed ten dwelling units per net acre. Centralized water and sewer facilities
are required.
   (E)   Multi-Family Residential District (R-2). The purpose of the R-
2 District is to promote the establishment of medium density, two-family and
multiple-family dwellings not to exceed 12 dwelling units per net acre. This
District is also designed to promote the logical transition of larger older
homes in well-established neighborhoods to multi-family dwellings.
   (F)   Neighborhood Business District (C-1). The purpose of the C-1 District
is to permit the establishment of convenience business uses which tend to meet
the daily needs of the residents of an immediate neighborhood. Such District
shall be strategically located with access to a collector thoroughfare.
Marginal strip development shall be prohibited.
   (G)   Service Business District (C-2). The purpose of the C-2 District is to
permit the establishment of areas for highway and service business uses only.
This District is specifically designed in clusters to service the motoring
public. This District is generally associated with interchange areas along the
major limited access highways.
   (H)   General Commercial (GC). The GC District is intended to create,
preserve, or enhance areas with a wide range of retail sales and service
establishments serving both long-term and short-term needs in compact locations
typically appropriate to commercial clusters developed in urban-density areas.
This District also includes some development which does not strictly fit the
description of this chapter, but also does not merit a zoning district.
   (I)   Light Manufacturing District (M-1). The purpose of the M-1 District is
to encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale business
establishments which are clean, quiet, and free of hazardous or objectionable
elements, such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare, and shall operate
entirely within enclosed structures and generate little industrial traffic.
Research activities are encouraged. This District is further designed to act as
a transitional use between heavy manufacturing uses and other less intense
business and residential uses.
   (J)   Heavy Manufacturing District (M-2). The purpose of the M-2 District is
to encourage the development of major manufacturing, processing, warehousing,
and major research and testing operations. These activities require extensive
community facilities and reasonable access to arterial thoroughfares.
(Prior Code, § 13-4-2) (Ord. 468, passed 4-15-1980)
§ 156.037 ZONING MAP ADOPTION.

matter thereon, are hereby adopted as part of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13-5-1) (Ord. 468, passed 4-15-1980)
§ 156.038 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning
districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following shall apply.
   (A)   Centerline. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following the centerline of street lines, highway right-of-way lines, streams,
lakes, or other bodies of water, the centerline shall be construed to be such
boundary.
   (B)   Lot lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they
approximately follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be
said boundaries.
   (C)   Parallel to centerlines. Where district boundaries are so indicated
that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, or the
centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall
be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as
indicated on the Official Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map.
   (D)   Railroad line. Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad
line, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main
tracts of said railroad line.

permit application, as specified in the Official Schedule of District
Regulations.
      (2)   The Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a

public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;

and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,

deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (B)   Findings of fact. A variance shall not be granted unless the
Commission makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented to it which support conclusions that the above- mentioned
standards and conditions have been met by the applicant.

      (1)   Authority. Authority to exercise the regulatory power of zoning in
land-use planning shall not simultaneously displace coexisting eminent domain
authority granted under the State Constitution, Article I, § 14, and Idaho Code
Title 7, Chapter 7.
      (2)   Just compensation. An affected person claiming just compensation
for a perceived taking, the basis of the claim being that a specific zoning
action or permitting action restricting private property development is
actually a regulatory action by local government deemed as necessary to
complete the development of the material resources of the state, or necessary
for other public uses, may seek a judicial determination of whether the claim
comes within defined provisions of State Constitution, Article 1, § 14,
relating to eminent domain. Under these circumstances, the affected person is
exempt from the provisions of division (A) of this section and may seek
judicial review through an inverse condemnation action specifying neglect by
local government to provide just compensation under the provisions of the State
Constitution Article I, § 14, and Idaho Code Title 7, Chapter 7.

§ 157.01 MOUNTAIN OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT ESTABLISHED.
   The Mountain Overlay (MO) zoning district is established to identify those
areas where, after due investigation, study and deliberation, the Wallace City
Council finds that orderly development of hillside areas is vital to the public
interest; that the City should regulate access to, erosion of, and damage from
construction on hillsides; that it is obligated to protect the public health,
safety and welfare; and that special regulations regarding hillside development
should be imposed within such district. Site alterations within the Mountain
Overlay district require a Mountain Overlay site alteration permit, which is a
type of special use permit authorized by Idaho Code § 67-6512.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.02 PURPOSES.
   The Mountain Overlay zoning district is established for the following
purposes:
   (A)   To protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
Wallace;
   (B)   To encourage land uses harmonious with existing natural resources;
   (C)   To protect scenic beauty and scenic values;
   (D)   To prohibit detrimental alteration of existing topography and terrain,
leaving hillsides and steep sided canyons generally open and unobstructed, to
prohibit scarring by roadways;
   (E)   To protect natural land features and wildlife habitat;
   (F)   To minimize or prohibit alteration of hillsides, steep slopes,
canyons, and ridges;
   (G)   To facilitate adequate provision of public services and facilities
(i.e., water and sewer, and police, fire and ambulance protection) through
standards appropriate to local conditions;
   (H)   To minimize or prohibit detrimental effects on the natural topography,
geology, soils, drainage, wildlife and vegetation;
   (I)   To prevent unsafe development into areas at risk to wildfires;
   (J)   To carry out provisions contained in Wallace's comprehensive plan;
   (K)   To minimize the visual impact of building sites and access drives at
higher elevations;
   (L)   To protect hillsides in Wallace which are physically and
topographically unique due to their present lack of access roads and thus their
lack of development;
   (M)   To ensure preservation of hillsides, steep slopes, and ridgelines and
their natural features which are visible from the valley floor from obstruction
by development;
   (N)   To protect and enhance the City of Wallace's designation as a
historical site by preserving the natural environment and mountains surrounding
Wallace;
   (O)   To assure the property owner is not deprived of economically viable
use of his/her property; and
   (P)   To ensure that building, excavation, filling or vegetation on ridges
or hillsides will not have a material visual impact on a significant hillside
or skyline visible from a public vantage point entering the City or within the
City. "Material," as the term is used herein shall be construed in light of the
magnitude of the negative impact on the purposes outlined herein.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The Mountain Overlay zoning district boundaries shall be an overlay district
and shall designate those areas within the City found to be hillside and
mountain areas that, due to their steepness of slope, high visibility from
other areas within and outside of the City by the general public, unique
physical characteristics including, steep mountain slopes, canyons, ridges,
and/or skyline juxtaposition among other mountain slopes, require regulation in
order to carry out the purposes of this district. The Mountain Overlay zoning
district shall include those areas so designated illustratively on the "zoning
map of the City of Wallace, Idaho" as presently exists or as adopted hereafter,
and more specifically defined as follows:
   The Mountain Overlay regulations shall apply to those areas within City
limits having a slope of 25% or greater. Existing parcels zoned for residential
use as of the adoption date of this chapter shall be exempted from the
requirements of the Mountain Overlay regulations.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.04 USES PERMITTED.
   The Mountain Overlay zoning district shall be an overlay district and shall
apply the requirements of the Mountain Overlay in addition to the uses and
requirements contained in the underlying base zoning district.
   (A)   Single family residential use (excluding mobile homes/trailers) is
permitted in the Mountain Overlay zoning district, consistent with regulations
contained in this chapter.
   (B)   Any approved development shall be limited to a single-family dwelling
and one approved outbuilding/garage per ten acre parcel. Setback for buildings
and structures shall be 50 feet from all property lines.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.05 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   The regulations contained in this chapter are imposed upon construction,
development and use of all real property within the Mountain Overlay zoning
district. Each of the following activities shall be subject to design review
and shall require approval under the regulations contained in this chapter
prior to issuance of a building permit, Mountain Overlay site alteration permit
or commencement of any work associated with any such activity:
   (A)   Construction or placement of buildings or structures, including
additions to any such structures or buildings existing at the effective date
hereof, upon real property within the Mountain Overlay Zoning District.
   (B)   All grading activity involving more than 50 cubic yards.
   (C)   Any activity regulated by City or state street standards. Included
therein are standards for private driveways.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.06 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following design standards are imposed upon construction, development,
excavation and use of all real property within the Mountain Overlay zoning
district. These standards are intended to provide a framework for development
that is sensitive to the unique characteristics of hillside properties.
   (A)   Criteria and standards. The following list of criteria shall be
considered and addressed by each applicant seeking design review approval. The
commission will use this list of design review criteria as a basis to determine
whether a project is to be approved, approved with conditions or denied:
      (1)   There shall be no building on ridgelines which would have a
material visual impact on a significant skyline visible from a public vantage
point entering the City or within the City.
      (2)   Building, excavating, filling and vegetation disturbance on
hillsides which would have a material visual impact visible from a public
vantage point entering the City or within the City shall be minimized.
      (3)   Preservation of significant landmarks shall be encouraged and
protected, where applicable. A significant landmark is one which gives
historical and/or cultural importance to the neighborhood and/or community.
      (4)   Structure location. Design of building sites shall be sensitive to
the natural terrain. Structures shall be located in such a way as to minimize
grading and to preserve natural features. Careful consideration shall be given
to the general orientation of the slope when locating structures.
      (5)   Development must be compatible with the general scale (height,
dimensions, overall mass) of development in vicinity.
      (6)   Cuts and fills visual mitigation. The visual impact of cuts and
fills shall be mitigated by methods approved by the City. This mitigation may
include, but is not limited to, the placement of buildings in front of the cuts
and/or the placement of retaining walls designed to blend with the surrounding
terrain to stabilize the cut. Mitigation shall predominantly be contour grading
along with plantings as identified on the approved landscape plan that will
stabilize the cut or fill slope and blend with the surrounding vegetation. The
use of retaining walls is to be as limited in scope and height as feasible to
ensure the visual predominance of vegetation. Contour grading techniques shall
be used to provide a natural appearing variety of slope transitions, slope
percentage and slope direction in a three-dimensional, undulating pattern
similar to existing, adjacent terrain.
         (a)   Hard edges left by cut and fill operations shall be given a
rounded appearance that closely resembles the natural contours of the land.
         (b)   Manmade slopes adjacent to roadways shall be softened where
feasible by sufficient berms, contour grading, and/or landscaping to create
visually interesting and pleasing streetscapes.
      (7)   Cut and fill slopes shall be no greater than 15' each in order to
ensure effective screening by vegetation. Cut and fill slopes shall have a
minimum 20' setback from the property line to provide for vegetation buffer and
screening.
      (8)   Any activity involving roads or driveways shall ensure compliance
with Wallace City Code standards pertaining to Site Development, Excavation
Control, and shall conform to the standards for roadway and street construction
as adopted by the Idaho Transportation Department in existence at the time of
such activity.
      (9)   Grading, excavation, site development, and roadway standards as
well as other applicable building code standards shall be met. All applications
for permitting of grading activity shall be submitted with detailed plans
including location, an analysis of the environmental impact and plan to address
erosion control.
      (10)   All roads or driveways shall be reviewed and approved by the
District Fire Chief in order to ensure fire code minimums are met for safe
access and emergency response vehicles.
      (11)   Any site development involving roads, driveways, grading, or
activities done under the Forest Practices Act must conform to these standards
for any actual or anticipated use other than forestry.
      (12)   All development shall have access for fire and other emergency
vehicles to within 150 feet of the furthest exterior wall of any building.
      (13)   International Building Code (IBC) and International Fire Code
(IFC) and Wallace Fire Department requirements shall be met.
      (14)   Public water and sewer service shall comply with the requirements

§ 157.11 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Power to authorize. The Commission may authorize in specific cases
such variance from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming
of neighboring lands, structure, or buildings in the same district and no
permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance.
   (B)   Hardship. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience
or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this title
would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (C)   Required information. A variance from the terms of this title shall
not be granted by the Commission unless and until a written application for a

to the land, structure, or building involved which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this title.
      (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
   (E)   Action by commission.
      (1)   Upon receipt of the application for an appeal or a variance, the
Commission shall hold a public hearing, publish notice in the local newspaper
and give written notice to all affected persons within 300 feet of the subject
property.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible for reimbursement to the City
for all out-of-pocket costs resulting from the application and may require a
deposit at the time of filing of the application in an amount established by
resolution.
      (3)   Within sixty (60) days after the public hearing, the Commission
shall either approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the request for
appeal or variance. Upon granting or denying an application, the Commission

the standards used in evaluating the application, and the action, if any, that
could be taken by the applicant to obtain approval.
(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.12 APPEALS.
   (A)   An appeal of any decision or determination of the Planning and Zoning
or Historic Preservation Commission ("the Commission") made in the
administration or enforcement of this chapter may be taken by any affected
person, as that term is defined by Idaho Code § 67-6521, as it may be amended

with the City Clerk in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
      (1)   Action required by the City Clerk. The clerk shall certify that all
procedural requirements have been satisfied and fees paid and transmit to the

together with the decision or determination of the Commission. A verbatim
transcript of the Commission proceedings shall be prepared and transmitted to
the Council at the appellant's expense.
      (2)   Hearing and notice. The Council shall, following receipt of the
clerk's certificate and the record of the case, set the matter for hearing and
give notice of the date, time, place and purpose thereof and of the right to
request a copy of the decision thereon, to the appellant, the Commission, and
to any other affected person, as defined in Idaho Code § 67-6521, as that
section may be amended from time to time, all in accordance with Idaho Code §§
67-6501 et seq., as may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Authority of Council. Upon hearing the appeal, the Council shall
consider only matters which were previously considered by the Commission as
evidenced by the record, the order, requirement, decision or determination of
the Commission and the notice of appeal, together with oral presentation and
written legal arguments by the appellant, the applicant, if different than the
appellant, and the Commission and/or staff representing the Commission. The
Council shall not consider any new facts or evidence at this point. The Council
may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision or
determination of the Commission. Furthermore, the Council may remand the
application to the Commission for further consideration with regard to specific
criteria stated by the Council.
      (4)   Decision by Council. The Council shall enter a decision within 30
days after the hearing on appeal, which shall include its written decision
separately stated. The Council shall transmit a copy of the decision to the

      (1)   The written notice of appeal shall be filed before 5:00 p.m. of the
fifteenth calendar day after the decision or determination of the Commission
has been made or after findings of fact have been approved by the Commission,
whichever occurs later. The failure to physically file a notice of appeal with
the City Clerk within the time limits prescribed by this section shall be
jurisdictional and shall cause automatic dismissal of such appeal. The notice
of appeal shall be in writing and in such form as shall be available from the
office of the administrator, which shall require to be set forth with
specificity all bases for appeal, including the particulars regarding any
claimed error or abuse of discretion.
      (2)   An affected person aggrieved by a decision of the City Council may
seek judicial review with the District Court within twenty-eight (28) days

that is the subject of such action may submit a written request for a
regulatory takings analysis with the clerk or the agency or entity undertaking

procedure outlined in Idaho Code § 67-8003.

(Ord. 2022-06, passed 10-12-2022)
§ 157.13 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   No owner or agent of the owner shall construct, use or occupy any
building, structure or improvement upon real property in violation of this
title. The landowner, tenant, subdivider, builder, or any other person who
commits, allows, participates in, assists in or maintains such violation shall
be found guilty of such a violation. The provisions of this title shall be
enforced in the following manner:
      (1)   A violation of this title shall be a misdemeanor, punishable by a
fine not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment in the County Jail for a period not
to exceed six months, or both. Each day that such a violation continues shall
constitute a separate criminal offense. A misdemeanor offense occurs where:
         (a)   Any violation of any of the provisions of this title exists in
any building or any other structure or on a tract of land; and
         (b)   An order to remove any such violation has been served upon the
owner, general agent, lessee or tenant of the building, other structure or
tract of land (or any part thereof), or upon the architect, builder, contractor
or any other person who commits or assists in any such violation; and
         (c)   Such person fails to comply with such order within ten days
after service.
      (2)   Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken at law or in
equity to prevent any violation of these regulations, to prevent unlawful
construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation,
or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises, and these
remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described above.
      (3)   No building permit or other approval or permit shall be issued for
the construction of any building, structure or improvement in violation of this
title, nor shall any other permit be approved for an applicant where there is
an outstanding unresolved violation by the same applicant or property owner.
The issuance or granting of a permit or approval shall not be construed to be a
permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this
title or of any other ordinance, rule or regulation of the City. No permit
presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this title
shall be valid.
      (4)   In addition to any of the foregoing remedies, the City attorney,
acting on behalf of the City Council, may maintain an action for an injunction
to restrain any violation of this title. Any costs associated with the
enforcement of this chapter shall be assessed to the property owner, and
failure to pay said costs may result in the costs being certified to the
property and placed upon the tax rolls.
   (B)   The building inspector and his or her authorized representative are
empowered to cause any building, other structure or tract of land to be
inspected and examined, and to order in writing the remedying of any condition
found to exist therein or threat in violation of any provisions of this title.
After any such order has been served, no work shall proceed on any building,
other structure or tract of land covered by such order, except to correct or
comply with such order. This title shall not be construed to hold the City
responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of the inspection
or reinspection authorized herein or failure to inspect or reinspect or by
reason of issuing a building permit as herein provided.
