assessment. The running of limitations provided by this section shall be
suspended during the stay pending the appeal, and for thirty (30) days

safety officer may prescribe the actions which the animal owner must take to
abate the nuisance or to protect the public from the menacing characteristics
of an animal so designated. Such restrictions may include additional fencing,

officer can be assured that the insecurity which allowed the animal to go free
has been remedied and will remain so. If any declared vicious animal is found

farm or other appropriate facility that will accept such animals. The

11-1-10: PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION:
Provided that the context does not give rise to practical difficulties,
interpretations of certain zoning ordinance language and certain standards will
usually be applied in the following manner:
   A.   Buildings Across Parcel Description Lines: Provided legal and
contiguous parcels of record are owned by the same property owner(s), building
(s) that have been developed across property lines shall merge the properties
into one parcel for the determination of zoning standards.
   B.   Fences And Wall Height Measurement: Maximum fence and wall height shall
be measured from the finished grade at the property line. That portion of a
wall or fence functioning as a retaining wall shall not be counted in
determining overall fence or wall height.
   C.   Yard Orientation On Through Lots: On through lots, where public road
frontage at both ends exists, either line may be designated by the
Administrator as the front yard; however, the predominate orientation of
existing structures and the presence of street access limitations on that block
shall determine the front of the structure.
   D.   Setback Encroachments: Setbacks shall not be less than the minimum
dimension specified in the specific section, except for cornices, canopies,
eaves, or other similar architectural features not providing additional floor
space within the building may extend into a required side, front or rear yard
setback no more than three feet (3'). Setbacks will be measured from the
property line to the foundation of the structure. A minimum of five feet (5')
separation is required between adjacent building overhangs, canopies, etc.
Paved, uncovered parking is generally allowed in setback areas, unless other
restrictions provide to the contrary.
   E.   Interpretation Of District Boundaries: Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning districts as shown on the
official zoning map, the following shall apply:
      1.   Where zone boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
centerline of street or highway right-of-way lines, streams, lakes or other
bodies of water, the centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. Where
the zoning boundary follows a railroad right-of-way, such boundary shall be
deemed to be located in the center of the right-of-way, unless otherwise
clearly designated.
      2.   Where zone boundaries approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be the boundaries.
      3.   Where zone boundaries are approximately parallel to the centerlines
or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines of
highways, such zone boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and
at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official zoning map. If no
distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale
shown on the official zoning map. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)

CHAPTER 4
ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS -
ADOPTION AND AMENDMENT OF ZONING MAP
SECTION:
11-4-1: Establishment Of Zoning Districts
11-4-2: Effect Of Zoning
11-4-3: Residential Zones
11-4-4: Commercial Zones
11-4-5: Industrial Zones
11-4-6: Planned Unit Development
11-4-7: Public Uses
11-4-8: Official Zoning Map
11-4-1: ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS:
In order to classify, regulate, restrict, and segregate the uses of lands and
buildings from incompatible uses, to allow uses where public infrastructure is
sufficient to support such uses, to regulate and restrict the height, bulk and
construction of buildings, to regulate the dimensions and area of yards and
other open spaces around buildings and uses, to implement the policies of the
comprehensive plan, and to regulate the intensity of land use and the density
of residences, the zoning districts set forth herein are established and shall
be applied as depicted upon the adopted official zoning map of the
jurisdiction. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-2: EFFECT OF ZONING:
The regulations for each district set forth by this title are minimum
regulations and shall apply to each type of land use, except as otherwise
provided. No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied and no
building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with the
regulations specified in these regulations for the zoning district in which it
is located. No building or other structure shall be erected or altered to
provide for greater height or bulk, accommodate, or house a greater number of
residential units, or to occupy a greater percentage of lot area than allowed
by this title. No yard area or lot existing at the time of passage of this
title shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set
forth in this title. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this
title shall meet at least the minimum requirements set forth in this title.
Uses and structures lawfully existing on the date of adoption of this title may
continue so long as they are not changed in ways that conflict with provisions
of this title. No aspect of nonconformity may be expanded contrary to the
provisions of this title, except by means of variance or special exception. The
uses allowed by zoning districts are exclusive. Only land uses authorized by
this title or by administrative application of provisions of this title may be
established in the land use zones depicted on the official zoning map. The
descriptions of types of land use zones addressed by this title are intended to
explain, in general terms, how zones will be applied to implement the
comprehensive plan. The specific entries in the use and bulk and placement
matrices are intended to identify specific uses that fit within the general
descriptions set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-3: RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
Residential (R) zones are intended to provide a living environment that
supports a place for families and individuals to live with limited adverse
influence from commercial or industrial activity and to permit other accessory
uses that are associated and compatible with residential use. Certain
residential zones may be established that allow higher residential densities,
and hence higher activity levels, but always with the goal of enjoyment of a
residential environment. Residential zones are primarily applied in the areas
designated residential in the Comprehensive Plan. Permitted uses, conditionally
permitted uses and lot area and building bulk and placement requirements shall
comport with the standards set forth in the zoning matrix contained in this
title. A primary distinction between low density and higher density residential
neighborhoods should be the ability of community infrastructure to accommodate
higher levels of activity without creating undue congestion, without unduly
stressing utility systems that support development and without compromising the
quality of public facilities available to provide public service. Class A
manufactured homes are allowed to be used for single-family residential
purposes within all residential zoning districts.
   A.   The following residential districts are hereby established. Each of
these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside
there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live,
sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in
nonresidential districts:
      1.   R-S Residential/Suburban: This district is designed to accommodate
low density, single-family residential and suburban type development in areas
within the City's planning jurisdiction that are not yet appropriate for
development of higher densities or more intensive use.
      2.   R-1 Single-Family Residential: This district is designed primarily
to accommodate single-family detached residential uses at medium densities in
areas served by public water and sewer facilities. Two-family residences are
allowed only through a planned unit development.
      3.   R-2 Multi-Family Residential: This district is designed to
accommodate single-family detached and two-family detached and two-family
attached dwelling units.
      4.   R-3 Multi-Family Residential: This district is designed primarily to
accommodate higher density multi-family, manufactured housing community, and
neighborhood business developments. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-4: COMMERCIAL ZONES:
Commercial (C) land use zones are intended to support uses that include retail
sales and services for households and traveling consumers by allowing a variety
of retail, professional, or service businesses. Businesses involving the
manufacture, processing, or fabrication of goods or providing service or repair
to commercial products or equipment are not generally permitted unless
activities can be conducted within buildings that can thrive in the midst of
commercial infrastructure. Commercial zones are to be applied in areas
identified by the text and mapping of the Comprehensive Plan as being suitable
for commercial business, primarily addressing lands located near arterial and
collector streets. Residential uses may be allowed within commercial zones by
special use permit when the presence of housing will not compromise present or
future commercial uses or when the housing environment within the commercial
zone will not be unsuitable for residential occupancy by virtue of congestion,
environmental factors, or activity levels. Uses permitted by right in the
industrial zone may be conditionally allowed in certain commercial zones by
special use permit so long as no industrial activities or processes are
conducted outdoors or in a manner that creates adverse environmental effects.
   A.   The following districts are hereby established to accomplish the
purposes and objectives set forth as follows:
      1.   C-B Central Business: This district is designed to accommodate a
wide variety of commercial activities, particularly those that are pedestrian
oriented, that will result in the most intensive and attractive use of the
City's Central Business District. No off street parking is required.
      2.   C-1 Office/Professional: This district is designed to accommodate a
mixture of less intensive commercial activities, such as office, clerical,
research, services, etc., and multi-family residential uses. Such areas will
generally constitute transition or buffer zones between major arterial rights-
of-way or more intensively developed commercial areas and residential
districts.
      3.   C-2 General Commercial: This district is designed to accommodate the
widest range of commercial activities. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-5: INDUSTRIAL ZONES:
The industrial zones permit light industrial uses such as warehousing,
assembly, processing and light manufacturing as permitted uses and
conditionally allows heavy industrial uses such as fabrication, manufacturing,
refining and processes that produce external effects such as noise, emissions,
outside activities by special use permit. The industrial zones are primarily
applied in areas designated suitable for industrial development by the text and
future land use map of the Comprehensive Plan. Residential uses may only be
established in an industrial zone if subordinate and accessory to a primary
industrial use and should be permitted only by a conditional use permit.
   A.   The following districts are hereby established to accommodate uses
engaged in the manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating,
painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment:
      1.   M-1 Light Industrial: This district is designed to accommodate
industrial and manufacturing activities that can be accomplished entirely
within an enclosed building and can provide a buffer between commercial/
residential districts and more intensive manufacturing developments.
      2.   M-2 Industrial: This district is designed to accommodate the widest
range of industrial and manufacturing activities. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-6: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
A planned unit development (PUD) is an overlay district that, when approved,
may overlay in any of the community's zoning districts. This district overlay
is designed to guide major developments of land and structures to achieve a
measure of choice and flexibility in development pattern within the confines of
the regulations contained in this title. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-7: PUBLIC USES:
Land uses to be established by public agencies may be permitted in accordance
with the land use tables adopted as part of this title. Any such use shall be
subject to provisions of State and Federal law. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-4-8: OFFICIAL ZONING MAP:
The zones established in this title shall be applied as depicted on the
Official Zoning Map which is hereby incorporated into this title by reference
as it exists today or as modified by the text of subsequent amending
ordinances. The Administrator shall maintain the Official Zoning Map to reflect
changes made by the City Council from time to time and shall depict such
changes on the Official Zoning Map. Each change shall be documented at the time
the map is modified, including reference to the ordinances authorizing changes.
A register of such changes including descriptions of the lands affected thereby
shall be maintained by the Administrator throughout the duration of the
existence of the Official Zoning Map, until it is superseded by a replacement
zoning map. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
CHAPTER 5
LAND USE TABLES
SECTION:
11-5-1: Adoption Of Land Use Tables - Purpose
11-5-2: Interpretation Of Land Use Tables
11-5-3: Table Of Uses
11-5-1: ADOPTION OF LAND USE TABLES - PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to identify permitted and conditionally
permitted land uses within Kellogg in order to foster compatibility with uses
in the same land use designations and to promote a measure of protection
against the intrusion of the effects of incompatible land uses. The use of land
is characterized by the activity for which the building, improvements, or lot
is designed, configured, conducted, occupied, or maintained. A land use that
will not operate for more than thirty (30) days in any calendar year should be
considered a temporary use, subject to the requirements governing temporary
uses. Unless a temporary use permit has been approved pursuant to ordinances of
the City, establishment of any land use will be presumed to require compliance
with all applicable provisions of this title. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-5-2: INTERPRETATION OF LAND USE TABLES:
Matrix-style land use tables that address allowable uses and building bulk and
placement standards are made part of this title and shall be interpreted
consistent with the principles and rules set forth in this section.
   A.   If the letter "P", for "permitted", appears in the box at the
intersection of a column and a row, the use is allowed in that classification,
subject to the development and operational requirements of this and other
applicable provisions of this title.
   B.   If the letter "C", for "conditionally permitted", appears in the box at
the intersection of a column and a row, the use is conditionally allowed in
that classification, subject to obtaining a conditional use permit and subject
to the development and operational requirements of this and other applicable
provisions of this title. The responsibility of demonstrating that a special
use permit request is appropriate rests with the applicant.
   C.   Uses not designated as permitted (P) or conditionally permitted (C) are
prohibited. If neither a "P" or "C" appears in the box at the intersection of a
column and a row, the use is prohibited in the zoning classification.
   D.   The land use tables in this section indicate whether a specific use is
allowed in a zone classification. Specific uses are divided among multiple
tables, each of which represents a broad category of land uses.
   E.   Any proposed use not listed in the table may be classified by the
Administrator as a permitted use (P), conditional use (C), or prohibited, based
on the listed use(s) to which the proposed use is most similar. If the
Administrator determines that the proposed use is not similar to any use in the
table, the proposed use shall not be permitted. The Administrator may use the
land based classification system (LBCS) as a basis for comparing the nature of
a proposed or identified use. The determination of the Administrator may be
appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission as provided herein.
   F.   LBCS codes are provided for many land uses and can aid in categorizing
of proposed land uses by the Administrator. The American Planning Association
can be accessed on the internet for an explanation of LBCS codes, and
additional help in categorizing land uses. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)

PUBLIC HEARINGS
SECTION:
11-7-1: Public Hearings - Purpose
11-7-2: Public Hearing - When Required
11-7-3: Public Hearing Notice
11-7-4: Alternative Public Hearing Notification
11-7-5: Public Hearing Procedures - Required
11-7-6: Decisions By The Planning And Zoning Commission And City Council - Form
11-7-7: Appeals
11-7-8: Reconsideration
11-7-1: PUBLIC HEARINGS - PURPOSE:
Public hearings are distinguished from ordinary public meetings by expressly
allowing active public participation in the planning and zoning process. The
purpose of the public hearing process is to gather information from the public
concerning issues relevant to making a decision concerning particular issues
and requests. Public hearing opportunities are governed by public hearing
procedures adopted by resolution of the City Council and are subject to
management by the Chairman of the meeting at which the public hearing occurs.
Public hearing procedures provide general guidelines and may be varied in order
to allow orderly decision-making that respects the interests of all parties
concerned with a proposal or request. Legislative hearings are conducted to
obtain general public comment about proposals to change planning and zoning
law. Quasi-judicial hearings address site specific applications for permits or
approvals and must maintain due process protections for all with qualified
interests. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-2: PUBLIC HEARING - WHEN REQUIRED:
The purpose of a public hearing is to give potentially affected persons an
opportunity to offer oral testimony in support of or in opposition to an
application or proposal. The resultant opinions and evidence submitted create
part of the record upon which the decision-makers must base their decisions.
Any of the following planning and zoning activities will be required to hold a
public hearing or hearings in accordance with the applicable requirements of
State law. If any provision of this title conflicts with State law, provisions
of State law shall prevail.
   A.   Zoning Ordinance Text And Map Amendments And Zoning District Overlays:
These procedures require a mandatory public hearing before the Planning and
Zoning Commission and an optional public hearing before the City Council. The
City Council shall render decisions concerning zoning ordinance text and map
amendments either by passing an amending ordinance or declining to do so.
   B.   Variances: Variances require a public hearing before the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall render decisions
concerning variance applications, subject to appeal to the City Council.
   C.   Conditional (Special) Use Permits: Conditional use permits require a
public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission. The commission shall
render decisions concerning special use permit applications, subject to appeal
to the City Council.
   D.   Planned Unit Development (PUD): PUD permits require one public hearing
before the Planning and Zoning Commission and an optional public hearing before
the City Council. PUD permits are to be decided by the City Council after
receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   E.   Zoning Designation Upon Annexation: Zoning upon annexation requires
public hearings before the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council.
The City Council shall decide zoning designation(s) upon annexation after a
Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation has been received and the City
Council has conducted its hearing. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-3: PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE:
Prior to any required public hearing, notice shall be provided as required by
law. The jurisdiction will administer provision of public notice at the
applicant's expense. The applicant may be required to supply an ownership
report prepared by an Idaho-licensed title company containing all current
property owners in order to provide required notice. Any such obligation shall
conform to the administrative direction provided by the Administrator. (Ord.
595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-4: ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC HEARING NOTIFICATION:
When public hearing notification is required for two hundred (200) or more
property owners or purchasers of record and for Comprehensive Plan and zone
ordinance text amendments, the alternative procedure for official notice
provided in Idaho Code 67-6511, or its successor, shall be given. The applicant
shall bear the cost of alternative public hearing notice as determined by the
Administrator. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-5: PUBLIC HEARING PROCEDURES - REQUIRED:
Public hearing procedures shall be established by resolution of the City
Council consistent with State law.
   A.   For public hearings associated with changes to the comprehensive plan,
amending the zoning map, amending the subdivision or related ordinances, or
considering changes to other land use ordinances for which a hearing is
required by State law, there shall be at least one public hearing required,
such hearing(s) to be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission, with an
additional hearing to be conducted by the City Council upon its decision to do
so.
   B.   For public hearings concerning conditional use permit applications,
variances, planned unit developments, there shall be one public hearing
required, such hearing to be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
City Council may schedule an additional public hearing concerning such matters
if jurisdiction for a decision, by appeal or otherwise, comes to the City
Council. Such hearing is optional based upon the discretion of the City
Council. Whenever Idaho Code authorizes the use of a hearing examiner, the City
Council may approve a resolution or motion authorizing use of a hearing
examiner as an alternative to the Planning and Zoning Commission whenever it
deems such use to be appropriate. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-6: DECISIONS BY THE PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL -
FORM:
All decisions made by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council shall
be made in a manner and form consistent with the requirements of Idaho law.
Decisions that are deemed quasi-judicial shall identify the standards and
criteria, relevant facts and provisions of law that lead to the conclusion
reached. In recognition that such requirements may change from time to time by
virtue of judicial decision and legislative enactment, decision-makers are
referred to relevant provisions of State law for guidance in shaping decisions
required by this title. All decisions that are deemed legislative decisions by
requirements of State law shall be undertaken in the same manner that
legislative decisions are typically made. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-7-7: APPEALS:
An appeal is a request challenging the propriety of a land use decision or
interpretation of the zoning ordinance by the Administrator, the Planning and
Zoning Commission or a hearing examiner if one should be employed. Fees
governing appeals must be paid and the legal basis for appeals must be stated
in writing before an appeal will be deemed accepted for consideration. Appeals
will follow the procedures specified below. An appeal that has not been
perfected by payment of fees or statement of issues may be dismissed in the
sound discretion of the City Council.
   A.   Appeals of final decisions made by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or hearing examiner shall follow procedures established by City Council
resolution. Any such appeal shall include the specific legal basis for appeal
and the result sought through the appellate process. Employing whatever
procedures it deems appropriate in accordance with its procedures resolution,
the City Council will render a written, reasoned decision that will be
communicated to the appellant and/or applicant as required by law.
   B.   Appeals of decisions made by the Administrator shall use procedures
established by City Council resolution. Any such appeal shall include the
specific legal basis for appeal and the result sought through the appellate
process. Employing whatever procedures it deems appropriate in accordance with
the City Council's procedures resolution, the Planning and Zoning Commission or
the City Council will render a written, reasoned decision that will be
communicated to the appellant and/or applicant as required by law. (Ord. 595,
6-13-2018)
11-7-8: RECONSIDERATION:
Reconsideration is a procedure by which an applicant or other affected person
seeks to have a final decision-maker revisit the outcome or rationale of a
quasi-judicial land-use decision. Any applicant or affected person seeking
judicial review of compliance with the provisions of this section must first
seek reconsideration of the final decision within fourteen (14) days. Such
written request must identify specific deficiencies in the decision for which
reconsideration is sought. Upon reconsideration, the decision may be affirmed,
reversed or modified after compliance with applicable procedural standards. A
written decision shall be provided to the applicant or affected person within
sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for reconsideration or the request is
deemed denied. A decision shall not be deemed final for purposes of judicial
review unless the process required in this subsection has been followed. The
twenty eight (28) day time frame for seeking judicial review is tolled until
the date of the written decision regarding reconsideration or the expiration of
the sixty (60) day reconsideration period, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 595,
6-13-2018)

PROCEDURES
SECTION:
11-8-1: Amendment Of Zoning Map
11-8-2: Amendment Of The Text Of The Land Use Regulations
11-8-1: AMENDMENT OF ZONING MAP:
The City Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission or hearing examiner, may amend, by ordinance, the boundaries of the
zoning district classifications of lands in accordance with applicable
provisions of Idaho Code and this title. Amendments to the zoning map should
generally be in accordance with goals and policies of the Kellogg Comprehensive
Plan.
   A.   Any application for a zoning map amendment or to apply zoning upon
annexation shall include the information required by the application forms
supplied by the Administrator, the information required by State law and
information otherwise required by this title or by the Administrator,
commission, hearing examiner, or City Council. In addition to information
required by the application form, an application to change zoning district
boundaries shall provide a description of the amendment or zoning requested
along with a statement that describes the rationale for the request, how it
would better implement the Comprehensive Plan, and the public purpose that
would be achieved by amendment of the zoning map. All applications for zoning
map amendments or zoning upon annexation shall be submitted to the Planning and
Zoning Commission or to the designated hearing examiner, which shall recommend
action to the City Council who may adopt, modify, or reject the proposed
amendment.
   B.   Upon granting or denying an application to amend the zoning map, the
City Council shall explain its rationale for doing so, making reference to
ordinance standards and comprehensive plan policies relied upon in evaluating
the application and stating the reasons for approval or denial. An amendment,
if approved, shall be implemented by the passage of an ordinance or as
otherwise required by law. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-8-2: AMENDMENT OF THE TEXT OF THE LAND USE REGULATIONS:
The City Council may amend or repeal the regulations, restrictions and/or
zoning classifications that are made applicable by this title. Proposals to
change the text of land use regulations (zoning ordinance) shall follow the
procedures set forth in the Local Land Use Planning Act. Such proposals may be
initiated by the City Council, by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by a
petition from a resident or landowner within the City. A non-site-specific
amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance is a legislative action subject
to procedural standards applicable to legislative action. In the interest of
procedural economy, any request to amend the text of the zoning ordinance,
except one that originates from the City Council or Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall first be referred to the City Council before initiating the
hearing procedure. If the City Council determines, based upon the face of a
request for amendment transmitted to it, that it does not wish to entertain a
particular request, the request may be returned to the requestor and shall not
move forward unless the party proposing the request agrees to pre-pay all
estimated costs of processing the request to its conclusion. In such instance
any procedural time limits established by local law shall be deemed suspended
and the request shall be considered as time allows.
   A.   The City Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning
and Zoning Commission or hearing examiner, may amend, by ordinance, the text of
this title in accordance with applicable provisions of Idaho Code and the
City's Comprehensive Plan.
   B.   Any application for a zoning ordinance text amendment shall address the
questions posed by the application forms supplied by the Administrator, the
information required by State law and information otherwise required by this
title or by the Administrator, commission, hearing examiner, or City Council.
In addition to information required by the application form, an application to
change the text of the zoning ordinance shall provide a description of the
amendment requested along with a statement that describes the rationale for the
request, the proposed text of the amendment, how it would better implement the
Comprehensive Plan, and the public purpose that would be achieved by amendment
of the zoning ordinance. All applications for zoning ordinance text amendments
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission which shall recommend
action to the City Council, who may adopt, modify, or reject the proposed
amendment. An amendment, if approved, shall be implemented by the passage of an
ordinance. A non-site-specific amendment of the text of the zoning ordinance is
a legislative act committed to the sound discretion of the City Council. (Ord.

11-9-1: CONDITIONAL (SPECIAL) USE PERMITS:
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and a framework of
procedures for consideration of requests for conditional use permits.
Conditional uses are not permitted by right in a particular zoning district but
may be authorized following a public hearing provided that they comply with the
standards established by the ordinance. "Conditional use" as used in this title
is the same as "special use" referenced in Idaho Code section 67-6512, as such
code provision exists at the time of enactment of this title. A conditional use
permit is not transferable from one parcel of land to another, nor shall it be
considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other conditional use
permits in similar locations or circumstances. As its name implies, a
conditional use permit may be issued subject to performance or compliance with
conditions as outlined in this title and as addressed by the specific proposal
or application and as found necessary by the decision makers.
   A.   Procedures: Conditional use permit requests require a public hearing
before the Planning and Zoning Commission (hearing examiner) following
appropriate procedures. Notice shall comply with legal requirements established
by Idaho Code. Any decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission may be
appealed to the City Council by an affected person within no more than fourteen
(14) days after the final written decision of the Planning and Zoning
Commission has been rendered. Any such request to appeal must be signed by the
appellant and received by the Administrator within the time constraints
established by this title. An appeal not timely filed shall be dismissed.
Failure to appeal a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission to the City
Council shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant
to this title.
   B.   Application Required: A completed conditional use permit application
shall be submitted to the Administrator which shall include, among other
matters addressed by the application form, a description of the use proposed,
the manner of implementation of the proposed use including information about
appearance, materials to be used and configuration, how it would be compatible
with infrastructure and land uses, present and future, and why the proposal
would be in the public interest and not unduly burden or hamper the delivery of
services or the public.
   C.   Hearing And Standards Of Decision: As its schedule and agenda allow the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a public hearing and shall
consider testimony and other evidence and review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed conditional use. In considering a conditional
use request, the Planning and Zoning Commission may attach appropriate
conditions to mitigate impacts and to ensure conformance with the intent of the
Comprehensive Plan and applicable provisions of this title. An application for
a conditional use permit may be approved as presented, conditionally approved,
or denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon determining the following:
      1.   Whether the proposed conditional use would/would not conform with
the purposes and express terms of the applicable zoning district in which it
would be located.
      2.   Whether the proposed use constitutes an allowable conditional use as
established by this chapter for the zoning district involved; and complies with
all other applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the jurisdiction and
the State.
      3.   Whether the proposed conditional use as presented will/will not be
compatible with the health, safety, and welfare of the public in general and
with present or future land uses in the vicinity of the proposal.
      4.   Whether the proposed special use will/will not further positive
development of the vicinity in accordance with relevant policies set forth in
the comprehensive plan and land use ordinances.
   D.   Conditions: When granting a conditional use permit, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may attach conditions and requirements specific to the
proposal including, but not limited to:
      1.   Minimizing conflicts with present or future development.
      2.   Controlling the sequence and timing of development.
      3.   Controlling the duration of development.
      4.   Assuring that development is maintained properly.
      5.   Controlling the location and setbacks of development.
      6.   Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required
in the zoning ordinance for uses permitted outright. Such more-restrictive
standards may include but not be limited to: additional setbacks, requiring
development within time limitations, height restrictions, additional
landscaping or screening, lighting restrictions, signage restrictions,
selection of building or hardscape materials, location of site accesses,
location of site features, prescribing site layout, circulation or grading,
restricting hours of operation or activity, design limitations, circulation
limits for vehicles or pedestrians, control of site drainage or area wide
drainage patterns, prescribing specific use limitations and such other features
of use or site development as may be needed to enhance compatibility with use
of surrounding lands and public facilities.
   E.   Written Decision Required: Whenever granting or denying an application
for a conditional use permit, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall render
its decision in writing.
   F.   Permits And Progress Required: Unless expressly allowed to the contrary
by the terms of a conditional use permit, if permits for development of a
requested conditional use have not been issued within six (6) months of the
date of granting a conditional use permit or if development of the approved
special use has not commenced with sustained effort to complete development
within one year after granting approval of the conditional use permit, the
conditional use permit shall become null and void, unless the Planning and
Zoning Commission or City Council, whichever gave final approval, has granted
an extension, such extension not to exceed twelve (12) months upon a showing of
good cause by the applicant. An extension to the permit may only be granted if
applied for in writing to the City Clerk prior to the date of expiration and if
the approving body finds, upon review of the record, that an extension is
warranted due to unique and unforeseeable circumstances outside the control of
the applicant.
   G.   Violation - Revocation Or Penalty: Any conditional use that operates in
violation of the requirements or conditions established for a conditional use
permit, pursuant to this chapter, may be revoked and the use restricted,
suspended, and/or be subject to penalties for violation of this title. (Ord.
595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-2: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD):
A planned unit development (PUD) is a process that allows a measure of design
flexibility by permitting variation of the distribution of land use density,
variation of building placement standards, individual lot area, lot frontage
requirements, access requirements, and variation of other performance standards
required within a zoning district or combination of zoning districts when a
development is planned in its entirety and when the variations can be
demonstrated to benefit the development for those who will reside and conduct
business affairs within the proposed development and for the community in
general. The intent of the PUD process is to allow innovation in design that
should prove superior to compliance with standard development requirements that
are not the product of site-specific integrated design.
   A.   A combination of residential, commercial, or industrial land uses may
be permitted within a PUD. Any such mixed use planned unit development must
follow the same procedures as those required for a change of zoning district
boundaries.
   B.   Proposed uses and manner of implementation of such uses may be
permitted within a PUD, upon finding that the proposal:
      1.   Provides internal or external benefits that would not be achievable
through compliance with the normally required zoning standards and regulations.
      2.   Is and will be compatible with surrounding land uses, both existing
and future.
      3.   Furthers compliance with the goals and policies found within the
Kellogg Comprehensive Plan.
   C.   A PUD that includes residential land use must provide open space of not
less than ten percent (10%) of the gross land area designated for residential
land use within project boundaries for the benefit of residents of the project
or for benefit of the community in general. The location and design of common
open space should be practical and usable for outdoor activities. Common open
space provided in a PUD may be held and maintained privately for the use of
owners or residents within the development, and/or may be designated as open
for shared public use. Public utility rights-of-way and easements are generally
not acceptable for common open space unless such land or rights-of-way are
unimpaired as a trail or other similar benefit to the PUD or public. Public
rights-of-way, utility sites easements, or service areas may be required by the
City as part of the approval. The responsibility for and the method of
maintaining common open spaces shall be identified by the applicant as a facet
of approval of any final PUD development plan and placed into the development
agreement.
   D.   Planned unit developments that include a subdivision may be considered
concurrently as a subdivision and PUD.
   E.   The application for a PUD shall include a general design layout of the
entire parcel in question, prototypical elevations, and footprints for
structures other than detached single-family homes. General principles of
landscape design, streetscapes, nonresidential layouts, and general design
features must be included.
   F.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review a proposed planned unit
development and conduct a public hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall determine if the proposed PUD complies with the requirements of this
title and forward a recommendation to the City Council. The criteria to be
applied to such review are:
      1.   Standards applicable to conditional use permits.
      2.   General concepts of community design.
      3.   Achieving compatibility and buffering internally and with
neighboring uses.
      4.   Demonstrate design techniques preferable to strict adherence to the
City land use regulations.
      5.   Demonstrate that the proposed PUD will enhance public health and
safety.
   G.   The City Council, upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning
and Zoning Commission, may review the record and determine whether to hold a
subsequent public hearing or decide whether to approve, modify, or disapprove
the proposed preliminary PUD. After City Council approval, if granted, the
applicant and staff shall complete a development agreement for the PUD using
the approved development plans as a primary element of the development
agreement. Such development agreement shall outline the obligations of the
developer to the extent that they represent a departure from typical ordinance
requirements. Construction standards must comply with adopted standards unless
expressly authorized by the terms of PUD approval. The form and manner of the
development agreement shall be as specified in the Kellogg subdivision
ordinance under master development agreements.
   H.   The approved plans for the planned unit development shall contain
sufficient detail and necessary specifications to construct the project. Among
the elements of the plans are:
      1.   A plan of the existing site of the proposed development showing the
dimensions and bearings of the property lines, topography, existing features of
the development site; including major wooded areas, structures, streets,
easements, utility lines and land uses.
      2.   Engineered construction plans for water, sewer, storm drainage,
street improvements, and the nature and extent of earth work required for site
preparation and development.
      3.   Scalable plans, showing building(s) and their placement, various
functional use areas, common open space, circulation details, and landscaping.
      4.   Preliminary building plans including exterior elevations.
      5.   Phasing plans that depict the scope of each phase and a timetable
for implementation.
      6.   Project documents to be used to designate the use, development, and
maintenance of the land, and the improvements thereon, including those areas
that are to be commonly owned and maintained. The intent of designating such
responsibility shall not be included within the scope of the jurisdiction's
enforcement authority but rather to determine where responsibility lies for
maintaining compliance with terms of approval of any planned unit development.
   I.   Each individual phase of the development, as well as the total
development, must be capable of existing as an independent unit capable of
creating an environment of desirable aesthetics or that adequate assurance will
be provided that such objective will be attained. Individual phases of any such
development must conform to the overall density and use considerations required
by the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance and its comprehensive plan. Any
exception from standard zoning district requirements must be justified by
design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plans, in
accordance with the preliminary PUD and adopted policy of the City Council as
set forth in the comprehensive plan. The applicant must also satisfy the
standards applicable to subdivisions of land set forth in title 12,
"Subdivisions", of this Code. Final PUD plans must conform to the approved
preliminary PUD plans.
   J.   No construction of any kind shall take place on the site of an approved
PUD until final construction plans are reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer and a development agreement between the City and the developer is
executed.
   K.   The approval of a final development plan for the PUD or first phase of
a PUD shall be for a period not to exceed one year, or as expressly authorized
in a development agreement approved by the City Council. The approved time
period for planned unit development construction may be extended once for no
more than twelve (12) additional months by the Administrator or for a maximum
of two (2) years by action of the City Council.
   L.   Any modification of an approved planned unit development must be
submitted in writing by the applicant to the Administrator. The request shall
specify what modifications are proposed and why the changes are necessary. The
Administrator will determine whether the proposed modification is minor or
major. If the modification is minor, the Administrator will approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove the modification in writing, subject to
confirmation by the City Council. Any major modification will require a public
hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with procedures
specified by this title.
   M.   Development of land through a PUD for residential, commercial, or
industrial uses shall be required to comply with subdivision regulations and
other jurisdiction ordinances as applicable. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-3: VARIANCE:
A variance is a discretionary exception to the requirements of the zoning
ordinance concerning bulk and placement standards such as lot area, lot
coverage, width, depth, setbacks, parking location requirements, height, or any
other ordinance provision affecting the size of a structure or the placement of
the structure upon the property. Variances may be permitted when, due to
unusual natural physical characteristics of the site, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship denying an
owner all reasonable use of the owner's land. An applicant for a variance bears
the responsibility for demonstrating an undue hardship because of unique
physical characteristics of the site, and after meeting that obligation must
demonstrate that the implemented variance would not harm the public interest.
   A.   A complete application using an application form supplied by the
Administrator shall include a site plan, a verbal description of the variance
requested, reasons why the variance is warranted, and any supporting documents.
The application will be scheduled for public hearing whenever it can be
accommodated by the schedule of the hearing body.
   B.   At least one public hearing must be held before the Planning and Zoning
Commission using the hearing and notice procedure required by State law.
   C.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the following when
deciding a variance request:
      1.   Whether application of the provisions of this Code would deprive the
applicant of all reasonable use of his land.
      2.   That special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to
the natural conditions of the land in ways not generally applicable to other
lands in the community.
      3.   Whether the variance, if granted, would harm the public interest by
adversely affecting public safety, the environment, or the legitimate interests
of neighboring owners.
   D.   When granting or denying an application, the commission shall specify
the relevant facts considered in evaluating the application, the reasons for
approval or denial, and the actions, if any, that the applicant could take to
obtain a permit. The applicant will be notified of the decision in writing. A
variance decision may be appealed to the City Council within fourteen (14) days
of final action by the Planning and Zoning Commission by an applicant or other
affected person. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-4: TEMPORARY USE PERMITS:
A temporary use is a land use established for a period of time not to exceed
ninety (90) days in a calendar year and does not require permanent site
improvements. The actual use embodied by a temporary use permit must be a
permitted use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located. The
temporary use permit may be allowed subject to conditions required by the
Administrator so long as the Administrator determines that granting the
temporary use permit will not harm the public interest if the required
conditions are complied with.
   A.   Temporary uses may be allowed in appropriately zoned areas without full
site development as otherwise required by this title. Such uses may include,
but are not limited to, erection of temporary structures such as tents, fences,
booths or parking of trailers for activities such as carnivals, circuses,
fairs, religious meetings, temporary outdoor displays and/or sale of Christmas
trees, art objects or other items and other similar activities conducted either
outdoors or within temporary structures.
   B.   An application for a temporary use shall include a written description
of the use, proposed starting date of the use, and a site plan that shows the
location of the use, access, setbacks from property lines, parking, restroom
facilities (if applicable), and any other pertinent information that the
Administrator may require to evaluate the use. An application for a temporary
use with a duration in excess of thirty (30) days shall include the names and
addresses of abutting land owners. The Administrator will prepare a notice of
the administrative permit request and mail it to abutting property owners who
will have seven (7) days from the date of mailing within which to respond with
written comments supporting or opposing the request. Notice of the proposal may
also be sent to City operating departments, agencies providing service or
affected agencies for comment.
   C.   A temporary use may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied by
the Administrator. A temporary use permit is valid on the date of approval or
on the date requested by the applicant and will be valid for the time period
requested but no more than ninety (90) days during a calendar year, such days
to be designated at the time of issuance. The Administrator, when deciding a
temporary use permit request, should consider the following:
      1.   Whether the proposed temporary use would be consistent with the
general policies of the zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan.
      2.   Whether the use would otherwise be permitted within the zoning
district wherein located.
      3.   Whether granting the temporary use permit would be detrimental to
the nearby neighborhood or to the community in general.
      4.   Whether the proposed temporary use would create a traffic hazard.
      5.   Whether the proposed temporary use would impair the functioning of
community facilities or delivery of public services. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-5: SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS:
The site plan review process is intended to require new multi-family
residential, commercial, and industrial development to comply with applicable
provisions of land use and development ordinances in the context of practical
realties of each development site. Site plan review and approval is required
for the initial establishment or location of any commercial, industrial, public
or multi-family residential (greater than 4 units on 1 parcel) building or use,
or the expansion of floor area of an existing non- residential building by more
than thirty three percent (33%).
   A.   An application for site plan review approval shall be filed with the
Administrator in conjunction with, or prior to, application for a building
permit. The Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete
for review, a process that can be facilitated by a pre-application meeting with
jurisdiction staff. In addition to application requirements otherwise required
by this title or the applicable Building Code, a site plan submitted for review
should include:
      1.   A scaled drawing of the proposed, developed site depicting placement
of all buildings, parking areas, circulation patterns, landscaped areas,
signage, building bulk information, drainage patterns and locations, utility
service information and such other information as the Administrator might
require to assess the impact of development of a site upon the land and
infrastructure affected.
      2.   Location and empirical information about the site including the size
of the site in square feet or acres, the address of the site, if known, and the
assessors parcel identification number, the area of the lot covered by
buildings in square feet, square feet of impervious surface and the density in
units per acre for residential developments.
   B.   The applicant shall provide three (3) copies of site plans for review,
drawn to an appropriate scale to clearly show all required elements that
include but are not limited to location and height of existing and proposed
structures, signs, trash enclosures, site furnishings, and site lighting, site
boundaries and dimensions, spot elevations at the property corners and enough
site information from adjoining properties so that differences in site grading
can be addressed. Elevations should be sufficient to determine water flow to,
from and on the site, setbacks from property lines, existing or proposed
easements, location of existing and proposed utility structures and location
and size of existing and proposed sewer and water lines, location of the
nearest fire hydrant(s), location of all driveways, streets and sidewalks,
location and layout of all off- street parking, and location of loading areas
(if applicable), site grading and drainage to include stormwater collection and
treatment, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, architect or landscape
architect, registered in the State of Idaho.
   C.   The Administrator may waive any of the requirements listed above upon
determining they are unnecessary based on the scope of work proposed. The site
plan review process is intended to provide a degree of flexibility in the
application of standards and ordinance requirements to allow site design to
function with its surroundings, while maintaining compliance with ordinance
requirements.
   D.   Upon receipt of a complete site plan review application, the
Administrator may schedule a site plan review with other members of City staff
and those from other agencies. Copies of submitted documents will be shared as
necessary with outside agencies and jurisdictions and neighboring property
owners that may be affected by the proposed use. The Administrator and
appropriate staff will review the site plan submittals to determine that all
applicable ordinance provisions are complied with and that the site will
function satisfactorily in the context of its surroundings. Site plan review
may include but not be limited to:
      1.   Review of lot dimensions, setbacks and other site development
characteristics to determine functional compatibility with topography, public
facilities and established or projected nearby uses.
      2.   Determine that there are utility services adequate to serve the
proposed use and to continue the utility systems to neighboring property lines
in order to facilitate continuity of utilities.
      3.   Assure that the design, grading and drainage, parking, circulation
design, landscaping, and other elements of the plan meet adopted performance
standards and function compatibly with nearby uses and public facilities.
      4.   To evaluate the location of streetlights and other site lighting
practices to protect public safety on-site and on adjoining rights-of-way,
without diminishing the livability of neighboring lands.
      5.   To consider if mitigation of any on-site or off-site impact is
necessary or would result in a more functional project that would not diminish
the potential use of public facilities or nearby private lands.
      6.   To identify the improvements and dedications required (curb,
sidewalk, paving, water, sewer, drainage, easements, right-of-way dedication,
etc.) to allow the project to meet legal requirements and to be compatible with
present or future development of neighboring land.
   E.   If material changes to the site development plans are required, the
plans will be returned to the applicant/representative for revision. Upon
submittal of a properly revised site plan, the Administrator may issue a
written approval addressing any supplementary conditions applicable to the
site. The owner shall acknowledge the review comments and conditions of
approval by counter-signing the written approval, returning an acknowledged
copy to the Administrator as a condition of permit issuance. When requirements
have been satisfied and the conditions of approval are acknowledged and
returned, the site plan may be approved. No construction or building permit
shall issue until provisional or final site plan approval has been issued by
the Administrator.
   F.   The applicant may appeal the decision of the Administrator to the
Planning and Zoning Commission by filing a notice of appeal in accordance with
appeal procedures set forth in this title.
   G.   The approval of a site plan shall be effective for a period of one year
from the date of approval. If actual physical development has not commenced or
an extension granted within the one-year period, the site plan approval shall
expire, and the applicant shall be required to resubmit for site plan review.
Prior to the expiration date of the effective period, the applicant may request
an extension, in writing, from the Administrator. The Administrator may grant
an extension, not to exceed one year upon a showing of good cause. The
Administrator shall address the request for extension by a written response to
the applicant. The applicant may appeal the Administrator's decision to deny an
extension in accordance with appeal procedures set forth in this title.
   H.   After site plan approval, the applicant may request an amendment, in
writing, to the approved site plan or to conditions of approval. If the
proposed amendment is a minor change to the plan and consistent with conditions
of approval, the Administrator may grant the amendment in writing upon receipt
of the request. If the Administrator determines the amendment involves
significant change to the conditions of approval, the Administrator shall
schedule a review with other staff members and the applicant shall pay an
additional one-half (1/2) of the then-current site plan review fee for review
of the proposed material amendment. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-6: ADMINISTRATIVE PERMITS:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide processes to allow certain land use
related permits to be approved administratively. The Administrator is hereby
granted discretion to decide the administrative permits addressed by this
chapter; home occupation permits, short term rentals, fence permits, accessory
dwelling unit permits, and other such permits as determined by the Kellogg City
Council. Application forms for all administrative permits shall contain
information required by this title and additional information relevant to the
specific permits requested. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-9-7: HOME OCCUPATION PERMITS:
Certain limited business or professional uses may be conducted as a home
occupation within a residential dwelling as a permitted land use subject to
specific limitations established to maintain compatibility with the surrounding

   H.   Landscape Standards: The purpose of these provisions is to provide
standards for landscaping, buffering, and screening, shading of parking areas,
and providing street trees.
      1.   Authority: The City shall have the authority to require fences,
walls, screening, or landscaping to buffer adverse external effects from or to
adjacent property or to otherwise protect the public health and safety.
      2.   Deviation From Landscape Standards: The City recognizes that because
of the wide variety of development and the relationships between them, it is
reasonable to permit flexibility in the application of landscape requirements.
Therefore, the Administrator may permit deviation from landscape requirements
depending on the characteristics of the neighborhood and/or existing site
conditions. Whenever the Administrator permits or requires a deviation from
these requirements, it shall be in writing stating the reasons for permitting
or requiring the deviation. Decisions by the Administrator may be appealed
according to procedures found in section
11-7-7, "Appeals", of this title.
      3.   Fencing: Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to set
aside or reduce any requirements for fencing as established by Federal, State,
County, or City laws for security, or other purposes.
      4.   Landscaping: All required yards abutting a street shall be
landscaped, except for those areas occupied by parking.
         a.   Landscaping shall include the planting, irrigation, and
maintenance of some combination of trees, ground cover, shrubs, vines, flowers,
or lawns. In addition, the combination or design may include natural features
such as rock and structural features including, but not limited to, fountains,
reflecting pools, artwork, screens, walls, and fences.
         b.   When undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots are
sold, the subdivider shall not be required to install the required landscaping.
Landscaping and screening shall be required when individual lots are developed.
         c.   For subdivisions providing common areas, planned unit
developments, or combination of subdivision and PUD, landscaping and
installation of such landscaping will be determined during the approval process
and detailed in the development agreement.
      5.   Commercial And Industrial Screening: Land used for open off street
parking, loading and/or storage, automotive sales, or other commercial and
industrial activities conducted outside an enclosed structure shall provide
fencing, a berm, landscaping or a combination thereof adjacent to public
rights-of-way to reduce the visual impact to the public.
      6.   Timing Of Landscaping: All required landscaping shall be completed
prior to use or occupancy of new buildings or structures weather conditions
permitting. An extension of time to complete landscaping may be granted by the
Administrator due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances. An extension of
time shall be in writing and state the reasons for the extension, a date for
completion, and signed by both the Administrator and the developer. The
developer shall provide surety (125 percent of the cost estimate for the
landscaping) in the form of cash, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit prior
to receiving an extension.
      7.   Maintenance: All required landscaping shall be maintained in good
growing condition and, whenever necessary, shall be replaced with new plant
materials to ensure continued compliance with applicable landscaping, shading,
and screening requirements.
      8.   Retention Of Trees: Every development shall retain healthy existing
trees eighteen inches (18") in diameter or more to the greatest extent possible
unless the retention of such trees would be an unreasonable burden to the
development. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)

Any procedure addressed by this title that authorizes the Planning and Zoning
Commission to make a decision, as contrasted with a recommendation to the City
Council, shall not be deemed a final decision unless it has been appealed to
the City Council by the party seeking to bring a judicial appeal. Any such
appeal must be filed with the Administrator within fourteen (14) days after the
date of the decision entered by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Any such
appeal must be accompanied by the filing fee established by resolution of the
City Council and a completed appeal application as provided by the
Administrator. Any such appeal shall be decided by the City Council within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the date it is filed with the Administrator.
Failure to file such an appeal shall constitute a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies prior to seeking reconsideration and court review of
proceedings. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-11-3: ADMINISTRATIVE EXCEPTIONS:
An administrative exception to express bulk or placement standards may be
approved by the Administrator upon a showing by an applicant that any such
exception is consistent with the intent of zoning ordinance policy in general,
that the exception is essential to make productive use of the land involved,
that the exception would not conflict with requirements established by uniform
codes, that the public safety would not be compromised and that the interests
of neighboring landowners would not be impaired by approval of the exception.
   A.   The maximum extent of administrative exception shall not exceed twenty
percent (20%) reduction in required setback from external property lines, up to
a ten percent (10%) reduction in lot area requirements or up to a ten percent
(10%) increase in the allowable height of buildings, administrative discretion
to allow fences or walls in excess of existing maximums by up to an additional
foot in the designated front yard area, and allowing fences or walls up to two
feet (2') higher than the maximum in a rear or side yard.
   B.   An application for an administrative exception shall include a written
description of the requested exception and a site plan that shows information
relevant to the request in order to allow the Administrator to evaluate the
proposed exception. Any application requesting an exception equal to fifty
percent (50%) or more of the maximum allowed by this section (e.g., a setback
reduction equal to 10 percent of the required setback or exceeding the maximum
height allowed by 5 percent, or more) shall include the names and addresses of
adjoining property owners. The Administrator will prepare a notice of any
administrative exception request and mail it to abutting property owners who
will have seven (7) calendar days from the date of mailing to deliver a written
responsive comment to the Administrator.
   C.   After considering the merits of any comments submitted by neighboring
landowners, an administrative exception may be approved, approved with
modifications or denied by the Administrator. The Administrator, when deciding,
shall consider the factors set forth in subsection A of this section.
   D.   Written notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant and
mailed to any abutting property owner who submitted written comments. A
decision may be appealed within seven (7) days of such mailing by any affected
property owner who commented or by the applicant in accordance with procedures
specified by this title for decisions made by the Administrator. (Ord. 595, 6-
13-2018)
11-11-4: LEGAL NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A legal nonconforming structure is one that was in compliance with all land use
and Building Code requirements at the time it was constructed, or that was
constructed or established before land use regulations were enacted, but does
not conform to the structure requirements of the current Land Use Codes of the
City. It is the policy of the City to encourage maintenance and continued
vitality of existing legal nonconforming structures until a change of land use
is undertaken by the owner in conformance with requirements of this title.
   A.   Any legal nonconforming permanent structure may continue to be used and
maintained as otherwise allowed by this title. A nonconforming structure shall
not be enlarged in area in any way that increases its non-conformity. A
structure used to house a non-conforming non-residential use may be enlarged by
up to ten percent (10%) of its square footage so long as any such enlargement
does not increase the non-conformity of any setbacks or building bulk
regulations.
   B.   A damaged or destroyed legal nonconforming structure may be repaired or
reconstructed provided that the extent of the previously existing
nonconformance is not increased.
   C.   Any structure legally built prior to the adoption of land use
regulations within a currently-required yard setback area shall be deemed a
legal non-conforming structure and the nonconforming dimension shall not be
expanded by additional construction, unless otherwise qualifying for a
variance. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-11-5: LEGAL NONCONFORMING USES:
All existing uses of land that are not permitted uses in the zoning district in
which such use is being conducted, and all uses which, if presently initiated,
would require a conditional use permit, and which do not have a conditional use
permit, are deemed legal nonconforming uses. Legal nonconforming uses shall not
be expanded or extended in any way, except as otherwise expressly allowed by
this title. A legal nonconforming use shall not be changed except to a use that
complies with the regulations of the zoning district in which the subject
property lies or to diminish its non- conformity. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-11-6: LEGAL NONCONFORMING LOTS:
All existing platted subdivision lots that do not meet the minimum lot area and
dimension standards of the district within which they are located are hereby
deemed nonconforming lots. Any lot that was legally created prior to the
effective date of this title may be used in conformance with the uses permitted
by the zoning district within which it is located, provided that all yard and
setback requirements are met.
   A.   If lot area is deficient in a residential zone by no more than fifty
percent (50%), any such non-conforming lot may be used only for construction of
a detached single-family residence.
   B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such lot is contiguous to one or
more lots of common ownership and any combination of such lots will meet the
area or dimension standards of this title, such lots shall be considered to be
an undivided parcel for the purposes of this title. Accordingly, the separate
lots shall be treated as a single parcel concerning the issuance of a building
permit for any residential construction on the lot, or contiguous commonly
owned lots where this condition exists. No nonconforming or conforming lot
shall be reduced in area or dimensions if such reduction would result in a
greater degree of nonconformity. In the least dense residential district in
jurisdiction, any lot with an area less than the minimum required for the least
dense residential district may only be developed to the minimum residential use
allowed in the zone. Any lot in any residential district that has an area less
than the minimum square footage desired, but at least fifty percent (50%) of
the minimum area, unless it adjoins one or more substandard lots held in common
ownership, may only be developed with a single-family dwelling unit.
   C.   The Administrator is authorized to take such steps as are necessary,
including civil or criminal litigation, to abate, penalize or prevent the use
of any unlawful structure, lot or use. (Ord. 595, 6-13-2018)
11-11-7: INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS PROGRAM:
The Institutional Controls Program is designed to protect the public residing
and working within the Bunker Hill Superfund Site. The Institutional Controls
Program (ICP) is administered by Idaho Panhandle Health District in accordance
with Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 41.01.01, 500 through 543.
   A.   Objective: The objective of the ICP is to insure that barriers are
created and maintained, and a system of activity controls and standards are
implemented to keep contaminants from migrating through any barrier or
remediate areas.
   B.   Permitting: All excavation, grading, and certain interior remodeling
projects for any land or structure within the superfund site must have an
approved permit from the Panhandle Health District (PHD). The PHD permit shall
be issued prior to any construction activity on permits issued by the City of
Kellogg begins. PHD shall inspect, and approve if warranted, work completed
before any certificate of occupancy or completion is issued by the City. (Ord.
595, 6-13-2018)
11-11-8: AREA OF CITY IMPACT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of establishing the Kellogg area of City impact is

STORM WATER STANDARDS 1
 
Notes
     All figures and tables are attached to ordinance 364, appendices B and C, on
1 file in the office of the city clerk. activities, and residential yard and
  community soils. To augment and protect this remediation, a comprehensive
  program called the institutional controls plan (ICP) has been developed by PHD.
ARTICLE A. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
SECTION:
11-13A-1: General
11-13A-2: Performance Standards
11-13A-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this document is to direct land development in
such a way as to minimize the negative effects or impacts that increased storm
water runoff can have on ground water, surface water, and public and private
property. It is the specific intention of the planning administrator to require
natural, on site control of storm water and to prohibit the release of
untreated storm water, sediments, and other materials from development sites.
   B.   Best Management Practices: This natural control can be afforded by a
series of techniques collectively called best management practices (BMPs).
These BMPs and their applications are described and referred to throughout
ordinance 364, on file in the office of the city clerk. In some situations BMPs
may not allow certain specific development goals. For these situations more
structural storm water controls may be used and some are discussed herein. In
either case, however, the collection and treatment efficiencies of the BMPs
shall stand as the measure against which the alternative measures must perform.
The control of storm water runoff and its effects as a result of BMPs or
equivalent technologies is considered to be the essence of storm water
management.
   C.   Institutional Controls Plan: Most of the terrain in the city of Kellogg
and its area of city impact are either mountainous or in the floodplain. This
area has a long history of mining and smelting activities which have left a
variety of wastes, including high concentrations of lead, arsenic, antimony,
copper, cadmium, mercury, and zinc. A twenty one (21) square mile area of the
Silver Valley, which includes the city of Kellogg, was declared a superfund
site by the EPA and has undergone extensive remediation of hillsides, areas of
mining
   The size and complexity of the site have resulted in the extensive use of
capping and contaminants stabilization techniques. The ICP was developed to
ensure that these contaminants remain controlled and away from direct human
contact to the greatest extent possible. "Institutional controls" are defined
as nonengineering mechanisms used to prevent or limit access to contaminated
soils, thereby eliminating health risks. The ICP at the Bunker Hill superfund
site (hereinafter referred to as the site) includes a barrier management
program (barriers are the physical means of limiting human contact with
contaminated soils; barriers can be as simple as a layer of clean soil, asphalt
paving, or a concrete sidewalk, but may also include access controls such as
fencing) to control large excavations and building renovations, an education
program to promote barrier awareness, a testing and monitoring program, and a
disposal program for contaminated materials which have been removed. PHD is the
manager of the ICP. The program maintains a property tracking system to assist
lending institutions as they continue to complete property transactions valley
wide, in addition to the education and enforcement of the ICP.
   D.   Areas Of Concern: The areas of greatest concern within the site with
regard to contaminants are the low lying areas, especially the floodplain
areas. The sediments which have been washed from the hillsides over the last
one hundred (100) years have collected in these areas and are associated with
high concentrations of contaminants to depths up to ten feet (10') in areas,
creating a considerable remediation challenge. Although the hillsides have
contaminated soils, they are usually of a superficial nature and may be
remediated by using methods as simple as deep tilling, which mixes the surface
soils with the clean underlying material and lowers the contaminant
concentrations to acceptable levels. Soil pH is also a concern in many areas.
Soils with pH as low as four (4) or five (5) are common within the site with
some as low as two (2). There is the existing hazard of mine dumps and tailings
located on the hillsides and these should be avoided when possible. For the
most part, the need for barriers is limited to the floodplains, mine waste
areas, and populated areas within three (3) miles of the smelter site.
   E.   Intent Of Regulations: It is the intent of these regulations to limit
migration of these contaminants, as well as direct human contact with them, to
the extent possible by controlling storm water.
   F.   Acknowledgments: The storm water control measures discussed in this
manual are supplemented versions of the "Best Management Practices For Storm
Water Management And Erosion And Sedimentation Control" and the "Storm Water
Management Plan Criteria And Engineering Standards", prepared for the
interagency storm water committee of Kootenai County by Kennedy Engineers of
Spokane, WA. They have been edited to reflect the environmental conditions and
concerns present in the site. Although they contain provisions for storm water
control in areas of heavy metal contamination and low pH, they are still useful
for, and it is recommended that they be practiced in, areas within Shoshone
County which includes the city of Kellogg which do not suffer the environmental
problems of the site.
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637, 4-9-2025)
11-13A-2: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   The following performance standards shall be applicable to the design,
construction, and maintenance of all storm water management systems developed
pursuant to the storm water management ordinance:
   A.   It is the specific intention of the planning administrator that there
shall be as little increase in the peak rate (flow) of surface runoff from a
site as possible when compared with the rate which is determined to have
existed from the natural, undeveloped state of that site. Designs and
contingencies shall accommodate runoff events up to and including that peak
flow from a 25-year storm event (see article G of this chapter).
   B.   All sediment resulting from site development activities shall be
detained on site during runoff events to the extent possible. Detained sediment
shall be either stabilized on site or removed in an approved manner.
Contaminated sediments shall be handled and disposed of in a manner and place
approved by the PHD and the Idaho department of health and welfare (IDHW-DEQ).
   C.   No storm water shall be collected or concentrated except in on site
channels which are projected from erosion (through the establishment of ground
cover [vegetation or other], installation of energy dissipating structures and/
or design of sufficiently low velocity producing slopes) (see article D of this
chapter). The potential effects of on site collected and concentrated storm
water, especially that from greater than design storm events, to off site areas
shall be considered during project design.
   D.   All storm water from the completed development shall be directed to
grassed infiltration areas (GIAs), where possible and appropriate, for
treatment by natural biological, chemical and physical processes which occur
during infiltration (percolation) into the ground. Grassed infiltration areas
(or their acceptable alternatives) shall be sized to store and treat the first
one-half inch (1/2") of runoff draining from the "impervious surface area from
a storm (precipitation or snowmelt) event (see article F of this chapter).
Further, the GIA shall be designed such that excess runoff volumes overflow to
a drywell or other approved on site system without damage to that storm water
system or adjacent land improvements. If the use of a GIA is impractical due to
slope or soil type, a written explanation of why must accompany the storm water
plan when it is submitted to the planning administrator. Any storm water from
the site which is not directed to a GIA must be detained on site long enough to
assure removal of all sediments in a sediment trap. No runoff released from the
sight shall have passed over contaminated soils which have been exposed by
activities on the sight without first having been detained in a sediment trap
for a sufficient time to have removed any sediments.
   E.   A storm water management plan shall be submitted for review and
approval prior to any site clearing or construction documenting the design
considerations of all storm water controls which are needed to meet the
requirements of the storm water management ordinance. In addition, a post
construction (as built) drawing(s) shall be submitted showing details of
completed control features, including the installation or repair of any
barriers, to PHD for inclusion in the tracking system (see article C of this
chapter).
   F.   An operation and maintenance plan shall be submitted for review and
approval, prior to any site clearing or construction, documenting the methods
and responsibility for the continued functioning and integrity of constructed
storm water controls and barriers (see article E of this chapter).
   G.   It is the intention of the planning administrator that all development
activities within his jurisdiction shall be conducted so as to achieve these
performance standards. It is acknowledged, however, that the cost of
preparation of a detailed storm water management plan for a single-family
residential dwelling may pose a financial hardship to the owner. As a result,
simplified storm water control planning procedures may be developed for smaller
projects; however, the intent and spirit of these regulations shall still be
met.
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637, 4-9-2025)
ARTICLE B. DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
11-13B-1: Storm Water Management Definitions
11-13B-1: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DEFINITIONS:
Storm water management definitions shall be as follow:
AGGREGATE: A term for the stone or rock gravel needed to fill in an
infiltration BMP, such as a trench.
ANTISEEP COLLAR: A device constructed around a pipe or other conduit and placed
through a dam, levee, or dike for the purpose of reducing seepage losses and
piping failures.
AQUIFER: A geologic stratum containing ground water that can be withdrawn and
used for human purposes.
AS BUILT DRAWINGS: Design plans which have been revised to reflect all changes
to the plans which occurred during construction.
BERM: A constructed IC barrier of compacted earth, rock, or gravel.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP): Physical, structural, and/or managerial
practices that, when used singly or in combination, prevent or reduce pollution
of water.
BIOFILTER: A designed, vegetated treatment facility where the more or less
simultaneous processes of filtration, infiltration, absorption, and biological
uptake of pollutants in storm water takes place when runoff flows over and
through. Vegetation growing in these facilities acts as both a physical filter
which causes gravity settling of particulates by regulating velocity of flow,
and also as a biological sink when direct uptake of dissolved pollutants
occurs.
BIOFILTRATION: The process of reducing pollutant concentrations in water by
filtering the polluted water through biological materials.
BOND: A surety bond, cash deposit or escrow account, assignment of savings,
irrevocable letter of credit, or other means acceptable to or required by the
permit authority to guarantee that work is completed in compliance with the
project's drainage plan and in compliance with all local government

BUFFER: The zone contiguous with a sensitive area that is required for the
continued maintenance, function, and structural stability of the sensitive
area. The critical functions of a riparian buffer (those associated with an
aquatic system) include shading, input or organic debris and coarse sediments,
uptake of nutrients, stabilization of banks, interception of fine sediments,
overflow during high water events, protection from disturbance by humans and
domestic animals, maintenance of wildlife habitat, and room for variation of
aquatic system boundaries.

distribution in a channel using vegetation, jetties, drops, revetments, and/or
other measures.
CHECK DAM: Small dam constructed in a gully or other small watercourse to
decrease the stream flow velocity, minimize channel scour, and promote
deposition of sediment.

rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The humanmade elements of the conveyance system
include gutters, ditches, pipes, channels, and most retention/detention
facilities.
CULVERT: Pipe or concrete box structure which drains open channels, swales, or
ditches under a roadway or embankment. Typically with no catch basins or
manholes along its length.
DESIGN STORM: A rainfall event of specific return frequency and duration that
is used to calculate the runoff volume and peak discharge rate.
DETENTION: The temporary storage of storm runoff in a BMP, which is used to
control the peak discharge rates, and which provides gravity settling of

title to reserve specified privileges for the users and beneficiaries of the
drainage facilities contained within the boundaries of the easement.
DROP SPILLWAY: Overall structure in which the water drops over a vertical wall
onto an apron at a lower elevation.

maintained through a set of institutional controls.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: A hard surface area which either prevents or retards the
entry of water into the soil mantle as under natural conditions prior to
development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow
present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious
surfaces include, but are not limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios,
driveways, parking lots, or storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, gravel
roads, packed earthen materials, and oiled, macadam or other surfaces which
similarly impeded the natural infiltration of storm water. Open, uncovered
retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces.
INFILTRATION: The downward movement of water from the surface to the subsoil.
The infiltration capacity is expressed in terms of inches/hour.

watercourse.
STORM FREQUENCY: The time interval between major storms of predetermined
intensity and volumes of runoff for which storm sewers and other structures are
designed and constructed to handle hydraulically without surcharging and
backflooding, e.g., a 2-year, 25-year, or 100-year storm.
STORM WATER: That portion of precipitation that does not naturally percolate
into the ground or evaporate, but flows via overland flow, interflow, channels
or pipes into a defined surface water channel, or a constructed infiltration
facility.
SWALE: A shallow drainage conveyance or infiltration area with relatively
gentle side slopes, generally with flow depths less than one foot (1').
TIME OF CONCENTRATION: The time period necessary for surface runoff to reach
the outlet of a subbasin from the hydraulically most remote point in the
tributary drainage area.
TREATMENT BMP: A BMP that is intended to remove pollutants from storm water. A
few examples of treatment BMPs are detention ponds, oil/water separators,
biofiltration swales, and constructed wetlands.

test results for metal contamination may be required by PHD for development or
improvement plans submitted for locations within the boundaries of the site.
Test results for many locations within the site are on file with the PHD and
may be used for submittal purposes if no substantial changes have occurred on
the location since the test was performed. A new set of tests must be conducted
in compliance with the sampling analysis protocol (SAP) on file with PHD.
   The plan submitted shall present (in an organized manner with references to
the plan drawings where appropriate) all pertinent calculations performed for
the determination of the required size of the storm water controls system
elements. Included in this category is an analysis of off site flow upstream of
the site, a determination of pre and post development runoff from the site
(both total volume and peak flow) with the associated volumes of expected
sediment generation; grassed infiltration area and detention/retention facility
capacities and infiltration rates; swale, ditch, culvert and pipe system
capacities and velocities; and any other appropriate design detail.
   B.   Vicinity Drainage Plan: A vicinity map, with a scale of 1:24,000 (2,000
feet to the inch) or larger, shall be prepared showing the relationship of the
development site to its surroundings. Storm water drainage patterns (excepted
or observed) shall be shown for all lands, surface waters, and environmentally
sensitive areas within one mile of the site. This map should also include
delineations showing areas of heavy metal contamination within the drainage
pattern of the area to be developed.
   C.   Site Plan: A site plan shall be a scale drawing(s) of not more than one
hundred feet (100') to the inch and shall show property (site) boundaries and
existing natural and manmade features on and within five hundred feet (500') of
the site boundary including roads, structures including collection channels and
pipes, erosion checks, water sources and drainage channels, utilities,
easements, topography (at 2 foot intervals, referenced to datum) soil types,
and vegetative cover types.
      In addition, the plan shall show areas to be cleared of vegetation; where
topsoil is to be removed and stockpiled; where excavation, filling and grading
is planned (with final contours); where structures, paving, utilities,
barriers, lawns, and landscaping are planned; anticipated post construction
runoff patterns, and storm water control features. The storm water control
features shall further show (either on the plan or attached) profile/cross
sections, bottom elevations, temporary and permanent IC barrier locations and
cross sections, slopes and lengths of swales and open ditches; sizes, type,
invert areas, detention (retention facilities and other storm water controls
with references to appropriate capacity calculations); and bottom elevations
and dimensions of any off site drainage channels into which overflow on site
storm water controls will pass. The plan shall also show storm water easements
as described in article E of this chapter.
   D.   Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan: An erosion and sedimentation
control plan shall be submitted and be approved prior to the initiation of any
site clearing, excavation, grading, or other development activity. The theory
and application of erosion and sedimentation control, as well as required
elements are discussed in article D of this chapter.
   E.   Barrier Option Plan (BOP): A barrier option plan detailing the
condition of the soils on the site, including test results from a qualified lab
or agency showing the types and concentrations of heavy metals present and the
pH may be required by PHD. The types and locations of existing IC barriers,
areas most likely to become contaminated if soil migration occurs and the uses
of those areas, temporary IC barriers to be used during the construction phase
including a maintenance plan, and permanent IC barrier designs may also be
required for review. Details and cross sections will be required for all soil
cap barriers and shall conform to the minimum standards shown in the barrier
performance standards. Details of any temporary or permanent access control for
vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be included in the BOP. This will
include a plot plan showing access and egress locations, staging sites,
decontamination locations, fencing, and public detours. More information
concerning the requirements of this plan are specified in article D of this
chapter.
   F.   Contaminated Soil Disposal Plan: A plan and schedule for removing,
handling, transporting, and disposing of any contaminated soils is required for
sites which have lead levels in excess of the action levels listed in the
environmental rule and the institutional controls program; barrier design
criteria and permitting requirements (ICP;BDC&PR). Soils with lead levels
exceeding one thousand (1,000) ppm must either be off-hauled to the PHD
approved soil repository or used as fill material under a barrier. An equipment
decontamination plan to ensure that no contaminants are tracked off of the job
site by equipment or vehicles and a source for any imported borrow material
(including soil tests) may also be required. More information concerning the
requirements of this plan are specified in article D of this chapter.
   G.   Operation And Maintenance Plan: An operation and maintenance plan shall
be required for all developments describing the planned efforts which will be
followed to ensure future functioning of constructed storm water controls and
institutional controls as they relate to storm water management. This also will
be reviewed and approved separate from the storm water management plan.
Maintenance efforts should include annual inspections, replacement of damaged
vegetation in grassed infiltration areas, replacement of eroded soils in
channels, repair of any damaged IC barriers, schedule of sediment removal from
control structures with associated disposal protocol, and remediation of any
contaminated soils which may have resulted from a damaged IC barrier. Other
efforts and specific requirements of operation and maintenance plans are given
in article E of this chapter.
   H.   Dust Control Plan: If the proposed project involves the use of heavy
equipment for the purpose of earthwork, a dust control plan may be required by
PHD. The plan must detail a realistic work schedule for all activities which
will create airborne dust and the means by which the contractor or on site
agent plans to control it. More information concerning the requirements of this
plan are specified in article D of this chapter.

11-13C-3: PLAN REVIEW:
   A.   Two (2) sets of prints of the plan drawings and two (2) sets each of
the project summary and design calculations, erosion and sedimentation control
plan, IC barrier protection and soil handling plan and operation and
maintenance plan, each signed and stamped by the design professional, shall be
submitted to the planning administrator for review and approval. Acceptance of
the submitted materials shall be based on the determination that the proposed
development is in compliance with the storm water ordinance. One marked up set
of prints and plans plus written comments/questions will be returned to the
applicant.
   B.   Engineered submittals will be reviewed by a qualified professional
engineer. If any of the parts of the plan are returned for corrections or
additional information, changes must be marked or highlighted in color on
revised copies and returned. The colors red and yellow are reserved the
planning administrator's use. The date that changes are made must be clearly
indicated.
   C.   To help expedite the review of a development plan, the sponsor and/or
his designer may request a meeting with the planning administrator following
receipt of initial review comments. However, prior to such a meeting, the
sponsor and his designer shall review all initial comments and be prepared to
discuss alternate solutions.
   D.   A copy of the approved plan must be on site whenever construction is in
progress. During any aspect of site development, if field conditions prove to
be substantially different from conditions assumed by the design professional,
such that storm water controls may not function as planned, the approved plan
will be deemed invalid. Revised portions of the plan shall be submitted for
review and approval, prior to resuming construction work. Any deviation from
the approved plan shall be approved in writing by the planning administrator
prior to further work.

   Prior to acceptance of plat improvements, release of bond, issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, or final sign off by the planning administrator, a
postconstruction drawing(s) shall be submitted by the applicant's design
professional to the planning administrator. All substantive differences from
the original, approved, design drawing(s) shall be approved and a reproducible
copy of the accepted drawings shall be labeled "POSTCONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS". The
following statement shall be lettered on these drawing(s) and stamped and
signed by the design professional certifying the postconstruction drawing(s):
I have reviewed the construction and find it to be in substantial conformance
with the approved plans.

11-13D-4: Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan Requirements
11-13D-5: BOP Requirements
11-13D-6: Contaminated Soil Disposal Plan
11-13D-7: References
11-13D-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DEFINITION:
   A.   A storm water drainage control system shall be provided before, during,
and after all pertinent land disturbance or construction. The goal of this
system is to minimize, to the maximum extent possible, the effect that
sediments and storm water runoff (including snow melt) can have on ground water
and surface water quality or on public or private downstream property,
especially with respect to heavy metal contaminant migration.
   B.   An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required to be
submitted to, and approved by, the planning administrator prior to the
initiation of any site clearing, excavation, construction, or other development
activity. This plan will address both temporary (primarily construction
related) and permanent erosion controls. Specific erosion/sedimentation
controls shall be consistent with those described in the Panhandle Area
Councils' "Handbook Of Best Management Practices For Storm Water Management And
Erosion Sedimentation Control Revised For The Environmental Conditions Of The
Bunker Hill Superfund Site". An approved erosion and sedimentation control plan
shall represent the minimum requirements for anticipated site conditions.
Additional erosion and/or sedimentation controls may be required in the event
of unexpected storm occurrences, repair, or maintenance of existing systems,
temporary or permanent barrier protection, or replacement of nonfunctioning
systems.
   C.   For the purpose of this section, "erosion" is considered to mean the
detachment and movement of soil or rock as a result of the action of water,
wind, ice, gravity, or human activities. "Sedimentation" shall mean the
deposition or accumulation of sediment (soil, dust, debris, or other materials)
on ground surfaces and in watercourses.
   D.   Note the suggestions and recommendations made herein are not intended
to limit, in any way, the use of the best available technology on achieving
erosion and sedimentation control. However, for other runoff control techniques
which are proposed for use in the erosion and sedimentation control plan, it
may be required to show that equivalent control or treatment can be achieved
utilizing alternatives not described.
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. Ord. 637, 4-9-2025)
11-13D-2: TEMPORARY EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROLS:
   A.   Prior to any clearing or grading for any land disturbance or
development which falls under the authority of the city of Kellogg storm water
management ordinance, devices or structures which shall intercept and collect
all runoff from (or flowing across) the proposed disturbed areas shall be
installed or constructed. This interception and collection shall make use of
best available runoff management practices, and shall preclude the direct,
uncontrolled discharge of sediment laden runoff to downstream properties, and
provide for the collection of sediment particles on site prior to runoff
discharge off site.
   B.   It is recognized that sediment removal efficiencies of temporary runoff
collection devices will vary depending on soil type and other factors. Very
fine grained suspended sediment carried in runoff may not be stopped by the
required interception and collection. In addition to causing turbid conditions
in water bodies, this fine sediment can carry a significant level of heavy
metal contaminants, nutrients, and other pollutant which can harm water
quality, pollute neighboring soils, and even pose significant health risks.
While higher sediment removal efficiencies can be achieved by increasing the
size or complexity of the collection devices or structures, one hundred percent
(100%) sediment removal cannot realistically be expected from temporary
sedimentation controls. As a result, other measures aimed at reducing the
initial erosion shall be included in the erosion and sedimentation control
plan. The focus of these measures shall be all denuded and graded areas, soil
stockpiles, water bodies, or otherwise exposed contaminated soils.
   C.   Storm water runoff from active construction sites can be effectively
intercepted and collected using earthen berms, straw bales, silt fences, and
other techniques described in the handbook of best management practices. For
sites of less than five (5) acres, located more than one-quarter (1/4) mile
from a designated surface water or environmentally sensitive area, temporary
sediment traps are recommended and will likely be required (based on the
potential for erosion, sedimentation, and soil contamination problems in the
site area). While specific design details are presented in the handbook, some
general, but important, considerations are given below:
      1.   Any barrier, berm, or structure forming a sediment trap shall be
located to provide for maximum volume capacity for trapping sediment behind the
structure and for greatest ease of cleanout.
      2.   Sedimentation traps shall provide a minimum of one foot (1') below
the outfall (overflow) elevation of cleanout.
      3.   The sediment traps shall be located as close as possible to the
disturbed area.
      4.   Runoff from undisturbed areas should be excluded from the sediment
trap to the extent possible.
      5.   No contaminated soil shall be left exposed to a storm event of any
kind. Work shall be done in such a fashion that soil exposed during the day is,
at a minimum, covered with a synthetic membrane (6 mil poly tarp) at the end of
the day if precipitation is expected.
      6.   Each sediment trap shall be inspected after significant runoff
events to check for damage or operational problems. Sediment shall be removed
from traps when it fills half (1/2) of the constructed capacity and disposed of
in an appropriate fashion (at a PHD approved repository). All collected
sediments will be considered, until demonstrated otherwise, to be contaminated
and shall be disposed of at the Page site. Access to the Page site will be
allowed via PHD.
      7.   Sediment traps should be used where they will see two (2) years or
less of service. Once the contributing drainage area has been stabilized, the
sediment traps should be removed.
      8.   For sites of greater than five (5) acres, or where the distance to a
designated surface water is less than one-quarter (1/4) mile, or for permanent
runoff control, sedimentation basins or detention ponds may be required based
on local erosion/sedimentation and contaminant migration potential (see below).
      Many runoff controls described in the handbook are appropriated for use
in controlling the initial detachment of soils or rock that occurs in the
erosion process. One very basic technique which should be inherently obvious to
all site developers and storm water control engineers is the preservation of
existing vegetation. A stable plant cover, in a healthy condition, will
preclude erosion where it provides seventy five to one hundred percent
(75–100%) cover 1 . Preservation of natural and/or restorative vegetation shall
be considered during the planning and design stages of a development and areas
to be preserved shall be indicated on the erosion and sedimentation control
plan (see below). Further, designated preserve areas must be fenced to protect
them from damage by construction equipment.
   D.   Other runoff controls which are recommended for erosion control are
mulches, pervious covers (jute/cotton woven netting), impervious covers (the
most effective inexpensive means of protecting exposed contaminated soils from
precipitation), and filter fabric silt fences. Whichever of these, or other,
runoff and erosion controls are used, they should be maintained and left in
place until the construction site or other disturbed area is permanently
stabilized and all permanent barriers are in place.
   E.   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization of graded areas, denuded
areas, and soil stockpiles must be applied within two (2) weeks after initial
clearing 2 . If there is greater than a thirty percent (30%) chance of a
precipitation event of more than 0.25 inch expected within that two (2) week
period, interim measures such as plastic tarps and silt fences should be used.
Although this is a nonenforceable requirement by virtue of the precipitation
probability, it is incumbent upon the contractor or owner to make a reasonable
attempt to stay abreast of weather forecasts and make an appropriate effort to
ensure that the site is protected from any significant precipitation.
   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization shall be performed as soon as
possible after initial soil disturbance. Applicable practices include
vegetation establishment, mulching, and early application gravel base on areas
to be paved. Soil stabilization measures should be appropriate for the time of
year, site conditions, and estimated duration of use (for example winter
grading with hydroseeding will not be allowed).
   F.   A final requirement which is primarily related to construction
activities is the transportation or tracking of soils (mud) from work sites by
vehicles, particularly in areas where heavy metals are present in the soil.
Wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads,
provisions must be made (in the erosion and sedimentation control plan) for
control of this. While daily street sweeping can be effective in limiting this
movement of soils off site, temporary rock construction entrances are generally
more effective and less labor intensive (see handbook). In the case of job
sites with contaminated soils, all vehicular traffic which comes into contact
with the contamination must be made free of mud, dust, or other incidental dirt
before leaving the site in order to control migration of the contaminants to
clean or remediated areas. (A detailed description of decontamination
procedures is to be included in the BOP for PHD's review.) This process is
simplified if a rock pad is established on a portion of the job site and is
used as a staging area for employee parking, deliveries, personnel and
equipment decontamination, fueling and any other general site access. The pad
may be kept and incorporated later into the project as part of a road base or
building pad (e.g., covered by a permanent barrier) or it must be removed and
treated as contaminated material.

11-13D-3: PERMANENT EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROLS:
   A.   General: When erosion and sedimentation control plans are prepared they
must consider potential erosion for the development "in perpetuity".
Fortunately for developers, the risk of erosion and resultant sedimentation,
either on or off site, diminishes when the soils become stabilized. Soil
stabilization can be accomplished by establishing vegetation or covering with
pavement, structures or other permanent impervious barrier. The preferred
method of soil stabilization (where structures are not to be placed) is by
vegetation since this allows the soil to maintain its natural absorptive and
purifying characteristics. This stabilization should take place as soon as
possible following the initial disturbance.
      The following is a list of considerations that must be addressed, where
appropriate, for adequate long term control of erosion on a site:
      1.   Permanent Vegetation: Establish perennial, herbaceous vegetation
(grass) on disturbed area in the maximum extent possible. As shown in article F
of this chapter, grassed areas are extremely beneficial in absorbing moisture
in rainfall and snow melt and in filtering runoff as it percolates to the
ground water. Grasses and other types of vegetation can be applied effectively
as seed; with mulch, fertilizer and other additives recommended to protect and
enhance the initial growth. Care should be taken with all fertilizer
applications to prevent its wash off and transport to surface water bodies.
Grass can also be applied as sod, which is appropriate on steep slopes, and for
late season applications. It is important, however, to select the proper
vegetation for the intended uses of an area, particularly in areas where the pH
restricts growth for many species.
      2.   Vegetative Buffer Strips: In order to provide for short and long
term protection of existing, adjacent watercourses, water bodies or wetlands,
vegetated buffer (or filter) strips shall be created and/or protected and
maintained. Buffer strips shall consist of grass or other close growing
vegetation designed to receive overland flow. The width of the buffer shall be
sufficient to prevent erosion, trap sediment in overland flow, provide access
to water body and allow for periodic flooding without damage to structures.
Generally, good performance for pollutant removal can be expected if the buffer
is fifty (50) to seventy five feet (75') wide with an additional four feet (4')
for each one percent (1%) slope at the site 1 . Specific proposed widths will
be evaluated on a case by case basis.
      3.   Watercourses:
         a.   Natural watercourses (channels carrying natural drainage on an
intermittent or infrequent basis) should be avoided during clearing and site
development. However, if these areas do become impacted they must be restored
and revegetated using natural plant species to the extent possible. Temporary
erosion controls (jute netting for instance) will be required within one week
after completion of work and during the establishment of a permanent vegetative
cover. All soils disturbed during construction should be stabilized within
fourteen (14) days of initial disturbance. Any contaminated soils within the
naturally established stream environment, as defined by the handbook, which
have been exposed during development shall not be left subject to any storm
event in excess of 0.25 inch, to the extent that weather predictions can be
followed, and shall be covered by a temporary impervious synthetic membrane
(such as 6 mil poly tarp) if such an event is predicted. This practice is to be
continued until all permanent barriers and erosion control measures have been
constructed. Any contaminated soils which have been removed must be properly
disposed of at a PHD approved soil repository.
         b.   Artificial watercourses such as storm water conveyance channels,
grassed swales and gutters must be designed with short and long term erosion
controls in mind. Generally it is recommended that these "structures" be grass
lined as this provides for percolation and filtration of a portion of the
runoff flow. Grassy vegetation also tends to slow the flow and this dampens the
peak flows to downslope areas. Vegetative cover in channels and swales will
naturally tend to reduce runoff velocities but suitable grade must be designed
which is favorable to growth of the cover and which provides velocities not
greater than four (4) to six feet (6') per second 2 . Rigid lining of any
artificial watercourse such as gunite or concrete shall be constructed to
ensure that it is not damaged by frost heave. Specific designs will be
evaluated on a case by case basis by a professional engineer. The planning
administrator may elect to share any engineering review to limit the cost.
Review costs, however, will be borne by the applicant. Other design
considerations are detailed in the handbook.
      4.   Detention And Retention Basins:
         a.   The most common "low structural" best management practice for
storm water control is detention storage 1 . Storage in depressions or actual
detention basins reduces peak runoff flows and treats the runoff by
sedimentation and percolation. Detention refers to the temporary or partial
storage of storm flows, so detention basins would have an overflow outlet
structure to allow them to be drained either downslope or subsurface. When
released to surface drainages off site, detained water shall be released in a
manner approximating the predevelopment, natural flow of runoff. Retention on
the other hand is the complete or permanent storage of storm water. Retention
basins could be larger structures at the end of a runoff collection system or
network, or they could be smaller depressions providing "off line" storage. The
treatment mechanisms in retention systems are percolation and
evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration does not occur in the Silver Valley in
the winter months; therefore, the designer must account for this when
calculating storage volumes. Either detention or retention facilities will be
required in areas of soil contamination to ensure that any incidental sediment
picked up by storm water coming from the developed area is removed before the
water is released to downstream areas. If the soil in the drainage area has
been demonstrated to be clean either by testing or review of PHD data,
detention and/or retention facilities may or may not be required depending on
what the runoff and erosion calculations reveal. Runoff control is mandatory.
      b.   Both detention and retention facilities can be either wet or dry
areas. Dry catchment basins can be developed to serve as dual purpose areas,
providing dry weather recreational or aesthetic benefits along with wet weather
runoff storage. Wet ponds or manmade wetlands can provide some recreation and
aesthetic benefits and also a greater degree of pollutant removal. If the
detention or retention facility is to be used for recreation, it must be
demonstrated that the collected sediments have levels below the action level
(1,000 ppm). If sediment levels exceed the action level, then access control
(fencing) must be considered. The maintenance of healthy biological communities
in wet basins can be extremely difficult, however. The banks of detention and
retention basins shall be constructed with a gentle slope into the basin for
safety reasons and to encourage growth of vegetation in wet ponds. Other design
details, especially for embankments (berms) and overflow details shall be as
required in the handbook. Note that natural water bodies and wetlands shall not
be used for storm water runoff storage or treatment.
      5.   Maintenance: All temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation
control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure the
continued performance of their intended function. A long term maintenance
program must also be outlined in the erosion and sedimentation control plan and
the operation and maintenance plan (see article E of this chapter) which
includes responsibility for annual inspections, postrunoff event inspections,
access controls, repairs, and liability in the event of downslope damages or
contamination.
      Maintenance efforts may include (but are not limited to) removal and
disposal of sediment from detention or retention basins or ponds, replacement
or vegetation in grassed infiltration areas, buffer strips or watercourses,
repair (filling) of eroded rills or gullies and watering of established
vegetation. Removal of sediments from control structures requires that the
sediments be considered contaminated and disposed of at the Page site via PHD
access or demonstrate by testing that the sediments area free of contaminants
(below 350 ppm lead) and may be disposed of in some other location.

11-13D-4: EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
   The erosion and sedimentation control plan mirrors in several respects the
storm water management plan, the BOP, and contaminated soil disposal plan
described in article C of this chapter. While the focus is somewhat different,
there are several areas of overlap and duplication. In spite of this, it is the
intention of the planning administrator that the erosion and sedimentation
control plan be a separate document (a plan sheet with notes for example) which
will receive a separate review and approval. This plan will, however, make
reference to the overall site storm water management plan, the BOP, and the
contaminated soil disposal plan where appropriate.
   Each erosion and sedimentation control plan which meets the review
requirements of the planning administrator and all appropriate engineering
reviews may be required to contain complete information on the following
topics:
   A.   Existing site conditions (map at not more than one hundred feet (100')
to the inch).
   B.   Site boundaries.
   C.   Location of existing roads, structures, general vegetation types,
surface water bodies (streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands) and their
buffers, utilities and easements within five hundred feet (500') of the site
boundary.
   D.   Topography (2 foot intervals for 0–10 percent slope, 5 foot intervals
for 10–30 percent slope, and approximate intervals for slope greater than 30
percent).
   E.   Existing storm water runoff patterns with known or anticipated flow (in
cubic feet per second), volume (cubic feet) and velocity (feet per second)
information.
   F.   Soil type distribution and profiles (with tabulated USDA soil
conservation service "erodability" and "permeability" factors) and any soil
test results showing lead levels present. Soil tests shall be performed per the
soil analysis protocol (SAP) or performed by PHD and the cost borne by the
applicant.
   G.   Proposed site conditions.
   H.   Location of all buildings, structures, and paving (including graveled
walks and driveways). Location of all temporary changes to the land surface:
clearing limits, vegetation preserve areas, soil stockpile areas, temporary
erosion and sedimentation control features, and temporary IC barrier locations
and types (with notes indicating type of facility, construction materials,
dimensions, and holding capacity in gallons per cubic feet).
   I.   Location of all permanent changes to the land surface: cuts
(excavations) and fills (with cross sections), revegetation areas (with type,
size and extent), permanent erosion and sedimentation control areas (with notes
indicating type of facility, construction materials, dimensions and holding
capacity where appropriate), and barriers (types and locations).
   J.   Proposed storm water runoff patterns with anticipated flow, volume and
velocity information.
   K.   Schedule of construction and revegetation work.
   L.   Anticipated starting and completion dates of each phase of work.
   M.   Maintenance/repair schedule and responsibility.
   N.   Routine inspection schedules for during construction and afterward.
   O.   Anticipated maintenance efforts.
   P.   Who will be responsible (legally bound) for long term maintenance
repairs and liability after construction is complete.
   The erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be submitted and approved
by the planning administrator prior to the commencement of any work on site.
Failure to comply with this will be cause for enforcement actions as provided
by the storm water ordinance and the PHD.
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637, 4-9-2025)
11-13D-5: BOP REQUIREMENTS:
   The BOP has overlapping information with other plans required in the overall
storm water management plan but due to the levels of heavy metal contamination
found in the soils in the site and the health problems that they are capable of
creating, it is viewed as prudent, and therefore may be required by PHD, that
this issue be given a plan of its own. This plan will, however, make reference
to the overall site storm water management plan, the erosion and sedimentation
control plan, and the contaminated soil disposal plan where appropriate.
   If the soil on the site tests out below the action levels, one thousand
(1,000) ppm in individual residential yards and three hundred fifty (350) ppm
average over the entire area of a proposed development, no BOP is required for
submittal. There are two (2) areas of concern on a given site; the primary
development location and the adjacent hillside property. Both of these need to
be tested in accordance with the SAP on file with PHD.
   A.   The BOP shall include the following information:
      1.   Soil test results for the site itself showing lead levels at the
required soil depths. Soil sampling and testing methods shall be in accordance
with those laid out in the ICP and SAP and shall be performed by a qualified
lab or provided in the tracking information held by PHD. The developer may use
test results already on file with PHD if they reflect the present condition of
the site.
      2.   Soil profiles and types found on the site as listed by the soil
conservation service in their "Interim Soil Survey Of The Silver Valley Area,
Idaho" in conjunction with a more in depth study by a qualified soil scientist
of the on site if conditions warrant.
      3.   Locations, types, and present condition of all existing barriers on
the site shall be shown on a map of the site (scale not to exceed 100 feet to
the inch). Most or all of the existing conditions should be available through
the PHD tracking system.
      4.   The map shall show all natural drainage features within five hundred
feet (500') of the site including all environmentally sensitive areas
downstream of the site. The map shall also show topographic intervals as
specified in the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
      5.   Locations of all proposed barrier disturbances and/or the exposure
of any previously unexposed contaminated soils.
      6.   Detail drawings, locations, descriptions of, and schedules for
installation, maintenance, and removal of all temporary barriers to be used
during construction.
      7.   Detail drawings, locations, descriptions of all permanent barriers
to be installed. A long term maintenance and inspection plan shall also be
included.
      8.   Personal protective measures, including apparel, equipment,
sanitation, and safety zones to be taken by employees during all activities
involving exposed contaminated soils.
      9.   Any other requirements mandated by the PHD or IDHW-DEQ regarding
environmental safety.
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637, 4-9-2025)
11-13D-6: CONTAMINATED SOIL DISPOSAL PLAN:
   A.   Disposal of contaminated soils must be done in an approved manner and
location in order to minimize the migration of soil contaminants and maintain
the integrity of the barrier system. If the excavation involves less than one
cubic yard of residential soil, PHD will provide a container for the soil and
will collect it for disposal at the Page soil repository or other PHD approved
location. This service is free of charge. If the excavation exceeds one cubic
yard, it becomes the responsibility of the property owner to remove the soil
and transport it for disposal. There will be no charge for dumping. Access to
the repository site will be arranged through the PHD.
   B.   The following elements are required in a submittal if any soils are to
be excavated and removed. Some of these elements are required for other
portions of the storm water plan and may be referred to instead of resubmitted.
      1.   Calculations determining the amount of contaminated soil to be
removed.
      2.   A plan explaining the process to be used for soil removal,
transporting, and disposal, including equipment to be used.
      3.   An equipment decontamination plan showing design details. It is
recommended that this be done over a pad of crushed rock in an area which will
later be paved (for road or driveway) and maintained as a barrier zone. All
decontamination procedures must comply with those outlined in the ICP;BDC&PR.
      4.   A detailed dust control plan and schedule for the duration of the
project per the ICP;BDC&PR.

ARTICLE E. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE PLAN CRITERIA
SECTION:
11-13E-1: General Requirements
11-13E-2: Storm Water Easements
11-13E-3: Plan Criteria
11-13E-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   All storm water runoff controls and permanent erosion/sedimentation controls
which are approved by the planning administrator shall be maintained and
operated to function as if they were designed "in perpetuity". To ensure this,
an operation and maintenance plan shall be required to be submitted and
approved prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or acceptance of plat
improvements or final sign off by the planning administrator.
   It is acknowledged that development designers and contractors are not
responsible for long term functioning of constructed storm water controls.
Further, landowners and agency personnel change over time make record keeping
and management of critical importance to the achievement of this goal. For this
reason the operation and maintenance plan must be prepared by the project
design engineer and must be tied to each successive property owner through the
establishment of storm water easements which are recorded on the property title
(deed).
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637. 4-9-2025)
11-13E-2: STORM WATER EASEMENTS:
   All storm water control facilities (swales, grassed infiltration areas,
detention/retention ponds, underground piping, etc.) and natural drainage
channels shall be located in dedicated storm water easements. Both storm water
facilities and their respective easements shall be shown on the final
postconstruction drawings (see article C of this chapter). Easements shall be
located to provide access for routine inspection and shall be sized for access
of construction equipment that would be needed for maintenance and repair work
(i.e., generally 8 to 10 feet wide for vehicle access).
(Ord. 364, 4-5-1989; amd. Ord. 637. 4-9-2025)
11-13E-3: PLAN CRITERIA:
   Due to the wide range of storm water controls that could be built for
development projects within the jurisdiction of the planning administrator,
only general criteria can be stated within. This does not, however, relieve the
project designer from providing a specifically detailed plan which can be
followed to bring about the continual functioning of these controls. The
general criteria are listed and briefly described below.
   A.   Inspection Schedule: Constructed storm water controls (including
permanent erosion/sedimentation controls and barriers) shall be inspected at
least annually for a minimum of five (5) years. After five (5) years, a future
schedule will be determined based on the established history of the controls.
Inspections shall also be performed following precipitation and runoff events
which approach or exceed the "design storm" criteria used to size storm water
controls (see article G of this chapter).
   B.   Contact Person: A person shall be designated (and approved by the
planning administrator) who shall be responsible for operation and maintenance
of storm water controls. For example, this person could be the landowner for
small developments, a maintenance supervisor or groundskeeper for larger
developments, or a public works representative for storm water systems
maintained by the municipality. Provisions shall be made for the specific
responsible person to be designated on the property title (deed).
   C.   Maintenance Activities: Specific maintenance needs of grassed
infiltration areas are presented in article F of this chapter. Also, general
maintenance activities for permanent erosion and sedimentation controls are
given in article D of this chapter. Other maintenance activities which should
be included where appropriate are:
      1.   For grassed infiltration areas, watering, mowing, and fertilizing.
      2.   For grassed infiltration areas, sod renovation.
      3.   For detention basins, sediment and debris removal and appropriate
disposal.
      4.   For detention ponds (permanent wet basins), vegetation harvesting
and sediment removal and appropriate disposal (Page site if contaminated).
      5.   For oil/grit separators, cleaning and sludge disposal plan.
      6.   For storm drain inlets, debris removal.
      7.   For all storm water controls repair of any deterioration which
threatens their structural integrity. These repairs may include replacement of
rock in emergency spillways, reconstruction of dikes or berms, replacement of
catch basin or drywell lids, etc.
      8.   Warning signs ("Dump no waste, drains to groundwater") shall be
maintained on or adjacent to storm drain inlets. (Stencils are available for
loan from Panhandle health district and division of environmental quality.)
      9.   For all barriers, repair any deterioration which threatens their
integrity, or the migration of contaminated sediments.

11-13F-1: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   All land developed within the site shall incorporate storm water runoff
treatment facilities to mitigate the potential for ground and surface water
degradation. The preferred treatment mechanism is the infiltration of storm
water runoff through a grassed area. When development of the land is in the
planning stages, these types of controls can easily be included in the design
of green area landscaping. The planning administrator understands that much of
the terrain and soil types within the site do not lend themselves well to use
of GIAs; however, many of the lower areas within the site basin are
appropriate. The use of this technology wherever possible will limit the
further migration of heavy metal contaminants towards the local ground water
supply as well as the Coeur d'Alene River drainage system. Alternative systems
may be used subject to the approval of the planning administrator.

Total dissolved solids                    50%
Nutrients:             Nitrate        20% 50%

Bacteria                                  99%
 
   B.   The primary principle of storm water controls using natural vegetated
areas (i.e., grassed infiltration areas) is, when runoff passes over or is held
over grass covered permeable soils, the volume is reduced by percolation and
the quality of this percolate is improved by biological, chemical and physical
filtering. A design criterion which must be kept in mind is to provide enough
grassed infiltration area to handle the runoff generated at the site so as not
to overload the infiltration areas. An overload is defined as that volume or
rate of runoff which could damage the grassed infiltration or swale area and
reduce its effectiveness in future runoff events. Numerous possibilities exist
to aid the process of storm water disposal utilizing grassed infiltration
areas.
   C.   Grassed swales and gutters can be used instead of impervious
passageways to transport storm flows 2 . These grassy areas will not only
percolate and filter a portion of the flow, but also slow the flow and thus
dampen the peak flows to downslope areas. Certain types of grasses, termed
"high roughness", help to emphasize the flow delay 3 and may be found in the
soil conservation service's interim soil survey of the Silver Valley area.
Vegetative cover in swales and gutters will naturally tend to reduce runoff
velocities but a suitable slope must be designed which is favorable to the
growth of the cover and which provides velocities not greater than four feet
(4') per second 4 (evaluated on a case by case basis).

11-13F-2: SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRASSED INFILTRATION AREAS:
   A.   Standards:
      1.   Where the grassed infiltration concept is employed, infiltration of
the required runoff volumes (first 1/2 inch from impervious surfaces) shall be
assured by designing the system to retain the prescribed volume. This is
necessary to ensure that various biological, chemical, and physical processes
active within the root zone act on the required volume of runoff.
      2.   No GIA shall be designed to receive direct runoff from an area
contaminated with heavy metals or low pH unless that area has had barriers
installed or can otherwise be demonstrated not to be a contaminant migration
source. All contaminated areas shall have an appropriate barrier(s) to prevent
direct contact with storm water or all runoff from such areas shall be directed
through a detention/containment facility with a sediment trap or other approved
method of sediment detention.
      3.   The GIA needs to be situated on a good soil mantle which allows the
grass to grow and should not have to be fertilized. The subsoil underlying the
infiltration area should not be compacted during or subsequent to construction
or its ability to pass water could be severely compromised. High permeability
soils (silty sand to sandy soils are preferable) underlying the topsoil mantle
are recommended of the GIA is to pass water at a reasonable rate.
      4.   The surface area required for GIA installation is dependent on the
flooded depth. The design of the surface area of the grassed infiltration area
is to be determined using the volume of the runoff, received from the developed
areas (including, but not limited to, roofs and paved or gravel driveways,
parking areas, and walkways) as well as precipitation falling on the GIA
directly, which produces an average depth of six inches (6") within the GIA.
Flexibility in depth is desirable but there are certain limits which must be
observed. An average flooded depth on the order of four inches (4") is
desirable for three (3) reasons:
         a.   At this flooded depth, the time the grassed area is under water
allows the use of traditional turf grass rather than water tolerant varieties;
         b.   The amount of surface area involved should provide twenty to
thirty (20–30) years of effective contaminant removal in areas which are not
subject to concentrated contaminants. GIAs should be monitored on an annual
basis for build up of heavy metals and the soil in these GIAs should be
removed, disposed of, and replaced when the lead levels exceed the action level
of one thousand (1,000) ppm. Access control (fencing) should be considered if
heavy metal accumulation is expected;
         c.   Shallow grassed areas have a desirable aesthetic appearance.
      5.   Typically, best management practices dictate that the design of GIAs
be sufficient to catch and treat the first one-half inch (1/2") of a storm
event 1 . For storm events producing volumes of runoff in excess of one-half
inch (1/2"), a drywell structure is located within the grassed infiltration
area to handle the excess runoff. In Idaho, these structures are regarded as
class V(e) injection wells and they are discussed in detail in subsection 11-
13G-3F of this chapter.
      Regarding class V(e) injection wells, the Idaho Code (title 42, chapter
39), states: "the ground waters of this state to be a public resource which
must be protected against unreasonable contamination or deterioration of
quality to preserve such waters for diversion to beneficial uses".
"Contamination" as defined by the statute means:
"the introduction into the natural ground waters of any physical, chemical,
biological, or radiological substance or matter in water which may:
Cause a violation of Drinking Water Standards; or
Adversely affect the health of the public; or
Adversely affects a designated and protected use of the State's ground water."
      6.   Permitting of class V(e) shallow injection wells (drywells) is not
required; however, they must be inventoried (registered) with IDWR. They are
also subject to IDHW rules for individual subsurface sewer disposal systems.
      7.   Because of these restrictions, other types of overflow controls may
be required in conjunction with GIAs. Within the site it may be more desirable
to divert any overflow into the natural surface drainage system than into an
injection well in order to safeguard the quality of the ground water. This
depends on the quality of the storm water entering the GIA. Factors such as
ground level soil quality in the upstream areas, barrier condition and
effectiveness, environmental sensitivity of the downstream areas, and soil
drainage and filtration capabilities at drywell depth must be considered in
determining which approach to take. PHD and IDWH-DEQ should be consulted to
help resolve this question if it arises.
      8.   Within the site, GIAs shall be designed to store and treat the first
one-half inch (1/2") (0.04 feet) of runoff. Following the requirements stated
in article G of this chapter, however, the GIA and adjacent land and
improvements shall not be damaged in any manner by the peak runoff flow from a
25-year storm event. In areas where barrier erodability and integrity is an
issue (soil barriers especially), the design storm shall be a 50-year event.
      9.   Grassed infiltration areas shall be a maximum of eight inches (8")
deep, calculated as the difference between the low point of the grassed
infiltration area and the inlet of the overflow structure. The GIA's cross
sectional area shall be flat bottomed, having a permissible average depth of
six inches (6"). Use of GIAs with a triangular, elliptical, or rounded cross
sections should be avoided. Swales with rounded shaped cross sections may be
used for conveyance of the storm water provided the swale's area is not used in
the calculation for the percolation area for the GIA. The maximum side slope
for a GIA shall be three (3) horizontal to one vertical (3:1). Lower side
slopes of four (4) horizontal to one vertical (4:1) or five (5) horizontal to
one vertical (5:1) are preferred. Consideration should be given to integrating
the GIA into the overall landscape design in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
      10.   The ICP may require soil tests to ensure that the soil is capable
of assimilating the contaminants in the runoff and will percolate the runoff at
an acceptable rate (i.e., that which will infiltrate the given depth of water
in a 24 hour period under optimum, nonfrozen conditions).
      11.   One test each for cation exchange capacity (CEC) 1  and soil
organic matter 2  may be required for each GIA of one thousand five hundred
(1,500) square feet or less. As additional set of tests may be required for
each additional two thousand (2,000) square feet or fraction thereof. Tests
shall be performed on a well mixed composite sample consisting of the top six
inches (6") of soil from at least four (4) cores uniformly distributed over the
infiltration area. If the average cation exchange capacity is fifteen (15)
milliequivalents per one hundred grams (100 g) or more, or the soil is two
percent (2%) organic carbon or more, the soil will be considered suitable for
storm water treatment. Test results shall be reported in the storm water
management plan (see article C of this chapter).
      12.   Where existing data is sufficient to assure that the soil type on
the site meets the requirements for contaminant removal and percolation (as
described above), the planning administrator may waive the testing
requirements.
      13.   To handle runoff volumes greater than that from the first one-half
inch (1/2"), a drywell or overflow structure should be placed at a level
equivalent to the ponded depth of the storm water runoff, in a static
condition, received from the first one-half inch (1/2"). The overflow or
drywell inlet should be located near the inlet of the ponded area, off to one
side of the flow pattern. This will preclude the mixing of the high pollutant,
"first flushed" ponded water with more dilute continued runoff in the
infrequent case of a storm event above the design storm value. If an overflow
diversion to the natural drainage system is being used, it should be located in
a similar fashion within the GIA to avoid sending the "first flushed" water
downstream. When the inlet structure is located within the GIA, the slopes
around the inlet shall be no greater than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1).
The drywell or structural system constructed to handle the excess volume of
runoff shall be designed in conformance with the standards in article G of this
chapter (and the handbook). When drywell structures are used in combination
with GIA storage, a simplified routing technique, known as the bowstring method
for detention basin design, can sometimes be used to reduce the number of
drywells required 1 .
      14.   If additional ponded depth over four inches (4") is designed, it
should be recognized that the life of the grass in the infiltration area may be
shortened. The developer may want to increase the surface area (lower the
flooded depth) to extend the life span of the infiltration area. Properly
designed, a GIA should provide twenty to thirty (20–30) years of effective
contaminant removal in areas where there are no concentrated levels of
contaminants. Effective GIA contaminant removal life span within the site may
be much shorter and should be monitored regularly.
   B.   Maintenance:
      1.   Sediment Removal: Proper maintenance of GIAs is critical. The
infiltration areas should be inspected by the owner (or assignee approved by
the planning administrator, see article E of this chapter) semiannually as a
minimum and after major storm events which approach or exceed the design storm
event. Sediment removal should be accomplished when the sediment is dry enough
to crack and readily separates from the floor of the basin. Proper handling and
disposal (at the Page site) methods for the collected sediments shall be
adhered to.
      2.   Grass Maintenance: The sod or grass should be maintained as needed
to control weed growth and maintain the health of the grass. This will include
mowing and minimal amounts of fertilizer. (Chemical fertilizers or pesticides
shall not be used within vegetated buffer zones or otherwise within 100 feet of
permanent surface waters.) It is preferable that the soil mantle provide the
nutrients necessary for the health of the grass to avoid the potential for
leaching from the fertilization process. Selection of the grass in the design
process should include consideration of those varieties of grass which are
suited to the site's climatological and soil conditions, providing low
maintenance, drought resistance, low pH tolerance, or other desirable
characteristics (i.e., red top, Timothy, Canada bluegrass, carrex spp.) 1 .
      3.   Renovation:
         a.   When the GIA has reached the end of its useful life, it shall be
renovated. The useful life will be considered to have ended when water remains
standing in the GIA more than seventy two (72) hours following the end of a
runoff event or when the cover material dies, whether due to the build up of
toxic materials in the soil or any other cause, or if soil tests reveal lead
concentrations in excess of one thousand (1,000) ppm. Access control may be
needed if contaminant levels are expected to reach this level frequently or
before soil removal is effected.
         b.   When infiltration fails, renovation shall be accomplished by any
needed action from standard soil aeration to removal of the sod layer,
scarification of the underlying soil, removal and replacement of soil and
replacement of the sod layer.
         c.   When the cover material dies, the sod and at least six inches
(6") of soil shall be removed from the affected area and disposed of at an
approved site. The soil shall be replaced, graded, and a new cover material
planted, or sod applied.
   C.   Roof Runoff: Runoff from the roofs and buildings shall be discharged to
GIAs when possible, rather than into drywells or off site. Expected volumes of
runoff generated from roofs shall be considered in GIA design.
   D.   Sand And Silt Traps: If gravel roads, driveways, or parking areas are
utilized within the development, it will be necessary to install a sand and
silt trap upstream of the GIA. Storm water studies have indicated large
quantities of sand and silt are washed off gravel structures. This phenomenon
could significantly decrease the life of grass percolation areas by covering
grass and filling low areas which would otherwise hold runoff.
   E.   Grassed Swales And Gutters: The use of grassed swales and gutter areas
as a method of conveyance of storm water runoff would, in most storm events,
serve as an additional infiltration area, reducing the volume which would need
treatment in the GIA. Under certain circumstances though, these conveyance
systems could lose their ability to percolate water overloading the GIAs
downstream. In late fall or early spring, frozen soil conditions may not allow
the grassed swales or gutter areas to percolate runoff. In this instance, the
downslope grassed infiltration area will have to be designed with additional
capacity to serve as a storage area for runoff. The use of grassed swale
conveyance should receive additional attention during design and construction
if their area and storage capacity is a factor in the overall GIA. Only those
swales which are flat bottomed and meet the other design criteria for grassed
infiltration areas shall be considered as a part of percolation area.
   F.   Spill Control Requirements: Special considerations need to be addressed
for storm water runoff from areas within commercial and industrial developments
where chemical spills may occur. Specific problem areas include outdoor loading
docks and outdoor chemical storage facilities. Design of facilities for these
situations will be addressed on a site specific basis by the planning
administrator.
      In the event of a toxic material(s) spill within a GIA, the polluted
grass and soil shall be replaced and disposed of in an approved manner. This
accomplishes two (2) goals:
      1.   Removal of the toxic material from the site.
      2.   Removal and replacement of the dead grass to maintain an effective
infiltration area.

11-13F-3: DESIGN EQUATIONS AND EXAMPLES FOR GIAs:
   A.   Obviously, design of the GIA is site specific. In one development, the
site topography and layout may readily allow the use of regular geometric
shapes for the design of the impervious surface areas or GIAs. In other cases,
the site topography may not allow design using standard geometric shapes or
patterns. The equations listed below or a combination of these equations should
provide a basis for the developer to evaluate the characteristics for
acceptable GIAs given a defined impervious surface on a site specific basis.
See figure 1 for an example of a uniform rectangular GIA.
   B.   As mentioned above, the GIA shall be designed to store and treat the
first one-half inch (1/2") of runoff draining from a developed, impervious
surface area (ISA) from any storm event. Impervious surface areas shall include
paved or graveled roads, driveways, parking area, and walkways, and roof areas.
Using the concept of storage volume as the basis for the GIA design yields the
following equation:
 
           VGIA = R x AISA
Where:
 VGIA = Volume of the GIA, in cubic feet (ft3).
 R    = Depth of runoff, in feet (ft) (i.e., 1/2 inch equals 0.04 feet), and
 AISA = Impervious surface area, in square feet (ft2).
 
      1.   The volume of a GIA, with a flat bottom and uniform width, can be
determined by multiplying the basin cross sectional area by the length of the
basin. In this case, the above equation becomes:
 
            AXGIA x LGIA = R x AISA
Where:
 AXGIA = Cross sectional area of the GIA, in square feet (ft2) and
 LGIA  = Length of GIA, in feet (ft)

TRAPEZOIDAL CROSS SECTION
Figure 1 - Example of an impervious surface area and grassed infiltration area
showing characteristics used in design equations.
      2.   If the impervious area and the GIA are rectangular in area and the
GIA has a trapezoidal cross section, the relationship in the above equation
becomes:
  1/2(WT+WB)GIA x DGIA x LGIA = RxWISA x LISA
Where:
 WTGIA = Distance across the top of the GIA, in feet (ft).
 WBGIA = Distance across the bottom of the GIA, in feet (ft).
 DGIA  = Depth of the GIA, at deepest point, in feet (ft).
 LGIA  = Length of the GIA, in feet (ft).
 R     = Depth of runoff, in feet (ft).
 WISA  = Width of the ISA, in feet (ft).
 LISA  = Length of the ISA, in feet (ft).
 
   C.   This will work for a basic calculation of the area. For the final
design the developer should calculate the area based on the actual area of the
circular sector.
   D.   In most cases where GIAs are used along roadsides, the slope limitation
will be the controlling factor in design of the GIA width.

11-13G-1: INTRODUCTION:
   As the population density and land values increase, the effects of
uncontrolled runoff become an economic burden and a serious threat to the
health and well being of a community and its citizens. This is especially true
in an area with the environmental circumstances of the site. Therefore, the
focus of storm water management is to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the general public, and mitigate property damage by reducing the frequency
and severity of flooding, and limit, insofar as possible, the migration of
heavy metal contaminants and their direct contact with the public. Estimating
the frequency and severity of future flooding events makes systematic planning
and installation of structural and nonstructural measures to reduce these
hazards to an acceptable level available to the designer. Additionally,
treatment of storm water to improve its quality is now required at federal,
state, and local levels to control contaminants and prevent degradation of
public water sources (GIAs and sediment removal).
   Studies in other parts of the country indicate that for a basin of one
square mile that is completely storm sewered and whose surface is completely
(or 100 percent) impervious, the mean annual flood (approximately the two (2)-
year flood) is about eight (8) times larger than for the natural basin. The
mean annual flood from a basin of one square mile that is completely storm
sewered but zero percent (0%) impervious is about 1.7 times as large as the
natural basin. The mean annual flood for a basin which is completely impervious
but not sewered is about two and a half (2.5) times as large as for the natural
basin. Information of this type is unavailable regarding discharges from
urbanized areas in Idaho 1 .
   A.   "Precipitation", whether it occurs as rain or snow, is the source of
surface runoff in watersheds. The extent of the storm and the distribution of
rainfall during the storm are two (2) major factors which affect the rate of
peak runoff.
      1.   The storm distribution can be thought of as a measure of how the
rate of rainfall, or "intensity", varies within a given time interval. For
example, within a given twenty-four (24) hour period, a measurable amount of
precipitation may have been recorded. However, this precipitation may have
occurred over the entire twenty-four (24) hour period or just within one hour.
These two (2) scenarios represent entirely different storm distributions.
      2.   The size of the storm is described by the length of time over which
the precipitation occurs, the total amount of precipitation occurring and how
often this same size of storm would be expected to occur (its "frequency"). A
ten years (10)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm is a storm producing a
measured intensity of rain in twenty four (24) hours with a ten percent (10%)
chance of occurrence in any given year. Thus a one hundred (100)-year, twenty-
four (24)-hour storm is a storm producing a measured intensity of rain in
twenty-four (24) hours with a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
year.
      3.   The "time of concentration" is that time it takes for water to
travel from the most distant part of the watershed to the point of interest.
The time of concentration affects the peak rate of runoff and shape of the
hydrograph.
      4.   A streamflow or discharge "hydrograph" is a graph or table showing
the flow rate as a function of time at a given location on the stream or for a
watershed. In effect, the hydrograph is "an integral expression of the
physiographic and climatic characteristics that govern the relations between
rainfall and runoff of a particular drainage basin" 2 .
      5.   "Antecedent moisture content" is the existing soil moisture content
resulting from the amount of precipitation occurring during the preceding five
(5) days. This content, especially when close to saturation, is a very
important feature in the process of runoff generation.
      6.   The "infiltration and percolation rates" of soils indicate their
potential to absorb precipitation and thereby reduce the volume of runoff. In
general, the higher the rate of infiltration, the lower quantity of storm
runoff. Fine textured soils such as clay produce a higher rate of runoff than
do coarse textured soils such as gravelly sand.
      7.   The "type of cover" and its hydrologic condition affects the runoff
volume. Vegetation, including the ground litter, forms numerous IC barriers
along the path of the land which slows the water down and reduces the volume of
runoff. Fallow land yields more runoff than forests or grassland for a given
soil type. Development reduces the natural storage and infiltration increasing
the amount of runoff.
      8.   Plants transpire moisture into the atmosphere creating a moisture
deficiency in the soil which must be replaced by some portion of the
precipitation before runoff occurs. The canopy provided by the foliage and
ground litter allow the soil to retain its infiltration potential. Some
moisture is retained on the surface of the foliage, evaporating back to the
atmosphere. Other portions of the intercepted precipitation take so long to
drain from the plants to the soil that it is withheld from the initial period
of runoff.
      9.   "Surface depression storage" begins when the precipitation exceeds
infiltration. "Overland flow" starts when surface depressions are full. The
water in depression storage is not available as direct runoff.
      10.   In wetlands, or on very flat areas where ponding occurs within a
watershed, a considerable amount of surface runoff may be retained in temporary
storage, thus reducing the runoff.
   B.   "Steep and unstable slopes" present additional hydrologic problems. It
should be recognized that while a certain site may be stable under natural
conditions, the same site with steeper slopes may have increased erosion
potential and an unstable slope when the site is developed. Slope and soils are
in balance with vegetation, underlying geologic structure, and the ground and
surface hydrologic environment in its natural, predeveloped state. Any
development will permanently alter this natural equilibrium and may affect the
stability of the slope.
      1.   Slope stability is a relative measure of the earth's resistance to
physical change. Natural processes such as wind, rain, runoff, ground water
conditions, or human influenced processes such as the removal of surface
vegetation or the soil mantle result in erosion, downcutting, slumping, and
sliding of the slope.
      2.   Development design on slopes is influenced by the potential for
damage which result from such processes. The relative risk to life or property
may have no influence on the design or may be so great that development on a
particular site should be abandoned. In all cases, special engineering
considerations should be integrated into development of the site to provide an
acceptable level of risk.

  13-2G-5H of this article.
11-13G-2: CLIMATIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION OF THE DESIGN STORM:
   A.   The general climate of the Idaho Panhandle is transitional between a
north Pacific coastal type and a continental type. The Pacific influence is
particularly noted by an autumn and winter maximum in low type cloudiness and
precipitation. These are enhanced by the mountainous topography and its forced
uplift of moist airflow 1 . Precipitation increases may be expected from this
uplift. In Shoshone County, this orographic effect is strongly evident with
average annual precipitation in the lower valleys of thirty to thirty five
inches (30–35") increasing to fifty five to sixty five inches (55–65") in the
adjacent mountainous area 2 . The cloudiest, wettest months are usually
November, December, and January. (See figure 6-1, the mean annual precipitation
map attached to ordinance 364, appendix B, on file in the office of the city
clerk.)
      1.   a.   In the city of Kellogg between the years of 1905 and 1992,
there were four (4) storm events which exceeded two inches (2") of
precipitation in a twenty-four (24) hour period with the extreme being four
inches (4") on December 9, 1987. The high monthly total in Kellogg was 12.28
inches in December 1933.
         b.   Wallace recorded ten (10) events between 1931 and 1992 which
exceed two inches (2") in a twenty-four (24) hour period with a high of 3.18
inches on November 26, 1960, and a high monthly total of 14.56 inches during
January of 1974.
         c.   Mullan recorded two (2) events between 1972 and 1992 which
exceeded two inches (2") in a twenty four (24) hour period with a high of 3.17
inches on February 16, 1986, and a high monthly total of 10.2 inches in the
month of November 1990. These precipitation totals are in inches of water but
may have come in the form of snow or rain.
      The following twenty-four (24)-hour duration storm event frequencies
shall be used for design purposes in the site:
Table 6-B1: Bunker Hill Area Storm Event Frequency
 
Event Frequency Precipitation Depth
2-year          1.6 inches
10-year         2.4 inches
25-year         2.8 inches
50-year         3.1 inches
100-year        3.6 inches
 
      These event frequencies are from the national oceanic and atmospheric
administration (NOAA) 1973, "Precipitation-Frequency Atlas Of The Western
U.S.", NOAA atlas 2, volume V-Idaho, National Weather Service, Silver Spring,
Maryland. The data is from Kellogg, ID 1933-1954 daily precipitation data,
state climatologist, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID.
      2.   In Idaho, most of the extremely high rates of runoff of record are
caused by intense thunderstorms. Portions of Shoshone County area considered to
be susceptible to flooding from intense thunderstorms and meltoff events. The
south fork of the Coeur d'Alene River creates a substantial floodplain as it
passes through the site and areas of it are designated as such by the national
flood insurance program (NFIP). These storm cells are often small and may be
confined to a small portion of the basin, but produce rates of runoff which are
much higher than typical precipitation events 1 . June, July, and August are
normally the peak months for thunderstorm activity in the Idaho Panhandle with
an average of three (3) thunderstorms per month 2 .
      3.   Occasionally, in the spring climatic conditions (frozen ground,
rising air temperatures, increasing wind velocities, abundant snowpack, and
rain) may combine to produce high rates of runoff. As the temperature warms,
the snow melts, when temperatures drop below freezing again the melt water
freezes in place forming an impermeable frozen barrier. Even the most permeable
alluvial deposits or basaltic surfaces are no longer able to infiltrate runoff.
If additional snowfall or rain follow, high rates of runoff may result (see
figure 6-2 attached to ordinance 364, appendix B, on file in the office of the
city clerk).
   B.   Given the varied topography and precipitation rates within Shoshone
County, the environmental concerns, the susceptibility to flooding from intense
thunderstorms, the possibility of spring flooding from abundant snowfall and
climatic conditions, a peak runoff design storm with a twenty-five (25)-year
reoccurrence level is considered to be prudent for storm water management
designs in areas of the site which do not have soil barriers. All areas within
the site which do have soil barriers must be designed to withstand a storm of
fifty (50)-year reoccurrence.

11-13G-3: ENGINEERING STANDARDS:
   The standards established by this chapter are intended to represent the
minimum design standards for the construction of storm drainage facilities and
stream channel improvements. Compliance with these standards does not relieve
the designer of the responsibility to apply conservative, sound professional
judgment to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.
These are minimum design standards and should be considered the lowest
acceptable limits in design. Special site conditions and environmental
constraints may require a greater level of protection than would normally be
required under these standards.
   The design policies and standards contained herein are intended to serve as
a basic guide in design work; however, they are not to be considered
inflexible. They are also not intended to be a substitute for engineering
knowledge, experience or judgment. When it is deemed necessary or desirable to
deviate from these design policies and standards, the developer shall submit
plans which show compliance with at least the minimum design standards for
approval from the planning administrator.
   A.   Storm Water Control: The rate of runoff from any proposed land
development shall not exceed the rate of runoff for the design storm prior to
the proposed land development.
      1.   Restriction of storm water runoff on the proposed land development
shall be controlled by structural measures and best management practices
(BMPs). Structural measures include collection systems, conveyance systems and
storage (retention/detention) systems with treatment processes. BMPs are low
structural or nonstructural alternatives designed to control the runoff volume
from the source and improve the runoff water quality. Grassed infiltration
areas are recognized as a nonstructural, low cost BMP, with high levels of
contaminant removal (see article D of this chapter).
      2.   Runoff cannot be diverted in the proposed development and released
to downstream property at locations not receiving runoff prior to the proposed
development unless an easement, consent, and on site retention is provided by
the downstream property owner and approval is granted by the planning
administrator.
      3.   a.   For sites with tributary basins ten (10) acres or less and
slopes of zero to ten percent (0–10%), an allowable runoff rate shall be
limited to the predevelopment peak runoff for a twenty-five (25)-year storm. If
limiting the runoff to this level is unfeasible for some reason, it must be
demonstrated to the planning administrator in detail in the storm water control
plan. Other alternatives shall be discussed and analyzed in detail for possible
downstream locations and repercussions of increased runoff before any permit is
issued to the developer. Construction of structures for controlling any
increase of runoff from a site may be required of the developer by the planning
administrator. The peak runoff rate shall be computed using the rational method
(see subsection 11-13G-4B of this article).
         b.   For sites with tributary basins ten (10) acres or less and slopes
of ten to forty percent (10–40%), an allowable runoff rate shall be limited to
the predevelopment peak runoff for a 50-year storm. Other alternatives shall be
discussed and analyzed in detail for possible downstream locations and
repercussions of increased runoff before any permit is issued to the developer.
Construction of structures for controlling any increase of runoff from a site
may be required of the developer by the planning administrator. The peak runoff
rate shall be computed using the soil conservation service TR-55 method (see
subsection 11-13G-4C of this article).
         c.   For sites with tributary basins greater than ten (10) acres and
slopes of ten to forty percent (10–40%), an allowable runoff rate shall be
limited to the predevelopment peak runoff for a 50-year storm. Other
alternatives shall be discussed and analyzed in detail for possible downstream
locations and repercussions of increased runoff before any permit is issued to
the developer. Construction of structures for controlling any increase of
runoff from a site may be required of the developer by the planning
administrator. The peak runoff rate shall be computed using the soil
conservation service TR-55 method.
      4.   The rainfall intensity shall be obtained from the Idaho
transportation department's intensity-duration-frequency charts or table 6-1.
These charts are based on U.S. weather bureau records. The state of Idaho has
been divided into different intensity-duration-frequency zones (IDF zones). For
the site, the IDF zone E or F may be applicable depending on the geographic
location of the site. A map of Idaho delineating the IDF zones and the IDF
charts for zones E and F are shown in figures 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7,
respectively.
      5.   Other hydrologic methods may be appropriate for determination of
runoff rate; however, it is strongly recommended that the designer consult with
the planning administrator and all federal, state, or local authorities prior
to beginning hydrology studies for the project if an alternate hydrologic
method is selected.
      6.   Developments shall be engineered and constructed to provide control
of the quality and quantity of storm water runoff during and after
construction. The on site drainage system including conveyance systems,
detention/retention systems, pollution control, and emergency overflow elements
must be properly designed and sized to handle runoff from the site and
conveyance through the site.
      7.   Appropriate easements and rights of way shall be established by the
developer to the satisfaction of the planning administrator through federal,
state and local agencies.
      8.   a.   Off site storm water runoff passing through the site shall be
conveyed by hydraulically adequate conveyance systems and shall pick up any
sediments from the site during its passage through it.
         b.   Off site surface water (streams) entering the site shall be
received and discharged at the existing locations with adequate energy
dissipaters to minimize downstream damage. There shall be no diversion at
either of these points.
      9.   Storm water detention/retention systems and culverts shall be
designed to permit storage and conveyance capacity as required in these
standards. In addition, these structures shall be designed to provide a
satisfactory level of protection for the 100-year storm. This design standard
will assure a level of protection for all habitable structures and assure
reasonable access is available to all habitable structures during the 100-year
storm event.
      10.   Outfalls must conform to the requirements of the planning
administrator and all federal, state, and local authorities.
      11.   For any future developments, class V(e), shallow injection wells
shall be authorized for disposal of storm water runoff provided the effluent
from the well meets the water quality standards set by the department of water
resources under the rules and regulations for "Construction And Use Of
Injection Wells". Attention shall be paid to the surrounding upstream soil
types and the possibility of heavy metal contaminants entering the ground water
through any injection well.
      12.   a.   Any and all stream work shall be consistent with the
requirements of the planning administrator and any or all other regulatory
agencies including, but not limited to, the environmental protection agency,
Idaho department of water resources, Idaho department of lands, Idaho
department of fish and wildlife, Idaho department of environmental quality,
Panhandle health district, and army corps of engineers.
         b.   For purposes of these standards, "stream" shall mean any and all
surface water routes generally consisting of a channel having a bed, banks,
and/or sides in which surface waters flow in draining from higher to lower
land, both perennial and intermittent; the channel, banks, and intervening
artificial components.
      13.   Lands that lie within "flood hazard zones" as delineated on
appropriate maps prepared by the federal insurance administrator, shall comply
with the regulations of the national flood insurance program (NFIP).
      14.   The planning administrator shall be consulted on the availability
and applicability of computer programs for hydraulic design. The Idaho
transportation department maintains a list of applicable computer programs for
hydrologic applications. Programs identified or provided by the planning
administrator or Idaho transportation department may be used for design.
Responsibility for the use of these programs and their accuracy will be borne
by the designer. Programs which have been used to develop the remedial studies
for the site will be considered as acceptable and are as follows:

Hydrograph And Sedimentgraph Package" (used for hillside runoff/sedimentation
study).
      Table 6-1 provides the minimum storm design frequency for hydraulic
structures as approved by the planning administrator. The designer may find
that the federal, state, or local ordinances will require more restrictive
design frequencies.
   B.   Storm Sewers: A storm sewer is a system of drainage conduits that
carries surface drainage or street wash, from catch basins or surface inlets,
to an outfall. All storm sewer designs will be based on engineering analysis
which takes into consideration total drainage areas, runoff rates, pipe
capacity, foundation conditions, soil characteristics, pipe strength, potential
construction problems, and any other factors pertinent to design.
      Storm sewer design is based on the calculation of peak runoff from an
area and design of a pipe system to carry the runoff. The peak runoff design
storm shall be the 25-year storm except in areas where soil IC barriers are
present, where the peak runoff design storm shall be the 50-year storm.
      1.   Minimum design standards for storm sewers:
         a.   Future Expansion Of The Site: If it is anticipated that the site
or storm sewer system may be expanded in the future, provisions for the
expansion shall be incorporated into the current design.
         b.   Location Of The System: The location of the storm sewer system as
it relates to the overall site design and delineation of boundaries for
differing regulatory agencies (federal, state, or local) shall be clearly
defined.
         c.   Pipe Alignment: No storm sewer pipe alignment in a drainage
easement shall have its centerline closer than five feet (5') to a private
property line.
         d.   Soil Conditions: Surface and subsurface drainage shall be
provided to assure stable soil conditions necessary for adequate soil bearing
capacity and protection of fills or cuts. Soil contaminant migration due to
surface or subsurface drainage shall be avoided in all circumstances.
         e.   Profile Of Grade For The Storm Sewer: A profile of the pipe
system shall be provided showing invert elevations, manholes, or catch basins
showing top and bottom elevations, existing and finished groundline or grade
elevations, etc.
         f.   Minimum Pipe Slope: Minimum pipe slope shall be used to maintain
minimum velocities of flow. All storm sewers shall be designed and constructed
to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two and a half
feet (2.5') per second.
         g.   Minimum Pipe Diameters: The minimum pipe diameter shall be twelve
inches (12") for storm sewers and irrigation systems, except that single
laterals less than fifty feet (50') long may be eight inches (8") in diameter.
Pipe carrying drainage from irrigated lands shall be considered as culverts and
the appropriate minimum size used.
         h.   Inlet Spacing And Capacity: Inlet spacing on roads and highways
shall be designed and constructed according to the requirements of the planning
administrator, and all federal, state, and local authorities.
         i.   Junction Spacing For Catch Basins And Manholes: Catch basins or
manholes shall be provided for breaks in grade, or alignment or along pipe
runs. For pipe runs, junctions shall not exceed three hundred feet (300') for
pipes smaller than forty eight inches (48") or five hundred feet (500') for
pipes greater than forty eight inches (48").
         j.   Grades Through Junctions: Grades through junctions shall be
consistent with the standards of the planning administrator.
         k.   Minor Head Loss Calculations: Minor head loss calculations shall
be included in the storm water management plan. In some cases, head losses
occurring at pipe junctions may not be negligible. The design shall provide
calculations for the head losses in the following cases:
            (1)   Very high velocities with the inlet and outlet pipes forming
a sharp or acute angle at the junction.
            (2)   Changes in pipe diameter.
            (3)   Abrupt changes in slope.
         l.   Outfalls: Outfalls must conform to the requirements of the
planning administrator and all federal, state, and local authorities.
         m.   Siltation Basins: Siltation basins shall be used to prevent
clogging or silting of the storm sewer lines or the migration of silts which
have been contaminated by heavy metals or other substance in the soil and shall
be incorporated with the use of cast metal inlets, concrete inlets, or any
other inlet which does not have a silt basin.
         n.   Project Life: Project life of materials for the purpose of
selecting storm sewer materials shall be one hundred (100) years.
   C.   Culverts: A culvert is a conduit used as an artificial channel under a
roadway or embankment to maintain flow from a natural channel or drainage
ditch. A properly designed culvert will carry the flow without causing damaging
backwater, excessive constriction, or excessive outlet velocities. Designing
culverts involves the determination of design flow, hydraulic performance,
economy, pipe materials, horizontal and vertical location, environmental
considerations, and end designs.
      The culvert design should include the profile of the culvert flow line
(invert), culvert length, allowable headwater depths for the design flood and
the 100-year flood, roadway or embankment cross sections, and a roadway or
embankment profile showing the height of the fill. The hydraulic features of
the downstream controls, tailwater or backwater must be given.
      There are certain cases where hydraulic capacity is not the only
consideration for determining the size of a waterway opening. Fish passage
requirements may dictate a different type of crossing. Wetland preservation may
require a culvert be upsized. The designer shall follow the regulations and
recommendations of the appropriate authority (federal, state, local) and
document the information in the storm water management plan.
      1.   Minimum Design Standards For Culverts:
         a.   Minimum Culvert Size: The minimum diameter of culvert pipes under
the main roadway shall be eighteen inches (18") until a length of seventy feet
(70') is reached. All culverts over seventy feet (70') shall be twenty four
inches (24") or more in diameter or shall conform to the requirements of the
federal, state, or local authority, whichever is applicable. Culvert pipes from
grated inlets or catch basins in the roadway have a minimum diameter of eight
inches (8"). Culvert pipe under driveways, roadways, approaches, and median
drains shall have a minimum diameter of eight inches (8"). Pipe draining
irrigated land shall be sized using the minimum culvert sizes.
         b.   Allowable Headwater: All culverts shall be designed to carry the
design frequency flood with a headwater (HW) depth not greater than 1.25 times
the culvert depth (D). The intent of this limitation is to prevent the
headwater from materially increasing the size of the flooded upstream area
under normal conditions. It must be determined in the field what headwater
depths can be permitted for the design flood and the 100-year flood. Allowable
headwater depths are determined by the field conditions and are not associated
with design criteria.
         c.   Level Of Protection: This design standard shall assure a level of
protection for all habitable structures and assure reasonable access is
available to all habitable structures during the one hundred (100)-year storm
event (i.e., the culvert should pass the 100-year storm without damaging or
eroding the roadway or embankment).
         d.   Depth Of Tailwater: Depth of tailwater is important in
determining the hydraulic capacity of culverts flowing with outlet control.
When the downstream water surface elevation is controlled by a downstream
obstruction or backwater and the tailwater at the outlet of the culvert exceeds
the height of the water outlet for the culvert barrel, the capacity of the
culvert is reduced. Field inspection of all major culvert locations should be
made during project design to evaluate the downstream controls and to assess
the potential discharge capacity of the culvert or the resulting headwater when
a culvert is flowing under the outlet control.
         e.   Velocity In Culverts: Due to its hydraulic characteristics, a
culvert will increase the velocity of flow over that in the natural channel.
High velocities (abrasive velocities) are most critical just downstream from
the culvert outlet where the erosion potential from the energy in the water is
enormous.
         f.   Placement Of Culverts: Culverts shall be placed on grades that
produce a nonsilting or nonabrasive velocity, three (3) to ten feet (10') per
second. Silting velocities may be overcome by raising the inlet of the culvert
above the stream invert to increase the grade and provide a siltation basin at
the inlet. Siltation basins upstream of the inlet may also be provided by
excavating a basin or using a concrete basin. Siltation basins must be large
enough to decrease velocities to two feet (2') per second but shall not short
circuit the flow over the top or along the sides of the embankment. Oversized
culverts may be used where silting will occur to prevent blocking and to
facilitate cleaning.
         g.   Abrasive Velocities: Abrasive velocities may be overcome by
raising the outlet to decrease the grade. Structural plate pipe may be provided
with extra thickness in the bottom plates to account for possible abrasion.
Concrete box culverts and concrete bases for arches may have steel inverts of
rails or beams, or extra slab thickness to resist abrasion.
         h.   Alignment And Grade: Culverts shall generally be placed on the
same alignment and grade as the natural streambed or channel to maintain the
natural drainage system. This avoids creating unnatural ponding at the inlet or
drops at the outlet.
         i.   Embankment Material: The embankment for the culvert shall consist
of nonerodable material and riprap or other outlet protection is essential. The
embankment material should be free draining and capable of withstanding
ponding.
         j.   Culvert Material: Concrete pipe may be used for any grade up to
ten percent (10%). Corrugated metal pipe may be used for grades up to twenty
percent (20%). For grade in excess of twenty percent (20%), the design and
material shall be approved by the planning administrator.
         k.   Minimum Cover: Minimum cover for a culvert within any roadway
embankment shall be one foot (1').
         l.   Constant Flow: Where a pipe flows at least three-quarters (3/4)
full over a period of a month or more during the year, gasketed corrugated
metal pipe (CMP), rubber gasket concrete or plastic pipe shall be required.
         m.   Project Life: Project life of culverts for the purposes of
selecting culvert materials shall be one hundred (100) years.
         n.   Minimum Spacing Of Multiple Culverts: Multiple culverts are
acceptable in special cases, but their general use is discouraged. When
multiple lines of pipe or pipe arch greater than forty eight inch (48")
diameter or span are used, they should be spaced so that the sides of the pipe
or arch are no closer than one-half (1/2) in diameter or three feet (3'),
whichever is less, so that sufficient space for compaction of the fill material
is available. For culvert diameters up to forty eight inches (48"), the minimum
distance between the sides of the pipe shall be no less than two feet (2').
         o.   Camber: If a large amount of settlement is anticipated due to
high fills, it may be necessary to add some camber to the culvert profile to
correct for settlement. A soils engineer shall be consulted at the planning
administrator's request as to the amount of camber which should be placed in a
culvert.
         p.   Moderate/High Fill Culverts: Culverts installed under moderate to
high fills can experience differential settlement. At the pipe ends, there is
no fill, at the centerline of the embankment the depth of the fill is at
maximum. The difference in surcharge pressure at the elevation of the culvert
causes the differential settlement. Consult a soils engineer for design of a
culvert under these conditions.
         q.   Culvert End Considerations: The type of end treatment used on a
culvert depends on many interrelated and sometimes conflicting considerations.
The designer must consider safety, aesthetics, debris capacity, hydraulic
efficiency, scouring, and economics.
            (1)   Projecting Ends: Projecting ends are the simplest and most
economical of all end treatment designs; however, projecting ends provide no
transition to prevent scouring at the outlet and buoyancy may become a problem
at the entrance. Projecting ends shall not be used in a highway "clear zone" as
designated by Idaho transportation department.
            (2)   Beveled End: For culverts thirty inches (30") or less in
diameter, a beveled end section shall be the preferred end treatment. The
standard bevel end section shall not be used on pipes laid on a skew of more
than thirty degrees (30°) from the perpendicular to the centerline of the
roadway.
            (3)   Flared End: A flared metal end section is a manufactured
culvert end that provides a simple transition from the culvert to the streambed
or drainage channel. It provides a hydraulic transition which allows the flow
to spread out and slow down before it is discharged into the watercourse.
Flared ends shall not be used for culverts greater than forty eight inches
(48") in diameter. Flared ends shall not be used in a highway "clear zone" as
designated by Idaho transportation department.
         r.   Headwalls: All pipes larger than thirty inches (30") in diameter
shall be beveled at the entrance to conform to the fill slope and provided with
a concrete headwall. Pipe culverts larger than seventy two inches (72") in
diameter shall have their inlet headwalls beveled, tapered or rounded to
improve the inlet flow characteristics. In addition to the headwall, riprap may
be required by the planning administrator.
         s.   Wingwalls: Wingwalls shall be used on reinforced concrete box
culverts. However, they may be modified for use on circular culverts in areas
with severe scour problems. The purpose is to retain and protect the embankment
and to provide a transition from the channel to the culvert.
         t.   Improved Inlets: When head losses in the culvert become critical,
the designer shall consider the use of the hydraulically improved inlet. These
inlets provide side transitions as well as top and bottom transitions that have
been designed to maximize the culvert capacity. However, it should be noted it
is generally less expensive to increase the size of the culvert by one or two
(2) sizes to achieve the same or greater benefits.
         u.   Energy Dissipaters: When the outlet velocities of a culvert or
storm sewer outfall are excessive for the site conditions, the designer shall
provide energy dissipaters for culvert outlets shall be used to prevent severe
scouring at the outlet. Debris and maintenance problems shall be addressed in
the design.
            (1)   Riprap: Riprap placed at the outlet of a culvert is the
simplest method of handling outlet velocities when the soils are unstable.
            (2)   Special Energy Dissipating Structures: Special energy
dissipating structures, including impact basins and stilling basins, shall meet
the requirements of the planning administrator and any or all federal, state,
or local authorities and shall be approved on a site specific basis.
         v.   Culvert Debris: Debris problems can cause even an adequately
designed culvert to experience hydraulic capacity problems. The culvert site is
a natural location for these materials to settle and accumulate. Debris may
consist of anything from limbs, sticks, orchard prunings to logs and trees.
Silt, sand, gravel, and boulders can also be classified as debris.
            (1)   There is no method to accurately predict debris problems.
Examining maintenance history for similar sites is probably the most reliable
way of determining potential problems. Requirements for debris deflectors,
racks, basins, or spillways will be addressed on a site specific basis by the
planning administrator.
   D.   Open Channel Flow: Open channel flow is encountered naturally in rivers
and streams. Artificial channels include irrigation channels, drainage ditches,
swales, or gutter flow for pavement drainage. Proper design requires that open
channels have sufficient hydraulic capacity to convey the magnitude of runoff
from the design storm. In the case of grassy swales, bank protection is also
required if the velocities are high enough to cause erosion or scouring.
      1.   Minimum Design Standards For Open Channel Flow:
         a.   Stream Velocities: Stream velocities are useful in determining
the hydraulic capacity of a channel and the need for erosion protection along
the banks. As the depth of the water in an open channel increases, the velocity
also increases. Maximum velocity in open channels shall be four feet (4') per
second.
         b.   Manning's Equation: Manning's equation shall be the method of
analysis for open channel flow. The trapezoid is the most often used for a
channel cross section. Manning's coefficients are provided in table 6-4.
         c.   Critical Depth: Occasionally, it is necessary to determine
critical depth in design of open channels. This will occur when the level of
the headwater is controlled by the entrance of the pipe or channel rather than
by the pipe or channel itself. Critical depth should always be calculated since
it may control (when critical depth is less than normal depth) the capacity of
the channel on a relatively steep slope (0.5–1.0 percent).
         d.   River Backwater Analysis: Natural river channels tend to be
highly irregular in shape so as simple analysis using Manning's equation, while
helpful for making an approximation, is not sufficiently accurate to determine
a river water surface profile. The planning administrator shall be consulted on
the availability and applicability of computer programs and data useful in
calculating a backwater profile. The Idaho transportation department maintains
a list of applicable computer programs. Programs provided by the planning
administrator and Idaho transportation department may be used for design.
Responsibility for the use of these programs and their accuracy will be borne
by the designer.
         e.   Stream Bank Stabilization: Stream banks shall be stabilized to
the planning administrator's satisfaction where degraded or impacted by the
development. Bank stabilization is required when design flow velocities of new
or existing channels exceed three feet (3') per second or erosive velocity for
the channel bed, whichever is smaller.
         f.   Existing Ditch Modification: Existing ditches shall be provided
with riprapped bottoms and side slopes at the discharge points of storm sewers
or culverts. The rock shall extend for a minimum of ten feet (10') downstream
from the end of the storm sewer or culvert.
         g.   Channel Modification: All channel sides and bottoms shall be
seeded, sodded, or riprapped as directed by the planning administrator.
         h.   Velocity Control: Check dams, pools, nonerosive drop structures,
or other means shall be used as necessary to control velocity.
   E.   Detention/Retention Facilities: The peak rate of runoff from a site
shall not be increased due to the proposed development for the design storm
unless it has been sufficiently demonstrated to the planning administrator that
no detrimental downstream effects will occur as a result and any structural
requirements to limit said effects have been met. Therefore, retention or
detention facilities will be required on the developed site.
      In certain situations, it is possible and even desirable to store a
volume of water before allowing it to discharge to the downstream drainage
courses. When this storage effect is properly considered, the design can reduce
the amount of peak flow released to the downstream drainage facility or
eliminate it altogether. Detention/retention facilities include GIAs, earthen
basins, shallow injection wells, and buried tanks or large diameter pipes.
      1.   Open or closed storage detention systems are desirable in the
overall management plan for the following reasons:
         a.   Prevention of storm water runoff in excess of predevelopment
runoff to downstream properties.
         b.   Reduction of flow rates in downstream drainage structures.
         c.   Reduction of frequency and capacity of infiltration, conveyance
and drainage systems on the site as a whole.
         d.   The size of pump stations could be designed with smaller pumps if
storage for the runoff was provided.
         e.   Existing culverts or storm sewers on site which would be
undersized may be made adequate if upstream storage were provided.
         f.   Allow any contaminated silts to settle out before the runoff is
released into local surface waters.
      Detention/retention facilities which are subject to collecting
contaminated sediments must either be cleaned on a frequent regular basis or
have some form of access control (fencing) around them. As maintenance often
has a tendency to be put off, access control is the preferred method of dealing
with the issue. Detention and retention facilities should be cleaned after all
storm events approaching the design intensity, bimonthly during the wet season,
and at the end of the winter as a minimum. Testing of collected sediments
should be performed annually for all such control facilities to determine the
level of contamination expected in the sediments collected in each structure.
All materials with lead levels in excess of three hundred fifty (350) ppm must
be disposed of at a PHD approved repository. All sediments collected in a given
control structure are to be considered as contaminated if no testing has been
performed at that location. If the sediments from a structure test less than
one hundred (100) ppm for two (2) consecutive years, then the sediments from
that structure shall be considered as clean and no further testing will be
required.
      2.   Liabilities and potential problems associated with detention systems
must also be considered:
         a.   There must be adequate space available for a storage basin.
         b.   The potential for damage from overtopping the design level of the
storage basin must be considered.
         c.   There is a potential safety hazard to the public for storage
basins which could become covered with several feet of water.
         d.   Basins subject to frequent flooding may lose natural vegetation
from the excessive amounts of water.
         e.   Accumulated sediments which may be contaminated by heavy metals
or have a low pH, posing a public health hazard.
      3.   Minimum design standards for detention/retention facilities:
         a.   An overflow type storage detention system which regulates the
rates of flow shall be the preferred storage facility. Landscaped facilities
such as parks and playfields are recommended for use as storm water detention
facilities unless the sediments are likely to contain heavy metals or have a
low pH.
         b.   All storage detention facilities shall be accessible for
maintenance and a regular maintenance schedule shall be submitted with the
operation and maintenance plan. Access for maintenance vehicles (generally 8 to
10 feet wide travel lane) shall be included in the design.
         c.   Storage detention facilities with side slopes steeper than five
(5) horizontal to one vertical shall be fenced as approved by the planning
administrator.
         d.   The reservoir routing method is straightforward and shall be used
for design of the storage detention facility. This method involves plotting an
inflow hydrograph for the future storm event, then superimposing an outflow
hydrograph over the inflow hydrograph. The area inscribed between the two (2)
graphs represents the volume to be stored in the facility. The inflow
hydrograph will be developed using the rational method (see below).
         e.   The outflow hydrograph will be dependent upon the particular
control structure selected as well as the depth of the water in the storage
detention basin. The actual shape of the outflow hydrograph can be developed by
an application of a technique known as reservoir routing.
         f.   Any detention or retention facility which is likely to accumulate
contaminated sediments shall have an impervious bottom and access control
(fence) to eliminate public contact with the sediments.
   F.   Shallow Injection Wells:
      1.   Shallow injection wells are any excavation or artificial opening
into the ground which meets the following four (4) criteria:
         a.   It is a bored, drilled, or excavated hole, a driven mine shaft;
         b.   It is deeper than its largest straight line surface dimension;
         c.   It is used for or intended to be used for injection; and
         d.   The well is less than or equal to eight (8) vertical feet of
depth below ground level. Catch basins with lateral subsurface infiltration
piping are also considered to be injection wells under subsection F1c of this
section.
      2.   Class V (e) shallow injection wells are used for the disposal of
nonhazardous, nonradioactive wastes such as clean storm water runoff and
irrigation wastewater. Regarding class V (e) injection wells the Idaho Code,
title 42, chapter 39, states: "the ground waters of this state to be a public
resource which must be protected against unreasonable contamination or
deterioration of quality to preserve such waters for diversion to beneficial
uses". Contamination as defined by the statute means:
"the introduction into the natural ground waters of any physical, chemical,
biological, or radiological substance or matter in water which may:
(1)   Cause a violation of Drinking Water Standards; or
(2)   Adversely affect the health of the public; or
(3)   Adversely affect a designated and protected use of the State's ground
water."
      3.   Minimum design standards for shallow injection wells:
         a.   The capacity of a site's subsurface soils to infiltrate storm
water from a shallow injection well shall be determined based on SCS soil
permeability criteria. Soil gradation (sieve analysis) determinations of
specific soils shall be required at the option of the planning administrator to
confirm SCS soil class criteria prior to injection well construction.
         b.   Class V (e), shallow injection wells are authorized by rule for
the life of the facility provided that the required inventory information is
furnished to the department of water resources and use of the well does not
contaminate a drinking water source.
         c.   The owner or operator of a proposed class V (e) injection well
shall submit the following inventory information to the director of the
department of water resources as a condition of authorization:
            (1)   Facility name and location;
            (2)   County in which the injection well(s) is (are) located;
            (3)   Location of the well(s) by legal description to the nearest
ten (10) acre tract, or by highway milepost where the well is owned or operated
by a state or local entity;
            (4)   Ownership of the wells;
            (5)   Name, address, and phone number of legal contact;
            (6)   Type or function of the well(s);
            (7)   Number of wells of each type; and
            (8)   Operation status of the well(s).
         d.   For any future developments, class V (e), shallow injection wells
shall be authorized for disposal of storm water runoff provided the effluent
from the well meets the water quality standards set by the department of water
resources under the rules and regulations for "Construction And Use Of
Injection Wells".
         e.   If the operation of a class V (e) injection well is causing or
may cause contamination of a drinking water source, the planning administrator,
or director of the department of water resources, shall require immediate
cessation of the injection activity.
   G.   Constructed Wetlands 1 : Manmade wetlands can provide significant
storage capacities for runoff and provide effective pollutant removal. Other
benefits include recreation and aesthetic possibilities. Studies have found
that controlled storm water retention in marshes has resulted in better
vegetative conditions which in turn enhanced storm water nutrient removal.
Other reports indicate removal of storm generated pollution has been achieved
by detention and natural treatment in small urban lakes.
      The use of wetlands, whether they be lakes, ponds, or marshes, is
straightforward from an engineering design standpoint. However, the
disadvantage of these types of systems is a considerable effort may be required
to maintain them in a healthy state. Wetlands can be seen to remove waterborne
pollutants principally through physical and chemical processes which are
substantially improved by biological processes associated with aquatic
vegetation. This vegetation is generally resistant to the pollutants found in
storm water; however, the interactions of various plant and animal species are
not completely understood and changes in this community structure may affect
the overall health, aesthetic character, and pollutant removal capacity of the
wetland.
      1.   Minimum design standards for constructed wetlands:
         a.   Constructed wetlands shall be approved on a site specific basis
by the planning administrator.
         b.   The designer shall be responsible for obtaining approval through
all federal, state, and local authorities.
         c.   Wetland design should utilize a team approach with expertise in
hydrology, water quality, soils, botany, wildlife ecology, landscape
architecture as well as design and construction engineering.
         d.   Water retention time (approximated by volume divided by outflow
rate) for particulate removal should be approximately one week. For removal of
nutrients and soluble pollutants, greater than two (2) weeks retention time
should be allowed.
         e.   Surface area (wet pool area divided by watershed or drainage
basin area) should be 0.01 minimum, but preferably greater than 0.025.
         f.   Optimum water depth distribution within a wetland is fifty
percent (50%) less than six inches (6") (a bench form), twenty five inches
(25") to one foot (1') and twenty five percent (25%), two (2) to three feet
(3').
         g.   Ideally a forebay would be constructed in the inlet channel prior
to the wetland area proper. The depth of this forebay should be approximately
three feet (3') and its surface area approximately twenty five percent (25%) of
the total wetland area.
         h.   Consider a liner if needed to maintain summer water and to
prevent ground water contamination.
         i.   To prevent flow short circuiting, place the outlet remote from
the inlet, minimize flow velocities, construct multicelled configuration, and
design a length to width rates of three to one (3:1) minimum, greater than five
to one (5:1) preferably.
         j.   For inlet design, use techniques that will minimize entrance
velocity and momentum such as level spreaders, enlarged inlet conveyance,
reduced inlet slope, and baffle islands or peninsulas.
         k.   Soils to be used for wetland construction should have moderate to
fine texture (loams) with relatively high muck. (This can be an important
source of plant "propagules".)
         l.   Soil and water pH should be circumneutral (6 to 8) with slightly
alkaline (7 to 8) best. Note that many of the soils located within the site
have low to very low pHs. As such, care should be taken to study the use of
wetlands as a contaminant removal technology in the site.
         m.   Plant selection principles center not around water quality goals,
but:
            (1)   Prospects for effective establishment and continued survival
under site conditions;
            (2)   Using native species;
            (3)   Avoiding invasive or nuisance species; and
            (4)   Selection to fulfill multiple objectives (if any).
         n.   Best pollutant removal plants are those dense, fine herbaceous
plants with good winter viability. Choices for specific pollutants (NW native
plants) include:
            (1)   For Metals Removal: Oenanthe sarmentosa (water parsley),
Spirea douglasii (hardback), Carex species (sedges), Elodea canadensis lemna
species (duckweeds), Nuphar species (water lilies), Scirpus species
(bulrushes), Typha species (cattails).
            (2)   For Oils And Other Organics: Plants that grow from basal
meristem- Juncus species (rushes), or Scirpus species (bulrushes).
         o.   Best results for establishing plantings are by using live plants
or dormant rhizomes from nurseries; obtaining plants from natural wetlands is
discouraged. Seeding offers lower prospects of success.
         p.   The designer shall provide a monitoring program for ensuring the
wetland functions as is intended in the design.

Notes
1    See subsection
  13-2G-5I of this article.
11-13G-4: HYDROLOGIC ANALYSIS METHODS:
   A.   Drainage Basin: The size and shape of the drainage basins are important
factors regardless of which method is used to determine the hydrologic
characteristics of the basin. Determination of the basin area should only
proceed after procurement of the best available topographic maps of the entire
area contributing surface runoff to the site. Outline the area on the map(s)
and determine the size in acres or square miles. Any areas that are known to be
noncontributing to surface runoff should be subtracted from the total drainage
area and justification given for this. The slope, length, and surface roughness
of the drainage basin or watershed affect the travel times for runoff.
   B.   Rational Method:
      1.   Purpose: The rational method is used to predict peak flows for small
drainage areas which can be either natural or developed. The greatest accuracy
is obtained for smaller drainage basins or for developed conditions with large
areas of impervious surfaces.
      2.   Drawbacks: Drawbacks of the rational method are:
         a.   It gives only the peak discharge and provides no information
about the time distribution of the storm runoff.
         b.   Selection of the variables for the formula is more an art of
judgment than a precise account of the antecedent moisture content or an aerial
distribution of rainfall intensity 1 .
      3.   Facility Design: Given these limitations, the rational method shall
only be used for design of storm water management facilities for drainage
basins ten (10) acres or less. However, for these areas, the formula is
accurate in determining the total runoff volume as well as peak discharges.
These two (2) factors will provide the designer with a basis for designing
GIAs, storm sewers, culverts, outfalls, open channels, etc.
      4.   Formula: The formula for the rational method is as follows:
    Q = CIA
Where:
 Q = Runoff in cubic feet per second (cfs).
 C = Runoff coefficient representing ratio of runoff to rainfall.
 I = Average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a particular duration
      storm event.
 A = Drainage area in acres.
 
      When several subareas within a drainage basin have different runoff
coefficients, the rational formula can be modified as follows:
 
Q = I(ΣCA)
Where:
 ΣCA = C1 x A1 + C2 x A2 + C3 x A3 + .............
 
      5.   Runoff Coefficients: The runoff coefficient represents the ratio of
runoff to rainfall. The rational method implies that this ratio is fixed for a
given drainage basin. In reality, the coefficient may vary with respect to
prior wetting and seasonal conditions.
      The coefficients in table 6-2 are applicable for peak storms of 10-year
frequency. Less frequent, higher intensity storms will require the use of
higher coefficients because infiltration and other losses have proportionally
smaller effect on the runoff. Conversely, long duration storms with low average
intensities would require the use of lower coefficients. Until such time as
coefficients are available for 25-year frequency storms, this table of
coefficients shall be used for Shoshone County areas.
      6.   Rainfall Intensity:
         a.   The rainfall intensity shall be obtained from the Idaho
transportation department's intensity-duration-frequency charts. These charts
are based on U.S. weather bureau records, and the state of Idaho has been
divided into different intensity-duration-frequency zones (IDF zones). For
Shoshone County IDF zone E, F, or H may be applicable depending on the
geographic location of the site.
         b.   When using these graphs, it should be noted that the data from
which they are derived is sporadic and much more information is needed for
short duration storms in order to obtain more accurate estimates.
         c.   A map of Idaho delineating the IDF zones and the IDF charts for
zones E, F, and H are shown in figures 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7,
respectively.
      7.   Time Of Concentration:
         a.   The time of concentration is that time it takes for water to
travel from the most distant part of the watershed to the point of interest.
The time of concentration affects the peak rate of runoff and shape of the
hydrograph.
         b.   Overland flow, storm sewer flow, and channel flow are three (3)
phases of runoff flow commonly used in computing travel time. In a given
watershed or drainage basin some areas would be dominated by overland (sheet)
flow while other areas would be dominated by channel flow. Developed drainage
basins may be further complicated by significant flows from storm sewers. The
time of concentration is equal to the sum of the travel times computed for each
subarea.
         c.   Special attention should be given to the computation of
concentration and travel time. Once storm drains are installed the flow
patterns may be changed so significantly that flow retardence cannot be
represented by factors based on runoff curve numbers or overland flow.
Velocities of flow through culverts and channels should be computed using
hydraulic procedures that take into consideration the characteristics of flow
paths.
         d.   An exception to this procedure may occur when a complex drainage
pattern exists. The designer should be cautious when two (2) or more subbasins
have different types of cover (i.e., different runoff coefficients). The most
common case would be a large paved area together with a long narrow flat strip
of natural area. In this case the designer should check the paved area and a
fraction of the natural area to determine if this combination would produce a
greater peak than the peak produced by using the longest time of concentration.
         e.   The procedure for determining the time of concentration is based
on the U.S. department of agriculture, soil conservation service method which
was originally developed from the Manning formula. It is sensitive to slope,
type of ground cover, and the size of channels.
 Tc = L   = L1.5
       KS5   KH5
Where:
 Tc = Time of concentration in minutes.
 L  = Length of the drainage basin area in feet.
 H  = Height of the drainage basin area in feet.
 K  = Ground cover coefficient in feet per minute.
 S  = Average slope (H/L) in feet per feet.
 n  = Manning roughness coefficient.
 
         (1)   The ground cover coefficient is provided in table 6-3.
         (2)   Manning's roughness coefficient is provided in table 6-4 (see
"Open Channel Flow").
   C.   Soil Conservation Service Method:
      1.   For watersheds or drainage basins greater than ten (10) acres, the
SCS, TR-55 1  method shall be used to calculate runoff volume and peak rates of
discharge. The SCS uses three (3) standard rainfall distributions, types I, IA,
and II. Type II distribution applies to all areas of the United States except
for parts of the Pacific coast states (California, Oregon, and Washington). The
type II distribution shall apply to the state of Idaho. The amount of runoff
from a given watershed is solved using the following equations:
 S  = 1,000 - 10
       CN
     
 Q  = (P - 0.252)
       (P + 0.8S)
Where:
     
 S  = Potential abstraction in inches.
 P  = Total storm rainfall in inches.
 CN = Runoff curve number.
 Q  = Actual direct runoff in inches.
 
      2.   Runoff Curve Numbers: CN represents and indicates the runoff
potential of a watershed. A higher CN results in a higher runoff potential. The
factors affecting the CN, called the soil cover complex are a combination of
the hydrologic soil group, the land use and treatment class (ground cover).
      3.   Hydrologic Soil Groups: The hydrologic soil groups describe a soil's
potential to produce runoff from a precipitation event. Soils not protected by
vegetation are placed in one of four (4) groups on the basis of the intake of
water after the soils have been wetted and have received precipitation from
long duration storms. The four (4) standard hydrologic soil groups 1  are:
         a.   Group A soils, having a high infiltration rate when thoroughly
wet. These consist chiefly of deep, well drained to excessively drained, sands
or gravels. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.
         b.   Group B soils, having a moderate infiltration rate when
thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately
well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to
moderately course texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water
transmission.
         c.   Group C soils, having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly
wet. These consist chiefly of soils that have a layer that impedes the downward
movement of water or soils that have a moderately fine texture or fine texture.
These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.
         d.   Group D soils, having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff
potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clay soils that have a
high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a permanent high water table,
soils that have a claypan or clay layer near the surface, and soils that are
shallow over a nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of
water transmission.
      4.   Factors For Computing CN: Several factors should be considered when
computing the anticipated future CN for urban areas. The types of structural or
nonstructural methods used within the development for controlling the runoff
will vary the quantity and flow paths of the runoff.
         a.   Consideration should be given to construction methods. Soils
compacted by heavy equipment beyond natural compaction conditions, the extent
of vegetative cover or sod versus barren soil within a pervious area, the
impact of grading on surface and subsurface soils (to the extent that the mixed
soils may create a completely different hydrologic condition) all must be
factored into the CN determination.
         b.   Irrigation in farming communities or heavily watered lawns in
suburban areas may significantly increase the moisture content in the soil
above that which would be expected with natural rainfall conditions.
         c.   Table 6-5 gives CNs for agricultural, suburban, and urban land
use classifications. The suburban and urban CNs are based on typical land use
relationships that exist nationwide. The CNs should only be used when it has
been determined that the area under study meets the criteria for which the CN
was developed.
         d.   There will be areas to which the values in table 6-5 do not
apply. The percentage of impervious area for the various types of residential
areas or the land use condition for the pervious areas may vary from the
conditions assumed in table 6-5. A curve for each pervious CN can be developed
to determine the composite CN for any density of impervious area. Figure 6-
8 was developed assuming a CN of ninety eight (98) for the impervious area. The
curves in the figure can help estimate the increase in runoff as the impervious
area increases for a given development.
         e.   The percentage of impervious to pervious area should be
determined accurately and be representative of the site so the composite CN
will assist the designer in accurately predicting the volume of runoff. The
designer's assumptions and calculations shall be included in the hydraulic
analysis to justify the selection runoff curve number.
      5.   Peak Runoff Rates:
         a.   A quick and reliable method of computing peak runoff rates from
agricultural drainage areas, one to two thousand (2,000) acres in size, is
through the use of the figures developed by the soil conservation service.
These figures were prepared for the solution of the general relationships
described above, are based on type II rainfall distribution and are applicable
to the state of Idaho.
         b.   The figures are only to be used for watersheds within the one to
two thousand (2,000) acre range. They provide a basic peak discharge rate for a
24-hour duration storm associated with the watershed in a natural condition.
Figure 6-9, flat slope is based on a one percent (1%) slope. Figure 6-10,
moderate slope is based on a four percent (4%) slope. Figure 6-11, steep slope
is based on a sixteen percent (16%) slope. For slopes other than one percent
(1%), four percent (4%), sixteen percent (16%), use the factors in table 6-6 to
modify the peak discharge.
         c.   The following equations relate a method of adjusting the peak
runoff rates from the charts to reflect the increase in the runoff due to
urbanization:
            (1)   Modification of peak runoff rates due to urbanization:
 QMOD      = Q (FactorIMP) (FactorHLM)
Where:
 QMOD      = Modified discharge due to urbanization.
 Q         = Discharge rate for future CN from charts.
 FactorIMP = Adjustment factor for percent impervious areas.
 FactorHLM = Adjustment factor for percent of hydraulic length modified.
 
            (2)   Figure 6-12 and 6-13 give the factors IMP and HLM for
adjusting peaks calculated from the charts on the same parameters that affect
watershed lag and time of concentration.
            (3)   The above equation for computing peak discharges is based in
part on the relationship between the hydraulic length and the watershed area
from the U.S. department of agriculture's small experimental watersheds. Figure
6-14 shows the best fit line relating length to drainage area. The equation of
the line is 1 = 209a0.6. A watershed shape factor, l/w, is then fixed for any
given drainage area. For example, for drainage areas of ten (10), one hundred
(100), and one thousand (1,000) acres the watershed shape factor is 1.58, 2.51,
and 3.98, respectively.
         d.   There are watersheds that deviate considerably from these
relationships. The peaks can be modified for other shape factors using the
following procedure:
            (1)   Determine the amount of runoff in inches for the watershed.
            (2)   Determine the hydraulic length of watershed and compute an
"equivalent drainage area" using figure 6-14.
            (3)   Using the "equivalent drainage area" determine the rate of
runoff from figure 6-9, 6-10, or 6-11 in cubic feet per second per inch.
            (4)   Using the equivalent area, obtain the slope adjustment factor
from table 6-8 and multiply by the rate of runoff obtained in subsection C5d(3)
of this section to obtain the equivalent peak discharge.
            (5)   Multiply the result from subsection C5d(4) of this section by
the actual area of the drainage basin divided by the equivalent area obtained
in subsection C5d(2) of this section.
            (6)   Compute the "actual peal discharge" for the watershed by
multiplying the result in subsection C5d(5) of this section by the amount of
runoff in subsection C5d(1) of this section.
      6.   Tabular Method Of Determining Peak Runoff:
         a.   An alternate method for determining the peak runoff rate is the
tabular method. This method computes peak discharges from urban areas using
time of concentration (Tc) and travel time (Tt). This method approximates the
more detailed hydrograph analysis, SCS, Tr-20 "Computer Program For Project
Formulation - Hydrology" developed by the engineering division of the soil
conservation service.
         b.   The tabular method can be used to develop composite hydrographs
at any point within a watershed by dividing the watershed into subareas and
computing the time of concentration for each subarea and the travel time
through each reach. The above factors also apply to the tabular method: twenty
four (24) hour rainfall amount, a given rainfall distribution, hydrologic soil-
cover complexes (CNs), time of concentration, travel time, and drainage area.
         c.   The tabular method is most effective when applied to watersheds
where hydrographs are needed to measure nonhomogeneous runoff; i.e., the
watershed is divided into subareas. It is especially useful in developed
watersheds and can be used to determine the effects of structures, combinations
of structures, and channel modifications at different locations within the
watershed.
         d.   Table 6-7 shows the tabular discharge values for the type II
rainfall distribution used in this procedure. Tabular discharges, in terms of
cubic feet per second per square mile (csm) per inch of runoff, are given for a
range of Tc from 0.1 to two (2) hours, and Tt from zero to four (4) hours. The
table was developed by computing hydrographs for one square mile of drainage
area for a range of time of concentration, routing them through stream reaches
with a range of travel times. A constant runoff curve number of seventy five
(75) and a rainfall volume sufficient to yield three inches (3") of runoff were
used.
         e.   The tabular method should not be used when large changes in the
runoff curve number occur among subareas within a watershed and when runoff
volumes are less than about 1.5 inches for curve numbers less than sixty (60).
For most watershed conditions, this procedure is adequate to determine the
effects of urbanization on peak rates of discharge for subareas up to
approximately twenty (20) square miles in size.
         f.   The computed values of time of concentration and travel time can
be rounded to the nearest value in table 6-7 or, if more refinement is
warranted, the discharges can be computed using the calculated time of
concentration and travel time through interpolation between the Tc and Tt shown
in the table. The information needed to calculate the peak discharge at a point
in the watershed is:
            (1)   The drainage area of each subarea.
            (2)   Tc for each subarea.
            (3)   Tt for each routing reach.
            (4)   The runoff curve number for each subarea.
         (5)   The twenty four (24) hour rainfall for a selected frequency.
         (6)   The runoff in inches for each subarea.

the soil conservation service, USDA, January 1975.

12-1-4: PURPOSES:
   A.   Land proposed for subdivision must be suitable and safe for building
without danger from flood, or other natural or manmade hazard. It is intended
that these regulations shall complement and implement provisions and standards
contained in Building Codes, land use regulations, the comprehensive plan and
any relevant capital improvement plans of Kellogg.

all parts of the City and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development
of the community's lands.
      4.   To guide public and private policy in order to provide adequate and
efficient streets, water, sewerage, drainage, parks, and other public
facilities.
      5.   To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for
subdivisions in order to further the orderly layout and use of land, and to
ensure proper legal description and monumentation of subdivided land.
      6.   To ensure that public facilities and services are available
concurrent with development and will have sufficient capacity to serve the
subdivision.
      7.   To ensure that the community will bear no more than its fair share
of any cost of providing services by requiring the developer to pay fees,
furnish land, or establish mitigation measures to provide a fair share of
capital facilities needs generated by the development.
      8.   To assure the adequacy of drainage facilities to safeguard the water
table, and to encourage the wise use and management of natural resources to
preserve the stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land.
      9.   To promote the health and safety of the community, Kellogg supports
the Institutional Controls Program which is designed to protect the public
residing and working within the Bunker Hill Superfund Site. The Institutional
Controls Program (ICP) is administered by Idaho Panhandle Health District in
accordance with Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 41.01.01, 500
through 543. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-5: ENACTMENT:
In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with these purposes and
policies, this title is hereby adopted and shall become effective upon its
passage and publication according to law. All applications for subdivision
approval, including final approval, pending on the effective date of these
regulations shall be reviewed pursuant to the ordinances in effect at the time

review, processing and inspection of subdivisions. Such fees shall be
reasonably related to the costs of services provided by the City with respect
to the subdivision of land.
   B.   The City may, as a condition of approval of a subdivision, require
mitigation of the effects of development on the ability of the City, and other
political subdivisions, to deliver services without compromising quality or
imposing substantial additional costs to current residents. Such conditions may
not exceed the actual impact of the development unless the developer agrees to
such conditions. In lieu of such mitigation or as a complement thereto, the
developer may pay fees which will be used by the City to mitigate such impacts.
(Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-8: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   It shall be the authority of the planning and building official and/or
the Public Works Supervisor or his/her designees to enforce the provisions of
this title.
   B.   No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building
or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation of the
provisions of these regulations, nor shall the City have any obligation to
issue certificates of occupancy or to extend utility services to any parcel
created or established in violation of these provisions.
   C.   Violations of the provisions of this title may be deemed an infraction,
or a misdemeanor crime, punishable as provided in this Code, with each day such
violation continues constituting a separate offense. The City shall have
recourse to such civil remedies in law and equity as may be necessary to ensure
compliance with the provisions of these regulations. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-9: INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT, AND SEVERABILITY:
   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title
shall be held to be the minimum requirements. More stringent provisions may be
required if it is demonstrated that such standards are necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or
annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or other provision of law
except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or
other provision of law, the provision which is more restrictive or imposes the
standards most likely to protect the public health, safety and general welfare
shall control.
   C.   These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, private
covenant or any other private agreement or restriction, provided that where the
provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards
or regulation, the requirements of these regulations shall govern irrespective
of private contractual provision.
   D.   The provisions of this title are severable. If any section, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this title is adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the decision shall not affect the remaining
portions of this title. The remainder shall be interpreted to further the
purposes of this title.
   E.   The provisions of this title serve to supersede prior ordinances
regulating subdivision of land in Kellogg. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-10: SAVING PROVISION:
The adoption of these regulations shall not abate any action now pending under
prior subdivision regulations or abate, modify, or alter any penalty accruing
or about to accrue. These regulations shall not waive any right of the City
under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption, or vacate or
annul any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful action
of the City except as expressly provided for herein. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-11: RESERVATIONS AND REPEALS:
Upon the adoption of these regulations according to law, the subdivision
ordinance of Kellogg (ordinance 413), adopted May 8, 1996 as amended, is hereby
repealed, except as provided above. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-1-12: EXCEPTIONS AND WAIVERS OF CONDITIONS:
   A.   When there may be alternatives or different solutions proposed for a
subdivision, other than strict compliance with these regulations and/or the
purposes of these regulations, the City Council may approve exceptions and/or
waiver of conditions to these regulations. The granting of an exception or
waiver of conditions shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of these regulations. The City Council shall not permit exceptions and/
or waiver of conditions unless it finds, based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case, that:
      1.   The granting of the exception, or waiver of conditions will not be
detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other
property.
      2.   The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property.
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular and
unnecessary hardship to the owner would result if the strict application of
these regulations is applied.
      4.   The change sought will not vary the provisions of this Code, except
that those documents may be amended in the manner prescribed by law.
   B.   In approving exceptions or waivers of conditions, the City Council may
require conditions that will secure the purposes of this title. An exception is
any alternative design, or proposed change in subdivision ordinance
requirements that is requested by the developer. The exception requested must
be reviewed as an integral part of the overall review process as outlined in
this title. A request for an exception shall be submitted in writing by the
developer at the time that the subdivision application is filed and shall be
reviewed along with the subdivision. The request shall specify which ordinance
provisions shall be subject to exception along with the proposed changes and
the reasons why the changes are necessary. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall make a recommendation to the City Council specific to the exception
requested. The City Council shall render a decision on the requested exception
at the time the subdivision is reviewed.
   C.   A waiver of conditions is a request to change the conditions of
subdivision approval as agreed to in the development agreement. A request for a
waiver of conditions must be in writing and submitted to the Planning
Department prior to acceptance by the City of construction improvements or
recordation of the final plat. The request shall specify the condition needing
to be waived and the reasons the waiver would be justified. Upon receipt of a
request, the Administrator will place the request on the agenda of the Planning
and Zoning Commission for hearing. Notice of hearing shall be provided in the
same manner as hearing for subdivision approval. The request will be reviewed
and the commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council. The Council
shall review the recommendation and shall render a decision on the waiver of
conditions. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)

12-3-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedures for review and
action on applications for subdivisions. The procedure is intended to provide
orderly and expeditious processing of subdivision applications. (Ord. 596, 6-
13-2018)
12-3-2: PRE-APPLICATION:
Prior to submittal of a subdivision application, the developer shall have
completed a pre- application conference to review the proposal. The pre-
application conference may be waived by the Administrator if the proposal is a
minor subdivision.
   A.   A developer seeking a pre-application conference shall submit three (3)
copies of a concept plan to the Administrator. The Administrator shall schedule
and hold the pre-application conference within thirty (30) days from the
submittal date unless additional time is agreed to by the developer. However,
the Administrator is encouraged to expedite this process for uncomplicated
projects.
   B.   A pre-application conference allows the developer an opportunity to
meet with Municipal staff and other representatives deemed appropriate by the
Administrator. A representative of the Public Works Department shall be invited
to all pre-application conferences. The City Engineer may be invited as
determined by the Administrator. Elected officials and Planning and Zoning
Commission members shall not be a part of this process. Items to be reviewed
include, but are not limited to:
      1.   The general subdivision process.
      2.   Overall design, lot sizes, and street layout.
      3.   Preliminary utility design.
      4.   Potential off site impacts/mitigation.
      5.   Off site/on site improvements.
   C.   Additional pre-application review may be scheduled by the Administrator
when, in the collective judgment of staff, the proposed subdivision is
extraordinarily complex, proposes large impacts to City utility systems, or
requires extraordinary staff time. Total time for pre-application review shall
not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of submittal unless additional time is
agreed to by the developer.
   D.   At the conclusion of the pre-application review process the
Administrator shall provide the developer with a written notice to proceed,
which includes a statement of issues, concerns and recommendations deemed
important by the City staff based upon the level of information available at
the time of pre-application review. Notice to proceed allows the developer to
submit an application for subdivision review. A notice to proceed states that
the proposed subdivision has been reviewed by appropriate staff and agencies
and is eligible to submit an application and does not constitute an approval in
any way. Such notice may include comments, concerns, and recommendations of the
staff and participating agencies.

12-3-5: MINOR SUBDIVISION REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
   A.   The purpose of minor subdivision review is to provide a simplified
procedure for processing minor subdivisions administratively. Minor
subdivisions are subdivisions of four (4) or fewer lots that create no new
streets. The process is intended for the creation of lots along existing
streets where infrastructure is available. A minor subdivision may be part of a
planned unit development. A developer proposing to create additional lots on
the same original parcel within a single five (5) year period (multiple minor
subdivisions from 1 parcel) as a minor subdivision may be required by the
Administrator to use the full subdivision review process if the Administrator
determines that the multiple minor subdivisions may have a significant impact
on public facilities to be used by the development.
   B.   Upon receipt of a complete application, the Administrator shall
schedule a minor subdivision review with appropriate staff and the developer. A
date for the review will be established within seven (7) days from the date of
application acceptance.
   C.   The Administrator shall provide copies of submitted documents, as
necessary, to outside agencies and jurisdictions which, in the opinion of the
Administrator, may be affected by the proposal. In addition, the Administrator
shall provide written notice to the owners of property adjacent to the property
proposed for development. The notice shall provide the adjacent property owners
a plan of the minor subdivision, general information concerning the proposal,
and the time frame for submitting written comments. The period of time for
comment or response shall not be less than fourteen (14) days of transmittal.
   D.   The Administrator shall conduct a minor subdivision review, along with
appropriate staff, to ensure that all applicable ordinance provisions are
followed or completed. Minor subdivision review shall include, but not be
limited to:
      1.   Review of lot sizes and dimensions for conformance to the zoning
ordinance.
      2.   Determination that there are adequate provisions to serve the minor
subdivision with sewer and water.
      3.   Defining the scope of improvements and dedications required (curb,
sidewalk, paving, water, sewer, drainage, easements, right-of-way dedication,
streetlights, etc.) by City standards.
      4.   Evaluation of the location of potential rights-of-way to access
adjoining parcels pursuant to City standards.
   The Administrator shall prepare a report for the City Council stating
whether or not the proposal has met all of the requirements for minor
subdivision and whether or not it should be approved along with statements
supporting the recommendation and any appropriate conditions.
   E.   The City Council shall review the application, submittals and the
Administrator's report and decide the minor subdivision proposal. A decision to
deny shall be in writing and indicate reasons for denial and indicate what
steps are necessary to obtain approval. In the case of approval or approval
with conditions, a memorandum of understanding shall be prepared that details
the conditions of approval and the responsibilities of the developer. The
memorandum of understanding shall be signed by the developer and the Mayor, and
returned to the City within sixty (60) days of release of the document by the
City, prior to proceeding to plat review. Failure to return the signed
memorandum of understanding within sixty (60) days shall constitute an
abandonment of the application and the approval shall be of no force or effect.
   F.   The applicant or any affected party may request reconsideration of the
decision. Reconsideration is a procedure by which an applicant or other
affected person seeks to have a final decision-maker revisit the outcome or
rationale of a quasi-judicial land-use decision. A request for reconsideration
must be initiated within no more than seven (7) days after a final decision is
made and must address a specific error or omission. The determination to
reconsider rests solely in the discretion of the decision-maker. If the
decision-maker agrees to reconsider it shall specify the procedures to be
followed and inform those entitled to notice. If the decision-maker determines
that it will not reconsider, it should state the reasons why and notify those
entitled to notice. The decision not to reconsider shall be deemed a final
decision for purposes and timing of maintaining an appeal. A decision to
reconsider shall toll the time for appeal until a final decision has been
rendered after reconsideration.
   G.   The approval of a minor subdivision shall be effective for a period of
two (2) years from the date the City receives the signed memorandum of
understanding. If a plat is not submitted for approval within the two (2) year
period, the minor subdivision approval shall be null and void, and the
developer shall be required to submit a new application. Prior to the
expiration date of the effective period, the developer may request an
extension, in writing, from the Administrator. The Administrator may grant an
extension, not to exceed twelve (12) months, upon a showing of good cause by
the developer and upon finding that City regulations have not been changed
significantly from those under which the original approval was reviewed. The
Administrator shall decide a request for extension within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of the written request. The developer may appeal the
Administrator's decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   H.   At any time after minor subdivision approval and before submission of a
subdivision plat, the developer may request of the Administrator that an
amendment be made to the minor subdivision plan or to conditions of approval.
If the proposed amendment is a minor change to the plan and consistent with
conditions of approval, the Administrator may grant the amendment in writing
within ten (10) days of the request, unless the Administrator determines that
additional time is necessary for reasons stated in writing. If the amendment is
major or involves a change in the conditions of approval, the Administrator
shall schedule a review with staff, and notify adjoining landowners, at his/her
discretion, to review the proposed amendment. The date for the review shall be
scheduled within twenty one (21) days of the request.
   I.   Upon completion of the review for the amendment request, the
Administrator may grant the amendment if the minor subdivision is not
substantially changed and does, in fact, remain a minor subdivision. If the
proposed amendment changes the plan to cause it to become a subdivision, the
Administrator shall disapprove the amendment and notify the developer to adhere
to the approved plan or to apply for the full subdivision review process. (Ord.
596, 6-13-2018)
12-3-6: SUBDIVISION REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
The purpose of this process is to provide a timely and efficient review of
requests for subdivisions. A "subdivision" is any division of a lot, tract, or
parcel of land into two (2) or more lots and accompanied by proposed new
streets or extensions to existing streets, and/or extensions of Municipal sewer
and water services. A subdivision may be part of a planned unit development
(PUD). Planned unit developments require a public hearing under title 11, "Land
Use Regulations", of this Code, specifically subsection
11-7-2D of this Code.
   A.   The date that a completed application is accepted as complete by the
Administrator shall be the official submission date.
   B.   Upon receipt of a complete application for subdivision approval along
with all of the required submittals, the Administrator shall place the
application for review on the agenda before the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The Planning and Zoning Commission review shall be held at least forty five
(45) days after but within seventy five (75) days of the official submission
date if the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission permits.
   C.   Notice and request for comment shall be mailed to agencies, utilities,
and other jurisdictions deemed appropriate by the Administrator or required by
Idaho Code no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Planning and Zoning
Commission review. The notice and request for comment shall include application
information, notice of the review date, additional staff comments, and a date
by which comments are to be received. A copy of the application and a copy of
the subdivision plan shall be included.
   D.   The Administrator shall prepare a report for the Planning and Zoning
Commission that provides information about the site and the subdivision to aid
the commission in making a recommendation to the City Council. The report
should include, but is not limited to, the following information, whether part
of the application materials or otherwise:
      1.   The current zoning and comprehensive plan policies relevant to the
proposed subdivision.
      2.   Existing land use on the site of the subdivision as well as the
surrounding land use.
      3.   The location, size and adequacy of capacity of existing sewer and
water lines.
      4.   A description of the physical characteristics of the site to include
a basic inventory of vegetation and any unique features.
      5.   A description of existing streets serving the site of the
subdivision and a synopsis of the proposed streets.
      6.   A list of issues that the commission and Council can focus upon.
      7.   An analysis of the impact of the subdivision on the infrastructure
of the community. This shall include deficiencies in existing infrastructure
and what improvements would be needed to bring the infrastructure up to an
acceptable level of service.
      8.   Recommended conditions if the subdivision should be approved.
   E.   After the Planning and Zoning Commission has reviewed the subdivision
plan, preliminary construction plans, staff report, and exhibits submitted at
the review, the commission shall forward a recommendation to the City Council.
The commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or
disapproval of the subdivision within thirty (30) days of the review, unless
circumstances require a longer review period for reasons set forth in a motion
adopted by the commission. The Administrator shall notify the developer, in
writing, within seven (7) days of the action by the commission. Such
notification shall specify any recommended conditions or changes requested and
shall advise the developer that the subdivision will be placed on the agenda of
the City Council only upon the developer's written request.
   F.   The City Council, upon receipt of a staff report and recommendation
from the Planning and Zoning Commission, and after an opportunity to review the
file and minutes of the meeting, shall act upon the request. The City Council
shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the subdivision within
thirty (30) days of the date of the Council meeting at which it is reviewed, or
in such time as it may be determined by motion approved by the City Council.
The Administrator shall notify the developer in writing of the decision of the
City Council and, in the case of approval or approval with conditions, shall
prepare a development agreement for signature by the developer and the City. If
a subdivision application is denied by City Council, a subsequent application
for subdividing the subject property cannot be submitted to the City within one
year of such denial unless a request for application resubmittal is received
and approved by the City Council. Such request shall be submitted to the
Planning and Building Department, with the appropriate fee, and shall provide
the City Council with reasons why the application should be accepted and
processed. The City Council will review the request, determine whether or not
the proposal is significantly different than the one denied and permit an
application to be accepted and processed or deny the request.
   G.   Upon approval by the City Council, subsequent review and approval of
final construction plans by the City Engineer which substantially conform to
the subdivision plans approved by the City Council, and completion of a
development agreement, the developer may proceed with construction of the
subdivision.
   H.   No subdivision shall receive a recommendation of approval from the
Planning and Zoning Commission or be approved by the City Council unless
findings and conclusions are made that:
      1.   Definite provision has been made for a water supply system that is
adequate in terms of quantity, and quality for the type of subdivision
proposed.
      2.   Adequate provisions have been made for a public sewage collection
system and that the existing treatment system can accommodate the proposed
sewer flows.
      3.   Proposed streets are consistent with the transportation element of
the comprehensive plan and any City transportation plans.
      4.   All areas of the proposed subdivision which may involve soil or
topographical conditions presenting hazards have been identified and that the
proposed uses of these areas are compatible with such conditions.
      5.   The area proposed for subdivision is zoned for the proposed use and
the use conforms to other requirements found in this Code.
      6.   The developer has made adequate plans to ensure that the community
will bear no more than its fair share of costs to provide services by paying
fees, furnishing land, or providing other mitigation measures for off site
impacts to streets, parks, and other public facilities within the community.
   I.   The developer shall have construction plans prepared by a civil
engineer, licensed in the State. Such plans shall adhere to the design and
improvement standards set forth in this title as well as the City of Kellogg
public works standards. No construction of any kind shall take place on the
site of an approved subdivision until final construction plans are reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer and Public Works Department, and a development
agreement and a construction improvement agreement are completed and properly
approved by the City. Systems reviewed and subject to staff approval include,
but are not limited to:
      1.   Streets, including curbs and sidewalks.
      2.   Water delivery system and water supply.
      3.   Sanitary sewer system.
      4.   Stormwater collection and treatment plans, including stormwater
management during construction.
      5.   Streetlight plans.
      6.   Off site improvements (streets, traffic signals, sidewalks,
lighting, etc.).
   J.   Time limits contained within this title are directory. Violation of
time limits established in this title shall not be the basis for damages and
shall have no effect on the approval or disapproval of a subdivision. Time
limits provided herein may be extended for good cause. The City Council
President and Mayor shall be informed of any failure of staff to meet time
limits, and shall take appropriate action to ensure that limits are conformed
to when circumstances allow. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-3-7: ZONING AND SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS, APPROVAL DURATION:
   A.   Every subdivision shall conform to zoning and subdivision regulations
applicable at the official submission date.
   B.   The approval of a subdivision shall be effective for a period of three
(3) years from the date that the master development agreement is recorded
unless a different time period is requested by the developer, in writing at the
time of application, and agreed to by the City Council in a development
agreement. The master development agreement shall be signed and returned to the
City within sixty (60) days of release of the document by the City. By the end
of the agreed upon time period, the developer must have submitted a plat for
review and approval. If a plat is not submitted for final approval within the
three (3) year period or agreed upon time period, the subdivision approval may
be deemed null and void by City Council, and the developer may be required to
submit a new application.
   C.   Prior to the expiration date of the effective period, the developer may
request an extension, in writing, from the Administrator. The Administrator may
grant an extension, not to exceed twelve (12) months, upon a showing of good
cause by the developer and upon finding that City regulations have not been
changed significantly from those under which the original approval was
reviewed. The Administrator shall render a decision to grant or not grant an
extension within thirty (30) days of the date of submittal to the
Administrator. The developer may appeal the decision of the Administrator to
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   D.   At any time after subdivision approval and before submission of a
subdivision plat, the developer may request of the Administrator, in writing,
that an amendment be made to the subdivision plan or to conditions of approval.
If the proposed amendment is a minor change to the plan, the Administrator may
grant the amendment in writing. If the amendment is major or involves a
substantial change in the conditions of approval, the Administrator shall
submit the request to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a decision. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the request for the proposed
amendment in accordance with the same requirements for subdivision approval.
   E.   A review of a proposed major amendment shall be limited to whether the
proposed amendment should or should not be approved. The commission may
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove any proposed major amendment
and may make any modifications in the terms and conditions of subdivision
approval reasonably related to the proposed amendment. The commission shall
render a decision on the proposed amendment within thirty (30) days from the
date of the review or in such time as it may determine by motion approved by
the commission. Any proposed changes to conditions shall be forwarded to the
City Council for review as would be the case for a new subdivision proposal.
Any changes approved by the City Council shall be included in the development
agreement or an addendum to the development agreement for the project. (Ord.
596, 6-13-2018)
12-3-8: PHASING OR SECTIONALIZING SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Large developments may be phased or sectionalized, to be developed in
portions periodically according to a proposed schedule. The developer shall
indicate plans for phasing or sectionalizing at the time of application. The
plans, subject to review and approval, shall show proposed phasing boundaries.
Proposed interim or temporary solutions to sanitary sewer and water systems and
to the handling of traffic on local streets, collectors, and arterials within
the subdivision, shall be shown on plans submitted along with a narrative
description of assurance of completion of permanent system improvements.
   B.   The development agreement for each subdivision must ensure that the
dedication of public streets and improvements will occur according to the
phasing plans, subject to conditions imposed by the City Council during
subdivision review. The Council may, in the interest of public safety and
welfare, require that certain collector streets and arterials be dedicated and
constructed in their entirety regardless of the phasing plan.
   C.   In approving a subdivision to be developed in phases, the City Council
may require that the development agreement indicate the phasing plans and that
the amounts calculated for guarantees are commensurate with the phasing plan.
The Council may require that the guarantee amount be that amount calculated for
each phase and may defer the remaining amounts of the guarantee until the
remaining sections of the subdivision are platted.
   D.   A phasing plan shall coordinate required infrastructure systems,
dedications, off site improvements, open space/parks, landscaping, private
utilities, or other elements of a subdivision. The plan may indicate times or
triggering mechanisms for improvements. Agreements between the developer and
the City concerning the acceleration or deceleration of development of the
subdivision may be included in the development agreement. Provisions of a
development agreement shall endeavor to the greatest extent possible to tie
together the contingencies of development of a phased project. (Ord. 596, 6-13-

2018)
12-4-3: REVIEW:
   A.   Upon submittal of the plat to the Administrator, a staff review will be
completed within twenty eight (28) days of acceptance. The review will
determine whether all conditions of the approved development agreement have
been completed and whether the plat is consistent with the approved
subdivision. Such review shall determine that:
      1.   The plat is in conformance with Idaho Code 50-1301 et seq., Plats
and Vacations.
      2.   The plat layout is as approved by the City Council during
subdivision review or as approved by the Administrator during minor subdivision
review.
      3.   A development agreement has been completed.
      4.   Language on the dedication section of the plat reflects what was
agreed to in the development agreement and that any dedications are accurately
described.
      5.   The appropriate signature blocks are on the plat and that all
signatures have been obtained except for the signatures of the City Engineer,
Mayor, City Clerk, and County Recorder.
      6.   Construction plans have been reviewed and approved.
      7.   All required on site and off site improvements have been constructed
and accepted by the Public Works Department, or have been suitably guaranteed.
      8.   Any mitigation required or determined in a development agreement,
has been satisfied or other suitable arrangements approved by the City Council
have been made. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-4-4: APPROVAL:
When staff and City Engineer review of the plat is completed and all required
terms and conditions are satisfied, staff may forward the plat to the City
Clerk recommending that it be submitted to the City Council for approval. The
City Clerk shall place the request for plat approval on the next available City
Council agenda. The Council shall review the subdivision and plat and, upon a
finding that all of the requirements have been satisfied, shall authorize the
Mayor and the City Clerk to sign. The City Engineer's signature shall be the
final approval assigned to the plat. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-4-5: RECORDATION:
After the plat is signed by the Mayor, City Clerk and City Engineer, the
developer shall record the plat with the County Recorder, and provide the
Administrator with a reproducible Mylar copy of the recorded plat. Upon
recordation of the plat and receipt of a reproducible Mylar of the recorded
plat, building permits may be issued for the lots created. (Ord. 596, 6-13-

longer valid. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-5-9: AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT:
Should amendments to the agreement be necessary and if all parties are in
agreement, an addendum to the agreement shall be negotiated subject to review
by the City Attorney for signature of the parties. Either party may propose
amending the agreement by notifying other parties to the agreement in writing
of the nature of the amendment and the reasons why the amendment is necessary.
The party requesting the amendment shall be responsible for any costs
associated with the preparation of the addendum to the development agreement,
unless the parties agree to share the costs. Such cost sharing arrangement
shall be determined and agreed to, by the parties, prior to negotiating the

shall be provided and streets shall be constructed to provide for street
centerline plus ten feet (10') on the opposite side of the centerline. Along
collectors and arterials that are not fully developed, rights-of-way shall be
provided and streets shall be constructed to provide for street centerline plus
ten feet (10') on the opposite side of centerline.
      4.   Stub streets will be required where a subdivision is located
adjacent to undeveloped property and street connections would provide for
transportation continuity between the properties.
      5.   Streets shall be arranged and located in relationship to existing or
planned topography to result in usable lots, safe streets, and acceptable
gradients.
      6.   Traffic calming measures may be incorporated into design of local
streets, and some minor collectors where approved by the City Engineer.
Acceptable calming measures include roundabouts, traffic circles, landscaping,
curb extensions, mid block medians, and other acceptable measures.
      7.   To facilitate vehicle and pedestrian movements, enhance emergency
service, and reduce City maintenance, the use of cul-de-sacs should be limited
to portions of developments in which street continuity is not foreseeable due
to property configurations.
      8.   Private streets may be approved as a part of a PUD or subdivision,
or by the City Council, if: a) the proposed street(s) are not required to
provide continuity or add circulation to the overall City transportation
system, and b) emergency service is not compromised. Private streets and
associated streetlights shall meet City public street and illumination
standards.

2018)
12-7-9: STREET TREES:
   A.   Street Trees Required: Street trees are required within the rights-of-
way along both sides of all streets, in accordance with an approved street tree
plan. Trees may be massed, spaced evenly along the street, or both. Within an
area between the edge of pavement and fifty feet (50') from the centerline of
the street, there is for every forty feet (40') of street frontage an average
of one deciduous tree that is suitable for street tree planting. Suitability of
trees for planting along rights-of-way shall be determined by ultimate size,
lack of interference with utilities and sidewalks, appropriate planting zone,
and common nursery standards.
   B.   Street Tree Plan: A street tree plan, prepared by a landscape architect
licensed in the State of Idaho, shall be submitted for review and approval
prior to commencement of any subdivision construction. The plan shall identify
type, size and location of trees and planting and construction details. Where
existing trees are to be retained, the plan should indicate proposed methods of
protection during construction.
   C.   Tree Locations: Tree locations shall not interfere with utilities,
sidewalks, intersection and drive approach visibility, or streetlights. Plans
may be altered to accommodate driveways or other elements upon review and
approval by the City.
   D.   Planting: The method and timing of tree planting shall be indicated
with the subdivision application, reviewed and approved, and placed in the
development agreement.
   E.   Irrigation And Maintenance: Street trees shall be irrigated and
maintained by the adjacent property owner, a homeowners' association, a
combination thereof, or as determined during subdivision review and placed into
the development agreement. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-7-10: RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION DESIGN:
   A.   Residential Lot Access: Residential lots shall not front upon or
directly access streets with a classification of minor collector or higher.
Exceptions may be requested and granted in the approval process to accommodate
existing uses. If driveway access locations are indicated within the
subdivision plans, they shall comply with driveways and curb cut standards in
this Code.
   B.   Residential Lot Frontage: All residential lots shall abut a publicly
dedicated street, or an approved private street. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)
12-7-11: COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISION DESIGN:
   A.   Limited Access To Arterial And Collector Streets: Access points shall
be shown on the subdivision plan and become part of the recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the decision of the City Council.
   B.   Commercial; Industrial Lots: Lots within a commercial/industrial
subdivision are not required to front on a public street but must have access
provided through an easement or other arrangement. Review and approval of
commercial/industrial subdivisions should consider the types of uses envisioned
and shall focus on infrastructure provisions, circulation design, potential
traffic impacts and mitigation, access provisions, and any other issues
identified by staff at the pre-application review that pertain to the proposed
subdivision.
   C.   Commercial; Industrial Standards: The applicant shall show that the
streets and block patterns proposed are suitable for the uses anticipated, and
considers other potential or existing uses in the vicinity. Residential uses
adjacent to commercial/industrial subdivisions shall be protected from
potential nuisances (noise, odor, light, etc.) through the use of buffers,
landscaping, setbacks, or open space. (Ord. 596, 6-13-2018)

CHAPTER 1
FLOOD HAZARD PREVENTION REGULATIONS
SECTION:
13-1-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose, And Objectives
13-1-2: Definitions
13-1-3: General Provisions
13-1-4: Administration
13-1-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
13-1-6: Variance And Appeal Procedures
13-1-7: Penalties For Violation
13-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho
Code 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local government units to adopt a
floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies floodplains
and that sets forth minimum development requirements in floodplains that are
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
   B.   Findings Of Fact: The flood hazard areas of the city of Kellogg are
subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
      1.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      2.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adoption and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper
floodplain management.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters.
   D.   Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to:
      1.   Protect human life, health and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions. (Ord. 560, 10-17-2012)
13-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common
usage.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure on the same lot or parcel as a principal
structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
structure. An insurable building should not be classified as an accessory or
appurtenant structure.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet (3'),
and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be
evident.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Zone designations on FIRMs include the letters A, AE, V. Also known as the
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded each year. Also known as the "regulatory flood".
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The water surface elevation during the base flood
in relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation (BFE) is depicted on
the FIRM to the nearest foot and in the FIS to the nearest 0.1 foot.
BASEMENT: The portion of a structure including crawl space with its floor
subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: The value of improvements, requiring a
permit, are cumulated over a five (5) year period and will count collectively
toward the improvement threshold of forty nine percent (49%) of the building's
preimprovement market value.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
has been the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical
datum currently adopted by the federal government as a basis for measuring
heights is the North American vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).

including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures, or the construction of additions or substantial
improvements to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of
mobile homes; mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of materials;
specifically including the construction of dikes, berms and levees. The term
"development" does not include the operation, cleaning, maintenance or repair
of any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or
drainage works that is performed or authorized by the owner thereof pursuant to
lawful rights and obligations.
DIGITAL FIRM (DFIRM): Digital flood insurance rate map. It depicts flood risk

boundaries and water surface elevations of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that corresponds to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance annual flood (base flood), plus any
increase in flood elevation due to floodway encroachment, elevated above BFE.
Therefore the flood protection elevation for Kellogg is equal to BFE plus
allowed floodway elevation.
FLOODPLAIN 1 : The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the
regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge
and store the floodwater or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY: A facility that cannot be used for its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The
term does not include long term storage, manufacture, sales, or service
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for HAG related to
building elevation information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:

listing maintained by the U.S. department of interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register.
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify

programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
   A.   Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. An LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   B.   Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
showing, usually due to manmade changes, changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination that a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is excluded from
the special flood hazard area.
   C.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum national
flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway
maps, or flood insurance studies.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for LAG related
to building elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a
structure's lowest floor. The lowest floor is a determinant for the flood
insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: For the purposes of this chapter, a structure, transportable
in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used
with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle".
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a
community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed on or after September 26, 2008.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis,
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost where the
construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damages
occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds forty nine
percent (49%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The market value of the structure should be: a) the appraised value of the
structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or b) in the
case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This
term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not include
either:
   A.   A project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the governing body from a requirement of this
chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 560, 10-
17-2012)

17-2012)
13-1-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of Floodplain Ordinance Administrator: The planning
administrator is hereby appointed as the floodplain administrator who is
responsible for administering and implementing the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Permit Procedures: Application for a floodplain development permit
shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by the
administrator or the administrator's designee prior to starting development
activities. Specifically, the following information is required:
      1.   Application Stage:
         a.   Plans in duplicate drawn to scale with elevations of the project
area and the nature, location, dimensions of existing and proposed structures,
earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment and drainage
facilities;
         b.   Elevation in relation to the flood protection elevation, or
highest adjacent grade, of the lowest floor level, including crawl spaces or
basement, of all proposed structures;
         c.   Elevation to which any nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed;
         d.   Design certification from a registered professional engineer or
architect that any proposed nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in subsection
13-1-5G2 of this chapter; and
         e.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development.
      2.   Construction Stage:
         a.   For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the floodplain administrator an as built certification
of the floor elevation or floodproofing level, using appropriate FEMA elevation
or floodproofing certificate, immediately after the lowest floor or
floodproofing is completed. When floodproofing is utilized for nonresidential
structures, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. A
finished construction elevation certificate shall be provided to the
administrator prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy.
         b.   Certificate deficiencies identified by the floodplain
administrator shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to
work proceeding. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the
corrections shall be cause for the floodplain administrator to issue a stop
work order for the project.
      3.   Technical Review:
         a.   If the community does not have the expertise to evaluate the
technical data that is part of the application, the community may contract for
an independent engineering review or require a review by FEMA through the
letter of map revision process. The applicant will pay the costs of an
independent technical review.
      4.   Expiration Of Floodplain Development Permit:
         a.   All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within one hundred eighty (180) days. A floodplain
development permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
unless the permitted activity has been substantially begun and thereafter is
pursued to completion.
   C.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Administrator: Duties of the
floodplain administrator shall include, but shall not be limited to:
      1.   Review all floodplain development permit applications to assure that
the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review proposed development to assure that necessary permits have
been received from governmental agencies from which approval is required by
federal or state law, including section 404 of the federal water pollution
control act amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334; the endangered species act of
1973, 16 USC 1531-1544; and state of Idaho stream channel alteration permits,
Idaho Code title 42, chapter 38 require that copies of such permits be provided
and maintained on file.
      3.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data are not available,
then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or
other source in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
      4.   When base flood elevations or other current engineering data are not
available, the floodplain administrator shall take into account the flood
hazards, to the extent they are known, to determine whether a proposed building
site will be reasonably safe from flooding.
      5.   Obtain, and record the actual elevation in relation to the vertical
datum on the effective FIRM, or highest adjacent grade, of the lowest floor
level, including basement, of all new construction or substantially improved
structures.
      6.   Obtain, and record the actual elevation, in relation to the vertical
datum on the effective FIRM to which any new or substantially improved
structures have been floodproofed.
      7.   When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the floodplain
administrator shall obtain certification of design criteria from a registered
professional engineer or architect.
      8.   Where interpretation is needed of the exact location of boundaries
of the areas of special flood hazard including regulatory floodway (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the
interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
chapter.
      9.   All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be
maintained in the office of the city/county clerk or his/her designee and shall
be open for public inspection.
      10.   Maintaining permit records by parcel number or address so that the
history of improvements or repairs, requiring a permit, is checked before a
permit is issued. This is done to monitor and track cumulative substantial
improvement. The construction value of permits for reconstruction and repairs
to damaged building and improvements, modifications, and additions to existing
building are counted cumulative for a period of five (5) years. This will
determine whether or not the total value of permits exceeds forty nine percent
(49%) of the preconstruction market value of the building at the time of the
first permit after adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 560, 10-17-2012)
13-1-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   Subdivision Standards:
      1.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      2.   All subdivision preliminary plats/development plans shall include

constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      4.   All new construction or substantial improvements of an existing
structure, including a structure that has been substantially damaged, that
includes a fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by the
foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed to be an unfinished or
flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry
and exit of floodwater. Designs for complying with this requirement must be

         a.   Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction
or substantial improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, constructed at or above the
community's flood protection elevation. If solid foundation perimeter walls are
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction
standards in subsection B4 of this section.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction:
         a.   New construction or the substantial improvement of any
nonresidential structure located in zones A1-30, AE, or AH must be floodproofed
if the new construction or improvement is not elevated. The structure and
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to
the flood protection elevation or to one foot (1') above the base flood
elevation, whichever is higher, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A licensed
professional engineer or architect must certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
these provisions, and shall provide certification to the administrator.
      3.   Floodway Has Not Been Determined: Where the floodway has not been
determined, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted in zones A1-30 and AE on the effective
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot (1') at any point within the community. Applicants of proposed projects
that increase the base flood elevation more than one foot (1') are required to
obtain and submit to the floodplain administrator, a conditional letter of map
revision (CLOMR) preconstruction.
      4.   Changes To Flood Hazard Map: Postconstruction, the applicant must
apply to FEMA for a letter of map revision for changes to the flood hazard map
proposed in the CLOMR.
      5.   Drainage Paths: In AH zones, drainage paths shall be provided to
guide floodwater around and away from proposed and existing structures.
   H.   Standards For Zones Without Base Flood Elevations And/Or Floodway (A
Zones): These standards apply in special flood hazard areas where streams exist
but no base flood elevation data have been provided (A zones), or where base
flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated.
      1.   When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified
by FEMA in a flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, then the
floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. If data
are not available from any source, only then subsections H2 and H3 of this
section shall apply.
         a.   Where the floodplain administrator has obtained base flood
elevation data, applicants of proposed projects that increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot (1') shall obtain a conditional letter of map
revision preconstruction and a letter of map revision postconstruction.
      2.   No encroachments, including structures or fill, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or fifty feet (50'), whichever
is greater, measured from the ordinary high water mark, unless certification by
a licensed professional engineer documents that the encroachment will not
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood.
      3.   In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new
construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawl space)
elevated no less than two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
subsections B and C of this section.
   I.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Shallow flooding
areas designated AO zones, are areas of special flood hazard that have base
flood depths of one to three feet (3'), with no clearly defined channel. The
following provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the adjacent grade at least as high as the flood depth number
specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). If no flood depth
number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at
least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the construction standards in subsection B4 of this section.
      2.   New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential
structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure and attendant
utility and sanitary facilities must be designed to be watertight to the
specified base flood level or at least two feet (2') above highest adjacent
grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these
provisions, and shall provide certification to the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away
from all proposed and existing structures.
   J.   Alteration Of A Watercourse: A watercourse is considered altered when
any change occurs within its banks.
      1.   The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development and submit certification by a registered professional
engineer that the bank full flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not
be diminished.
      2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. army corps of engineers and the Idaho
department of water resources stream channel alteration program must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
notification must be submitted to the floodplain administrator and to the
federal emergency management agency.
      3.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      4.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in subsections K1 and K2 of this section when an alteration of a watercourse
results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area,
including the placement of culverts.
   K.   Requirement To Submit New Technical Data:
      1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area in accordance with subsection A3 of this section;
         c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts;
         d.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
establishment of base flood elevations according to subsection A3 of this
section.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or
letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for
these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. 560,
10-17-2012)
13-1-6: VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Variance:
      1.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the city clerk on
the form provided by the city of Kellogg and include, at a minimum, the same
information required for a development permit and an explanation for the basis
for the variance request.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the variance
request will be set for public hearing at the next planning commission meeting
in which time is available for the matter to be heard.
      3.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be published
in the official newspaper of the city of Kellogg at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice
shall be provided to all adjoining property owners.
      4.   The burden to show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   B.   Criteria For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances may be issued upon:
         a.   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances.
      5.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
   C.   Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance
shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and
denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice
along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its
lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
   D.   Appeals: The city council shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the administrator.
      1.   An appeal must be filed with the city clerk within fourteen (14)
days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the administrator.
Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure to exhaust the
administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the interpretation of the
administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts relied upon by the
appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in the interpretation.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled for
the next available city council meeting to be heard. The city council shall
consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, including:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
            (11)   The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   E.   Decision: The city council decision on appeal shall be in writing and
set out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
(Ord. 560, 10-17-2012)
13-1-7: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered
unless in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking
such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

CHAPTER 5
CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEE
SECTION:
14-5-1:      Calculation Of Impact Fee
14-5-1: CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEE:
A.   The City shall calculate the amount of the impact fee due for each
building permit, site development permit, and manufactured/mobile home
installation permit by the procedure set forth in the "Report" within thirty
(30) days of submittal of complete permit plans for residential development and
within sixty (60) days of submittal of complete permit plans for commercial
development.
B.   The calculation of a development impact fee shall be in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A development impact fee shall not be
deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in an incidental benefit
to owners or developers within the service area other than the person paying
the fee.
C.   A development impact fee shall be calculated on the basis of levels of
service for public facilities adopted in this article and in the "Report" that
are applicable to existing development as well as new growth and development.
The construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing
public facilities for which a development impact fee is imposed must be
attributable to the capacity demands generated by the new development.
D.   If the development for which a building permit, site development permit,
or manufactured/mobile home installation permit, is sought contains a mix of
uses, the impact fee will be calculated for each type of development.
E.   Prior to making an application for a building permit, site development
permit, manufactured/mobile home installation permit, a prospective applicant
may request in writing a written certification of the development impact fee
schedule or individual assessment for a particular project which shall
establish the development fee for a period of one (1) year from the date of
certification. The certification shall include an expansion of facilities
considered under Section 67-8207, Idaho Code. The certification shall specify
the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used.
F.   Individual assessment of impact fees is permitted in situations where the
fee payer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the established
impact fee is inappropriate.
   1.   Individual assessments of development impact fees may be made by
application to the Building Official, or his or her duly designated agent,
prior to receiving building permits, site development permits, manufactured/
mobile home installation permits, or other necessary approvals from the City.
The Building Official, or his or her duly designated agent, shall evaluate such
individual assessments under the guidelines provided for in Section F(4) of
this Chapter. If the guidelines are met, the individual assessment shall be
approved by the Building Official, or his or her designated agent, and
forwarded to the City Council within thirty (30) days of receiving such
application.
   2.   Late applications for individual assessments may be submitted within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer
makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were not known or
discoverable prior to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
   3.   The Building Official, or his or her duly designated agent, shall
render a written decision regarding the individual assessment and forward it to
the City Council within thirty (30) days of the date a complete application is
submitted. The decision of the Building Official, or his or her duly designated
agent, shall establish the impact fee for the project in question for a period
of one (1) year from the date said decision becomes final.
   4.   The Building Official, or his or her duly designated agent, shall
evaluate an application for individual assessment and may approve the same if
fee payer has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the established
impact fee is inappropriate and that the following facts and conditions exist:
      a.   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to
the development that do not apply generally to other properties in the vicinity
of the development.
      b.   An individual assessment is necessary for the reasonable and
acceptable development of the property.
      c.   The approval of the individual assessment will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity in
which the development is located.
      d.   The approval of the individual assessment will not adversely affect
the capital improvement plan for the City.
         (1)   Appeals of the Building Official's, or his or her duly
designated agent's, decision regarding determination of individual assessment
shall be made to the City Council by the filing of an appeal with the City
Clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing, faxing, or personal
delivery of written notice of the decision of the Building Official, or his or
her duly designated agent. Final determination regarding individual assessments
shall be made by the City Council.
         (2)   The impact fees and trip generation rates (as determined by the
latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers trip generation manual)
are set forth in the "Report." The City Council may set forth impact fees and
trip generation rates by resolution and modify the same by resolution as
allowed by law. (Ord. 607, 2-12-2020)
CHAPTER 6
GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION
SECTION:
14-6-1:      General Methodology For Calculation
14-6-1: GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION:
A.   The amount of the impact fee shall be calculated using the methodology
contained in the "Report."
B.   A development impact fee shall not exceed a proportionate share of the
cost of system improvements determined in accordance with Section 67-8207,
Idaho Code. Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement
costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
C.   A developer shall have the right to elect to pay a project's proportionate
share of system improvement costs by payment of development impact fees
according to the fee schedule as full and complete payment of the development
project's proportionate share of system improvement costs, except as provided
in Section 67-8214(3), Idaho Code. The schedule of development impact fees for
various land users per unit of development shall be as set forth in the
"Report."
D.   Proportionate Share Determination:
   1.   All development impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair
formula or method under which the development impact fee imposed does not
exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the
City in the provision of system improvements to serve the new development. The
proportionate share is the costs attributable to the new development after the
City considers the following:
      a.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land, or construction of system improvements;
      b.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees, debt service payments, or taxes which
are dedicated for system improvements for which development impact fees would
otherwise be imposed; and
      c.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
   2.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the City:
      a.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area or
areas;
      b.   The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
      c.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the cost
of system improvements through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements
through developer or landowner contributions;
      d.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
      e.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area or areas;
      f.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
      g.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      h.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. The City shall develop a
plan for alternative sources of revenue, which shall include but not
necessarily be limited to plans generated during the City's annual budget
process, lobbying efforts, tax increment financing, implementation of user fees
and various forms of utilities. (Ord. 607, 2-12-2020)
CHAPTER 7
ADMINISTRATION OF IMPACT FEE
SECTION
14-7-1:      Administration Of Impact Fee
14-7-1: ADMINISTRATION OF IMPACT FEE:
A.   Upon receipt of impact fees, the City Clerk, or her or his duly designated
agent, shall be responsible for placement of such funds into separate accounts
as hereinafter specified. All such funds shall be deposited in interest-bearing

deposits of city funds. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to
that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds of
such account.
B.   The City Clerk, or her or his duly designated agent, shall establish
separate accounts and maintain records for each such account whereby impact
fees collected can be segregated.
C.   The City Clerk, or her or his duly designated agent, shall maintain and
keep accurate financial records for each such account for all monies received;
that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be

each impact fee account showing the source and amount of all funds collected
and the projects that were funded.
D.   Development impact fees shall only be spent for the category of system
improvements for which the fees are collected and either within or for the
benefit of the service area in which the project is located.
E.   Unless the City Council deems some other time is appropriate, the City
shall at least once every five (5) years commencing from the date of the
original adoption of the capital improvement plan, review the development
potential of the area and update the capital improvements plan in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Idaho Code Section 67-8206. The City may make
any updates as are deemed necessary as a result of: (1) development occurring
in the prior year; (2) capital improvements actually constructed; (3) changing
facility needs; (4) inflation; (5) revised cost estimates for capital
improvements; (6) changes in the availability of other funding projects; and
(7) such other factors as may be relevant.
F.   The City shall annually adopt a capital budget.
