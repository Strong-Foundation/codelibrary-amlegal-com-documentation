3-5-5: Site Development Standards
3-5-1: PURPOSE:
Wireless communication facilities include antennas (attached and freestanding),
with or without equipment buildings, constructed for the purpose of
transmitting signals for the operation of personal communication systems. These
types of uses are necessary for the day to day function of everyday living and
commerce. Although necessary, these uses can have negative visual impacts to
the community. This chapter is intended to provide standards and a process for
permitting wireless communication facilities to assess and minimize negative
visual impacts, with the maximum number of towers permitted to be three (3).
(Ord. 475, 3-7-2005)
3-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION ANTENNA ARRAY: One or more rods, panels, discs or
similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency (RF)
signals through electromagnetic energy, which may include omnidirectional
antenna (whip), directional antenna (panel) and parabolic antenna (dish).
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FREESTANDING FACILITY: A wireless communication
transmission and/or reception device(s) that is affixed to a structure erected
to support said transmission and/or reception device equipment structure, and
equipment structures and connecting appurtenances. Support structure types
include, but are not limited to, metal poles, lattice towers, wood poles and
guy wires. (Ord. 475, 3-7-2005)
3-5-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   A wireless communication facility shall constitute a special use and
shall be considered under the conditional use section of the commercial and
industrial zoning districts. Conditions that may be appropriate for wireless
communication facilities may include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Modification of the required lot size or setbacks in the zoning
district to accommodate the use;
      2.   Control the location and number of access points to the property;
      3.   Limit the coverage or height of equipment/building structures,
because of obstructions to views or incompatibility with surrounding uses;
      4.   Reduce or expand requirements for screening or landscaping to
maintain the property in character with the surrounding area;
      5.   Establish regulations to protect property or existing improvements
from detrimental effects of the proposed use.
   B.   Parabolic antennas, that are a component of a wireless communication
facility, shall not exceed a diameter of six feet (6').

   D.   Communication antenna arrays may be located on an existing support
structure or building. Location of any antenna array on said existing facility
shall be permitted without a conditional use permit or a site plan review
contingent that there are no substantial changes to the existing support
structure. The antenna array shall not increase the height of said freestanding
facility or facility located on an existing building more than fifteen feet
(15'). Any antenna array that increases the height of said freestanding
facility more than fifteen feet (15') will require a conditional use permit.
   E.   Minor modifications of existing wireless communication facilities are
permitted, provided that there are no significant changes in the visual
appearance of the facility. Minor modifications include, but are not limited
to, the addition of transmission and/or reception device(s) to wireless
communication facilities that meet the provisions of this section.
   F.   If any antenna or tower is not operated for a continuous period of six
(6) months, it shall be considered abandoned. The owner of such antenna or
tower, or property owner, shall remove the same within sixty (60) days after
notice and an opportunity to be heard. If such antenna or tower is not removed
within said sixty (60) days, the city may, at the property owner's expense,
remove the antenna or tower and file a lien on the subject property for
expenses incurred in the removal and any attorney fees associated with the due
process or judicial process incurred by the city. (Ord. 475, 3-7-2005)
3-5-4: APPEARANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   Wireless communication facilities, whether constructed as a permitted
use or as a conditional use, shall be designed to be compatible with and blend
with the natural and built environment. This design includes, but is not
necessarily limited to:

according to the zone in which it is located. Within three hundred feet (300')
of an existing residential use or a residentially zoned lot, the perimeter of
the site shall be landscaped with shrubs and trees that will provide a visual
screening or a visual screening fence. The height of the fence or landscaping
shall be a minimum of six feet (6') and be maintained by the property owner.
   B.   Setback Requirements: Support tower structures shall be set back from
all property lines as required by the building code of the city 1  or two feet
(2') for every ten feet (10') of total tower height, whichever produces the

enjoyment of life or property. (Ord. 482, 6-5-2006)
4-2-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the term "nuisance" is defined to mean any

and as such, shall be abated in the manner provided in this chapter.
No person in charge of or in control of premises, whether as owner, lessee,
tenant, occupant or otherwise, shall allow any nuisance to remain on said
property. Items must be placed neatly on the side of the property behind the
front line of the house. Firewood neatly stacked is exempt and may be in the
front of the house. This includes, but is not limited to, the keeping or the
depositing on, or the scattering over the premises of any of the following:
   A.   Materials: Junk, trash, debris, salvage materials, wood, newspapers,
boxes and the like. Exception to these restrictions are houses under
construction.
   B.   Offensive Debris: Any compost pile or liquid/semi-liquid waste which is
of such a nature as to spread or harbor disease, emit unpleasant odors or
harmful gas, or attract rodents, vermin or other disease carrying pests,
animals or insects; provided, that the presence of earthworms in a compost pile
shall not constitute a nuisance, nor shall a properly maintained garden compost
facility.
   C.   Unsanitary Premises: Keeping unsanitary matter on premises. It shall be
unlawful for any person to keep or permit another to keep upon any premises
deleterious or septic material which causes adverse effects upon the occupancy
or use of neighboring lands. Such materials must generally be retained in
containers or vessels which deny access by humans, flies, insects, rodents and
animals.
   D.   Weeds And Plants: All uncultivated unmowed grasses, noxious weeds and
all other rank uncultivated vegetation over eight inches (8") tall, other than
trees, shrubs and cultivated plants, flowers and agricultural products.
In addition to vegetation listed under this subsection, any tree, shrub or
other plant material that meets any of the following definitions shall be
considered a nuisance under this chapter:
      1.   Puncture vines;
      2.   Poison oak, poison ivy or other rank, noxious and dangerous
vegetation; and
      3.   Thorned plants that extend into a public way or pathway, cross a
property line or that are used for habitation for trespassers; or
      4.   Any vegetation that is:
         a.   A health hazard;
         b.   A fire hazard. In determining whether a fire hazard exists, the
code enforcement officer may consider the following factors:
            (1)   Whether the situation is present during the dry season, May 1
through October 30;
            (2)   Whether the lack of rain for ten (10) continuous days has
negatively affected soil moisture content;
            (3)   Whether the average air temperature has been above seventy
degrees Fahrenheit (70°F) for ten (10) continuous days; and
            (4)   Whether the vegetation is within ten feet (10') of any
combustible material or other structure or property which could be damaged by
fire.
         c.   A traffic hazard, because it impairs the view of a public street,
or impairs the view of any traffic control device, or otherwise makes use of
the street hazardous. (Ord. 482, 6-5-2006)
   E.   Abandoned, Wrecked Personal Property: No person in charge of or in
control of premises, whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant or otherwise,
shall allow any partially dismantled, wrecked, junked, discarded or otherwise
nonoperating and/or unlicensed vehicle (including, but not limited to,
automobiles, trucks, trailers, ATVs, snowmobiles, motorcycles, campers),
machinery, implement and/or equipment and personal property of any kind, which
is no longer safely usable for the purposes for which it was manufactured,
specifically any vehicle that does not have affixed to the vehicle a current
state of Idaho license tag, off road vehicle registration and/or recreational
vehicle license to remain on such property longer than fifteen (15) days unless
such vehicle, equipment, etc., is maintained in an enclosed building, as
defined by the zoning ordinance of the city, such that the materials are not
readily visible from any public place or from any surrounding private property.
Allowing such materials to remain unenclosed shall constitute a nuisance. The
absence of a current state of Idaho license from any vehicle shall be
presumptive evidence that such vehicle is abandoned, discarded, scrapped,
ruined or junked.
This subsection shall not apply with regard to any vehicle, equipment or other
personal property on the premises of a business enterprise operated in a lawful
place, other than in a residential district, and operated in a lawful manner,
when the keeping or maintenance of such vehicle, equipment or other damaged and
abandoned personal property is necessary to the operation of such business
enterprise and is not in violation of other provisions of law so long as the
vehicles, equipment or other personal property on the premises of the business
enterprise is located within a sight obscured fenced enclosure. (Ord. 541, 7-5-

4-2-7: ABATEMENT PROCEDURES:
   A.   Authority: Upon notice to the owner, the city is empowered to abate any
violation of this chapter by causing the cutting and removal of trees, weeds
and grass, and the removal of rubbish upon and from private property within the
city and the parking within the curbing abutting same, and to assess the cost
thereof against the private property so cleared, and that which is adjacent to
the parking/landscape strip between the sidewalks and curb and any alley so
cleaned pursuant to Idaho Code 50-317. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
chapter, nothing addressed hereby shall preclude the city from acting upon
conditions that constitute a nuisance pursuant to provisions of Idaho Code and
pursuing abatement as provided thereby.
   B.   Notice: Whenever a city staff member or authorized agent finds that a
violation does exist, pursuant to any provisions of this chapter, he may
initiate enforcement by giving notice, by certified and first class mail
addressed to the last known address of the owner of record or by personally
serving the notice upon the owner of record, and if there is more than one
owner of record, by such mail or personal service to any one of such owners.
Said notice shall be mailed to the owner, agent or person in charge of such
property, if such owner, agent or person in charge can be found. If an owner,
agent or person in charge cannot be found, then notice shall be provided by
posting a notice upon a conspicuous place on the premises and mailing a copy of
said notice by certified mail to the owner or agent of the same at such owner's
or agent's last known address. Such notice shall specify the violations
required to be abated and the manner and time limits by which the owner of the
property is required to achieve compliance.
   C.   Owner To Abate: It shall be the duty of the owner of private property
whose use constitutes a violation of this chapter to cut, trim or remove such
accumulations or growth immediately upon receipt of notice from the city, in no
case less than the time frame stated in the notice which shall provide at least
seven (7) days for performance unless an emergency is found to exist.
   D.   Appeals: If the property owner receiving notice to abate a violation of
this chapter contests the determination, a written appeal of the notice may be
filed with the city clerk within no more than seven (7) days of transmittal of
the notice to abate a violation. The city council shall hear the appeal as soon
as possible. A decision shall be rendered in writing as soon as practical. Any
decision rendered by the city shall be final.
   E.   Abatement By City; Collection Of Costs:
      1.   In any case where a person required under this chapter does not
abate the violation, the city, through its own personnel, contractor and/or
agents, may enter upon the premises to cut, trim or remove weeds, brush piles,
vegetative litter or nuisance tree or shrub growth, remove trash and abate all
nuisances described in this chapter.
      2.   The total cost of the abatement shall be billed to the owner of the
property for payment. In the event payment is not made within thirty (30) days,
or if the owner or whereabouts of the owner are not known, the cost of
abatement may be certified by the city clerk and forwarded to the county
treasurer for inclusion in the county property tax assessment pursuant to Idaho
Code 50-1008. Pursuit of the abatement by the city shall not preclude
prosecution of violations of this chapter.
      3.   An error in the name of the responsible person shall not void the
assessment, nor will a failure to receive the notice of the proposed assessment
render the assessment void, but it shall remain a valid assessment against the
property.
      4.   The lien shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per
annum, with interest to commence from the date of entry of the lien in the lien
docket. (Ord. 482, 6-5-2006)
4-2-8: PENALTY:
Any owner or other person notified to abate the described nuisance who shall
fail to abate such violation within the time specified in the notice, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. However, the city's prosecuting attorney may
elect to refrain from initiating criminal prosecution on the violation if the
violator pays to the city clerk, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the
complaint of such violation a civil assessment in the amount set forth in
section
1-4-5 of this code.
Every day such violation continues after the date specified in the notice shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense, punishable as provided in the
general penalty in section
1-4-1 of this code.

conflict with subsection B of this section.
      9.   Duplicate street names are prohibited. Existing duplicated names
should be corrected in accordance with this chapter.
   B.   Addressing Procedures:
      1.   General Procedures: All address numbers shall conform to the
addressing system outlined by this chapter. The general standards to be used in
developing an address are as follows:
         a.   The address system shall be based on a mileage system by
measuring to the one one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a mile. The point of beginning
for generally north/south streets shall be U.S. 2 and the point of beginning
for generally east/west streets shall be SR 57. All streets that continue
across U.S. 2 shall be prefixed north or south and all streets that continue
across SR 57 shall be prefixed east or west.
         b.   Addressing for state highways shall be based on mile markers.
(Example: If a driveway is on Highway 2 and it is between mile marker 5 and 6
and the measurement from mile marker 5 to the driveway is 0.425 miles, the
address for this driveway is 5425 Highway 2.)
         c.   A standard of one thousand (1,000) addressing units per mile is
hereby established.
         d.   Even numbers shall be used on west and south sides of the street,
and odd numbers should be used on the east and north sides.
      2.   Streets:
         a.   If a building has a number of entrances, each serving separate
occupants, then the building shall be assigned an address and the individual
units assigned unit numbers. (Example: 24 Birch Rd., Suite 3.)
         b.   An addressing scheme for multi-family dwelling structures shall
be approved by the administrator that is in accord with the standards and
guidelines outlined in subsection
7-3-1C4 of this chapter. In general, a multi-family dwelling structure with one
main entrance should be assigned one number with the owner of the structure
responsible for providing designated individual numbering of each unit before
an address will be issued to the structure. (Example: 15864 Maas Loop, Apt.
101.) In some cases where there are several multi-family dwelling structures
sharing one main access, it may be necessary to name the streets within the
complex and provide individual street numbers to the buildings. This
determination will be made by the administrator on a case by case basis.
         c.   An addressing scheme for mobile home parks structures shall be
approved by the administrator that is in accord with E-
9-1-1 addressing standards. In general, mobile home parks should have names for
the streets within the complex and individual street numbers should be assigned
by the city for each mobile home space. Alphanumeric combinations shall not be
used for numbering individual spaces.
         d.   If a street or driveway accesses three (3) or more properties, it
shall be assigned a street name and the parcels shall be addressed in
accordance with this chapter.
         e.   Parcels with structure(s), or bare land parcels, which are
accessed by a driveway, shall be assigned an address at the point where the
driveway intersects a named street.
         f.   The street name and address for any dwelling should be determined
by the street on which the dwelling fronts. However, in those instances where
access is from a different street and the dwelling is not visible from the
fronting street, or if the dwelling is not readily accessible to emergency
personnel from the fronting street, the street name and address will be
assigned based on the access street.
         g.   For parcels that are accessed by multiple driveways, the owner
shall designate a primary access point that will be used for address
assignment. Such access points are subject to review and approval of the city
to ensure that they are accessible to emergency service providers. If the
property owner does not designate a primary access point, the city shall make
the official determination to allow the proper addressing of the property.
         h.   Circular and loop streets should begin numbering at the lower
numbered intersection, with odd and even numbers following the set standard.
         i.   For circle streets, the numbering should begin at its origin and
proceed in a counterclockwise direction around the circle using a consecutive
numerical order and odd/even numbers consistent with the beginning of the
street as if the street were straight.
         j.   Parcels served by a common driveway that access two (2) parcels
should be assigned an address at the point where the access intersects a public
or private street or named common driveway. Each property shall be assigned a
different address. If the city issues multiple addresses to a parcel pursuant
to this section, the city may also require that the common driveway be named in
the same manner as private streets.
         k.   Fractional addresses (56981/2 Happy Trail Street) and hyphenated
address numbers (632-58 Kennedy) shall not be used.
         l.   Parcels with multiple structures will be addressed on a case by
case basis.
      3.   Waterfront:
         a.   A shoreline distance based system may be used by the emergency
service agencies to assign numerical points to facilitate emergency responses.
These marine response identification numbers shall not be used as addresses
except for those parcels that do not have any access other than by water.
         b.   Marine response identification numbers should be based on a
shoreline distance measurement. Starting points shall be established at a
readily identified point on the water body and numbered consecutively. Odd and
even numbers may occur along the same shore.
   C.   Street Naming Standards:
      1.   It is hereby established that the following rules and regulations
for the naming of streets shall apply. All official street names shall be
assembled in the Bonner County road name list. Additions and amendments to the
list shall be made by the administrator. All new street names or changes to
names shall be established in accordance with the standards and procedures
hereinafter set forth. If possible, surnames should not be used.
      2.   The following standards shall be used in determining and approving
street names:
         a.   All proposed street names shall be submitted to the administrator
for review and approval.
         b.   Street names should be easy to communicate (e.g., across
electronic communication devices) and shall not be offensive to the standards
of good taste.
         c.   There shall be no duplication of names by sound or spelling
(example: Briar Street, Brier Street).
         d.   Variations of the same name with a different street designation
shall be prohibited within the first word of the two (2) word title or in the
street extension (example: Pine Street, Pine Drive, White Pine Street, White
Lilly Lane).
         e.   When a proposed street is in general alignment with an existing
street, and the proposed street is or planned to be a continuation of the
existing street, the existing name and designation should be maintained.
         f.   Where a proposed street connects, or aligns with, two (2)
different streets each having different names, the administrator shall decide
the name to be used, giving consideration to the length, classification, period
of usage and number of residents affected.
         g.   Both "L" shaped and "T" shaped streets should carry the same name
if either leg is one hundred feet (100') or less in length. "L" shaped and "T"
shaped streets over one hundred feet (100') in length each should carry a
different name on each leg of the "L" or the "T". This determination shall be
made on a case by case basis.
         h.   In general, street names should consist of no more than three (3)
words or contain over sixteen (16) letters in length including spaces, unless
otherwise approved by the administrator. The street direction (N, S, E, W) and
designation (e.g., street, lane, court, etc.) is not included. All names should
conform to this limitation except where existing names are to be continued due
to alignments.
         i.   There shall be no duplication of existing names. The city will
recognize Bonner County as the repository for the official list of street names
for the city.
         j.   No street shall have more than one name.
         k.   No street name shall contain the words north, south, east, or
west, or any combination thereof, within the street name except for use as a
prefix to names of streets crossing either U.S. 2 or SR 57.
   D.   New Streets Or Existing Unnamed Streets:
      1.   Any new street to be established within the city, public or private,
or any existing unnamed street, public or private, shall require a street name
approved by the administrator.
      2.   In the case of plats, approved street names shall be specified on
the final plat map.
   E.   Official Designation Of Existing Street Names: With the adoption of
this chapter, all streets named as a result of the city mapping and rural
addressing project for enhanced 911 shall be designated as the official street
names.
   F.   Renaming Streets:
      1.   Renaming Of Existing Duplicated Street Names: Where duplicate names
exist, streets should be renamed by the administrator to eliminate the
duplication. The administrator shall decide which streets shall be renamed
using the following criteria:
         a.   When the street was originally named.
         b.   The number of improved properties served by the street.
         c.   Other factors as deemed appropriate by the administrator.
         d.   When a street name within the incorporated area of the city is
duplicated by a street name within the county, the county shall work with the
city to decide which street shall be renamed.
      2.   Renaming Other Streets: In cases where property owners request to
change the name of a street which has an existing city approved name, the
property owners may petition the city. Property owner initiated requests under
this section shall require seventy five percent (75%) approval of property
owners abutting the street and the payment of an applicable fee and any other
costs incurred. Street names shall not be changed more frequently than once
every five (5) years.
   G.   Signage:
      1.   Physical Addresses: Physical address numbers shall be clearly
readable from the streetway, and shall contrast with background. If a structure
is more than seventy five feet (75') from the street, or is otherwise not
clearly visible from the street, its address shall be posted at the
intersection of its access street and public or private street. The address
sign should be no less than four feet (4') nor more than six feet (6') above
the ground and mounted on support structure not exceeding the standards listed
in section 8 of the "Street Standards Manual" (title 2, BCRC) published by the
Bonner County public works department. The view of the address from the street
must be unobstructed and maintained. All primary letters, numbers and symbols
should be a minimum of three and one-half inches (31/2") in height, with a one-
half inch (1/2") stroke, and should contrast with the background color. The
city shall not be liable for any damage to the address sign and support
structure. The city shall not be liable for any damage caused by the
installation of the address sign and support structure.
      2.   Marine Response Identification Numbers:
         a.   Where a marine response identification number is used as an
address for a parcel, the number should be posted on a pier, dock or other
waterfront appurtenance, no less than four feet (4') nor more than six feet
(6') above the ground or high water line. The sign must be clearly readable to
emergency providers arriving by boat.
         b.   In cases where the marine response identification number is not
used as an address (where street access is available and a street address has
been issued), the marine response identification number should be posted in
accordance with the policies of the emergency service providers.
   H.   Street Sign Standards:

9-3-5: CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS:
The capital improvement projects to be financed by the impact fee are those as
listed in the "report", incorporated herein by reference along with all
footnotes, exhibits, appendices, and other attachments referenced. (Ord. 510,
3-17-2008)
9-3-6: CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEE:
   A.   Procedure: The city shall calculate the amount of the impact fee due
for each building permit and manufactured/mobile home installation permit by
the procedure set forth in the "report".
   B.   Accordance With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: The
calculation of a development impact fee shall be in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A development impact fee shall not be deemed
invalid because payment of the fee may result in an incidental benefit to
owners or developers within the service area other than the person paying the
fee.
   C.   Calculation On Basis Of Performance Standard: A development impact fee
shall be calculated on the basis of the performance standard for public
facilities adopted in this chapter and in the "report" that are applicable to
existing development as well as new growth and development. The construction,
improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing public facilities for
which a development impact fee is imposed must be attributable to the capacity
demands generated by the new development.
   D.   Calculation For Development With Mixed Uses: If the development for
which a building permit is sought contains a mix of uses, the impact fee will
be calculated for each type of use.
   E.   Certification: Prior to making an application for a building permit or
manufactured/mobile home installation permit, a prospective applicant may
request in writing a written certification of the development impact fee
schedule or individual assessment for a particular project which shall
establish the development fee for a period of one year from the date of
certification. The certification shall include an explanation of facilities
considered under section 67-8207, Idaho Code. The certification shall specify
the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be used.
   F.   Individual Assessment: Individual assessment of impact fees is
permitted in situations where the fee payer can demonstrate by clear and
convincing evidence that the established impact fee is inappropriate.
      1.   Individual assessments of development impact fees may be made by
application to the city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, prior to
receiving building permits, manufactured/mobile home installation permits, or
other necessary approvals from the city. The city clerk, or his or her duly
designated agent, shall evaluate such individual assessments under the
guidelines provided for in subsection F4 of this section. If the guidelines are
met, the individual assessment shall be approved by the city clerk, or his or
her duly designated agent. Any decision regarding a request for an individual
assessment shall be provided in writing to the applicant and a copy of said
decision, along with supporting documentation, shall be provided to the city
council within thirty (30) days of the decision.
      2.   Late applications for individual assessments may be submitted within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer
makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were not known or
discoverable prior to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship
would result if said application is not considered.
      3.   The city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall render a
written decision regarding the individual assessment and forward it to the city
council within thirty (30) days of the date a complete application is
submitted. The decision of the city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent,
shall establish the impact fee for the project in question for a period of one
year from the date said decision becomes final.
      4.   The city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall evaluate
an application for individual assessment and may approve the same if fee payer
has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the established impact fee is
inappropriate and that the following facts and conditions exist:
         a.   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to
the development that does not apply generally to other properties in the
vicinity of the development.
         b.   An individual assessment is necessary for the reasonable and
acceptable development of the property.
         c.   The approval of the individual assessment will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity in
which the development is located.
         d.   The approval of the individual assessment will not adversely
affect the capital improvement plan for the city.
      5.   Appeals to the city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent,
determination of individual assessment shall be made to the city council by the
filing of an appeal with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of
mailing, faxing, or personal delivery of written notice of the decision of the
city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent. Final determination regarding
the appeal of individual assessments shall be made by the city council. (Ord.
510, 3-17-2008)
9-3-7: GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION:
   A.   Calculation Methodology: The amount of the impact fee shall be
calculated using the methodology contained in the "report".
   B.   Fee Not To Exceed Proportionate Share: A development impact fee shall
not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements determined
in accordance with section 67-8207, Idaho Code. Development impact fees shall
be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such
costs.
   C.   Fee Schedule: A developer shall have the right to elect to pay a
project's proportionate share of system improvement costs by payment of
development impact fees according to the fee schedule as full and complete
payment of the development project's proportionate share of system improvement
costs, except as provided in section 67-8214(3), Idaho Code. The schedule of
development impact fees for various land users per unit of development shall be
as set forth in the "report".
   D.   Proportionate Share Determination:
      1.   All development impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair
formula or method under which the development impact fee imposed does not
exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the
city in the provision of system improvements to serve the new development. The
proportionate share is the cost attributable to the new development after the
city considers the following:
         a.   Any appropriate credit, offset, or contribution of money,
dedication of land, or construction of system improvements;
         b.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees, debt service payments, or taxes which
are dedicated for system improvements for which development impact fees would
otherwise be imposed; and
         c.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
      2.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the city:
         a.   The cost of existing system improvements within the service area
or areas;
         b.   The means by which existing system improvements have been
financed;
         c.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to the
cost of system improvements through taxation, assessments, or developer or
landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system
improvements through developer or landowner contributions;
         d.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute
to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
         e.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area or areas;
         f.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
         g.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
         h.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. The city shall develop a
plan for alternative sources of revenue, which shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, plans generated during the city's annual budget
process, lobbying efforts, tax increment financing, implementation of user fees
and various forms of utilities. (Ord. 510, 3-17-2008)
9-3-8: INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT INDEX FOR IMPACT FEE:
This chapter provides for an automatic annual adjustment to the impact fee
based on the constructions materials index for Seattle. The adjustment may
increase or decrease the impact fee depending on the value of the index for
that year. The annual effective date of this fee adjustment shall coincide with
the beginning date of the city's annual budget. (Ord. 510, 3-17-2008)
9-3-9: ADMINISTRATION OF IMPACT FEE:
   A.   Transfer Of Funds To City Treasurer: Upon receipt of impact fees, the
city treasurer, or his or her duly designated agent, shall be responsible for
placement of such funds into separate accounts as hereinafter specified. All
such funds shall be deposited in interest bearing accounts, within the capital
projects fund, in a bank authorized to receive deposits of city funds. Interest
earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used
solely for the purposes specified for funds of such account.
   B.   Establishment And Maintenance Of Accounts: The city treasurer, or his
or her duly designated agent, shall establish separate accounts and maintain
records for each such account whereby impact fees collected can be segregated.
   C.   Maintenance Of Records: The city treasurer, or his or her duly
designated agent, shall maintain and keep accurate financial records for each
such account that shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues; that
shall account for all monies received; that shall ensure that the disbursement
of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the
provision of projects specified in the capital improvements program; and that
shall provide an annual accounting for each impact fee account showing the
source and amount of all funds collected and the projects that were funded.
   D.   Expenditure Of Fees: Development impact fees shall only be spent for
the public facility category (i.e., parks, police, fire and circulation) of
system improvements for which the fees are collected and either within or for
the benefit of the service area in which the project is located.
   E.   Review And Modification: Unless the city council deems some other time
period is appropriate, the city shall at least once every five (5) years
commencing from the date of the original adoption of the capital improvement
plan, review the development potential of the area and update the capital
improvements plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in Idaho Code
section 67-8206. The city may make any updates as are deemed necessary as a
result of: 1) development occurring in the prior year; 2) capital improvements
actually constructed; 3) changing facility needs; 4) inflation; 5) revised cost
estimates for capital improvements; 6) changes in the availability of other
funding projects; and 7) such other factors as may be relevant.
   F.   Capital Budget: The city shall annually adopt a capital budget.

   A.   In the calculation of development impact fees for a particular project,
credit or reimbursement shall be given for the present value of any
construction of system improvements or contribution or dedication of land or
money required by the city from a developer for system improvements of the
public facility category (i.e., parks, police, circulation) for which the
development impact fee is being collected. Credit or reimbursement shall not be
given for project improvements unless those improvements are identified in the
"report" as a system improvement. In that event, the credit given will only be
given for those project improvements that are specifically listed in the
"report" and not for any portion of the improvements that would otherwise be
required by zoning, subdivision, or other city regulations.
   B.   If a developer is required to construct, fund or contribute system
improvements in excess of the development project's proportionate share of
system improvement costs, the developer shall receive a credit on future impact
fees or be reimbursed at the developer's choice for such excess construction,
funding or contribution from development impact fees paid by future development
which impacts the system improvements constructed, funded or contributed by the
developer(s) or fee payer. If a credit for the payment of future impact fees is
requested, the credit shall be given only for the public facility category that
received system improvements in excess of the development's proportionate
share.
   C.   If credit or reimbursement is due to the developer pursuant to this
section, the city shall enter into a written agreement, with the fee payer,
negotiated in good faith, prior to the construction, funding, or contribution.
The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount, time and
form of reimbursement.
   D.   Any person requesting such credit or reimbursement shall submit their
request in writing on a form provided by the city and present documentation of
costs or payments for facilities to the city clerk or his or her duly
designated agent prior to issuance of a building permit or manufactured/mobile
home installation permit. The determination shall be made no more than forty
five (45) days after complete documentation is submitted to the city clerk or
his or her duly designated agent. Any appeal from such a determination by the
city clerk, or his or her duly designated agent, shall be pursuant to section
9-3-12 of this chapter. (Ord. 510, 3-17-2008)
9-3-11: REFUNDS:
   A.   The current owner or contract purchaser of property on which an impact
fee has been paid may request a refund of such fee if:
      1.   Service is available but never provided;
      2.   The project for which a building permit has been used has been
lawfully altered resulting in a decrease in the amount of the impact fee due;

fee, however, a fee payer can pay a development impact fee under protest in
order to obtain development approval or building permit.
   D.   Upon voluntary agreement by the fee payer and the city, any
disagreement related to the impact fee for the proposed development may be
mediated by a qualified independent party.
      1.   Mediation may take place at any time during the appeals process and
participation in mediation does not preclude the fee payer from pursuing other
remedies provided for in this chapter.
      2.   The fee payer and the city shall share mediation costs equally.
(Ord. 510, 3-17-2008)
9-3-13: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS:
In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system improvements to be
paid by the developer, the city clerk or his or her duly designated agent shall
consider whether any extraordinary costs will be incurred in serving the
development based upon an "extraordinary impact" as defined in section
9-3-2 of this chapter. This determination shall be made prior to issuance of
any permit for development and shall be paid prior to any such issuance except
as may be provided pursuant to a private agreement between the parties as
authorized by Idaho Code section 67-8214.
If the city clerk or his or her duly designated agent determines that the
development will result in an extraordinary impact, it shall advise the fee
payer in writing what the extraordinary impact is, the reason for the
extraordinary impact, and the estimated costs to be incurred as a result of the
extraordinary impact.
Nothing in this chapter shall obligate the city to approve any development that
results in extraordinary impact.
The fee payer may appeal the determination of an extraordinary impact or the
amount of extraordinary costs incurred in writing by filing a notice of appeal
to the city council with the city clerk pursuant to the terms set forth in
section
9-3-12, "Appeals", of this chapter. When filing an appeal, the fee payer shall
submit a letter providing the reason for the appeal along with supporting

   B.   Airport Height Restriction Zones (Height Zones): In order to carry out
the provisions of this title, there are hereby created and established certain
zones which are shown on the Airport's Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) part
77 Airspace Drawings. One original, official, and identical copy of the FAR
part 77 Airspace Drawings reflecting the boundaries of the airport Height Zones
of Priest River, Idaho is hereby adopted, and the Council is hereby authorized
to sign and attest the map as the official Priest River Airport FAR part 77
Airspace Drawings of Priest River, Idaho.
One copy shall be filed in the Office of the City Clerk and shall be designated
as exhibit 1. The City Clerk shall maintain this copy by posting thereon all
subsequent changes and amendments.
Each portion of an area located in more than one of the following zones shall
be evaluated independently according to the zone in which it is located.
      1.   Non-Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Utility Aircraft):
The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is five hundred feet (500') wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of two thousand feet (2,000') at a horizontal distance
five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      2.   Visual Runway Approach Zone (Larger Than Utility Runway): The inner
edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is five hundred feet (500') wide. The approach surface expands uniformly to a
width of one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') at a horizontal distance five
thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      3.   Visual Runway Approach Zone (Utility Aircraft): The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two
hundred fifty feet (250') wide. The approach surface expands uniformly to a
width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal distance
five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      4.   Transitional Zone: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
      5.   Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs
of five thousand feet (5,000') or ten thousand feet (10,000') radii from the
center of each end of the primary surface of the primary runway and connecting
the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone
does not include the approach and transitional zones. The horizontal zone was
constructed with ten thousand feet (10,000') radii.
      6.   Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000').
   C.   Airport Height Zone Limitations: Pursuant to this section and except as
otherwise provided in this title, no structure shall be erected, altered, or
maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any Height Zone created by
this section to a height more than the applicable height limit herein
established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the Height Zones in question as follows:
      1.   Non-Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone (Utility Aircraft):
Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of
and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of five thousand feet (5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
      2.   Visual Runway Approach Zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet
(5,000') along the extended runway centerline. (Ord. 597, 8-6-2018)
      3.   Transitional Zone: Slopes seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of one hundred fifty
feet (150') above the airport elevation. In addition, there are established
height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending to
where they intersect the conical surface. Where the non-precision instrument
runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established
height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at
the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending a
horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') measured at ninety degree
(90°) angles to the extended runway centerline. (Ord. 605, 8-5-2019)
      4.   Horizontal Zone: Established at one hundred fifty feet (150') above
the airport elevation.
      5.   Conical Zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty feet (350') above the airport elevation.
   D.   Excepted Height Limitations: In the area lying within the limits of the
Horizontal and Conical Zones, nothing in this Code shall be construed as
prohibiting the construction, maintenance, or growth of anything to a height
that is less than one hundred fifty feet (150') above the surface of the land,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such
structure or growth would extend above the height limits prescribed herein.
   E.   Airport Compatible Land Use Overlay Zones (Land Use Zones): The
controlled area of the airport is divided into Airport Compatible Land Use
Overlay Zones (Land Use Zones). The purpose of such zones shall be to regulate
the development of noise sensitive land uses; promote compatibility between the
airport and the surrounding land uses; protect the airport from incompatible
development; and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of property
users. The Airport Land Use Zones established herein shall be known as:
      1.   Runway Protection Zone (RPZ)
      2.   Lateral Safety Zone (LSZ)
      3.   Critical Zone (ICZ)
      4.   Traffic Pattern Area (TPA)

shown on the official map, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest runway end shown on the
map.
      2.   Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest physical feature shown
on the map.
      3.   Distances not specifically indicated on the original Airport Land
Use Zone Map shall be determined by a scaled measurement on the map.
Where physical features on the ground differ from the information shown on the
official Airport Land Use Zone Map or when there arises a question as to how or
where a parcel of property is zoned, and such questions cannot be resolved by
the application of this subsection F, the property shall be classified as the
most restrictive Airport Land Use Zone.
Where a parcel of land lies within more than one Airport Land Use Zone, the
zone within which each portion of the property is located shall apply
individually to each portion of the development.
   G.   Airport Land Use Zone Map: The boundaries of the Airport Land Use Zones
set out herein shall be delineated upon the airport's Airport Land Use Zone
Map, with said maps being adopted by reference and made a part of this Code as
fully as if the same were set forth herein in detail.
One original, official, and identical copy of the Airport Land Use Zone Map
that reflects the boundaries of the Airport Land Use Zones is hereby adopted,
and the Council is hereby authorized to sign and attest the map as the official
Airport Land Use Zone Map of Priest River, Idaho, and such map shall be filed
and maintained as follows:
      1.   One copy shall be filed in the Office of the City Clerk and shall be
within exhibit 1. The City Clerk shall maintain this copy by posting thereon
all subsequent changes and amendments.
   H.   Use Of Land And Buildings: Within the Airport Land Use Zones as defined
herein, no land shall hereafter be used, and no structure or other object shall
hereafter be erected, altered, converted, or modified other than for those
compatible land uses permitted by the underlying comprehensive zoning
districts, as specified in this title. Additional land uses are prohibited in
the Airport Land Use Zones, regardless of underlying zoning, as set forth in
the Airport Compatible Land Use Table designated as exhibit 2 on file with the
City.
Where any use of prohibited land and buildings set forth in this section
conflicts with any use of land and buildings set forth in this title and/or
Zoning Map, this chapter shall apply.
   I.   Additional Land Use Regulations: On property within the Airport Land
Use Zone Map jurisdiction, but outside the jurisdictional limits of Priest
River, Idaho, this section shall be used to formulate land use recommendations
or responses to land use comment requests from other jurisdictions.
In the event of conflict between this section and any aviation hazard
restriction, the most restrictive provision shall apply.
   J.   Disclosure Statement: Fair Disclosure Statement shall be provided to
any applicant for a permit within an airport zone, or any prospective buyers of
any structure or property within such zones. Further, the Fair Disclosure
Statement shall serve to notify prospective buyers of property near airports
that subject property is subject to the provisions of this section and lies
within the Airport Influence Area and under the airport's FAR part 77 airspace.
As such, it may be necessary to clear and keep clear the airspace of any
portions of buildings, structures, or improvements of any and all kinds, and of
trees, vegetation, or other objects. This includes reserving the right of the
City to require: removal or demolishment of those portions of such buildings,
structures, improvements, trees, or any other objects which extend into the
airspace; cut to the ground level and remove any trees which extend into the
airspace; the right to mark and light, or cause or require to be marked or
lighted, as obstructions to air navigation, any and all buildings, structures,
or other improvements, and trees or other objects now upon, or that in the
future may be upon, said parcel, and which extend into the airspace. The Fair
Disclosure Statement shall also notify applicant for permit or prospective
buyers that they may be exposed to potentially impactive levels of aircraft
overflight, including but not limited to noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel or
fuel particles, and other effects that may be caused by normal aircraft
operations in or around an airport.
Before a permit shall be issued, the applicant shall sign the Fair Disclosure
Statement and the Fair Disclosure Statement will be recorded in the deed
records of the County. Upon the applicant's refusal, the City shall acknowledge
that the applicant was made aware of the above- described impacts. Such
statement shall be recorded in the deed records of the County.
Nothing stated herein is meant to provide pilots, crews, owners of aircraft, or

10-7-3: SHORELINE DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: Shoreline areas are valuable and fragile natural
resources and as such special provisions must be made for their protection,
utilization, restoration, and preservation.
   B.   Definitions: For the purpose of this section, the following words are
defined:
   DEVELOPMENT: A use consisting of the construction or exterior alteration of
structures; dredging; drilling; dumping; filling; removal of any sand, gravel,
or mineral; bulk heading; driving of piling; placing of obstructions; or any
project of a permanent or temporary nature, which occurs within a shoreline
area or below the ordinary high water mark of surface waters, or interferes
with the normal public use of surface waters and/or shoreline areas, except the
following shall be excluded from this definition:
      1.   Normal maintenance of existing structures or developments, including
damage by accident, fire, or elements.
      2.   Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by
the elements.
      3.   Construction and practices normal or necessary for the construction
and maintenance of irrigation structures including but not limited to head
gates, pumping facilities, and irrigation channels. Provided, that activities
of a commercial nature, alteration of the contour of the shoreline area by
leveling or filling other than that which results from normal cultivation,
shall not be considered normal or necessary activities.
      4.   Operation, maintenance, or construction of canals, waterways,
drains, reservoirs, or other facilities that now exist or are hereafter created
or developed as a part of an irrigation system for the primary purpose of
making use of system waters, including return flow and artificially stored
ground water from the irrigation of lands.
      5.   Operation and maintenance of any system of dikes, ditches, drains,
or other facilities existing on the effective date of this section which were
created, developed, or utilized primarily as a part of a drainage or diking
system.
   ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK: The ordinary high-water mark on all lakes and
streams is that mark found by examining the bed and banks and ascertaining
where the presence and action of waters are common and usual, and continuation
throughout ordinary years, has created a mark upon the soil, of distinct
characteristic, from that of the abutting upland soils.
   SHORELINE AREAS: Shoreline areas shall mean those lands extending landward
for two hundred feet (200') in all directions as measured on a horizontal plane
from the ordinary high-water mark.
   SURFACE WATERS: All lakes, streams, and other bodies of water, within the
area of City jurisdiction, are the surface waters as covered by this section.
   C.   Compliance: Any person planning to conduct a development, as defined by
this section, shall comply with the following standards:
      1.   All construction development shall be set back at least forty feet
(40') from the ordinary high-water mark.
      2.   All construction development shall be in compliance with section
10-7-4, “Stormwater Management”, of this chapter.
      3.   All construction development shall have necessary permitting and/or
letters of compliance from all affected agencies before construction begins.
All future construction on the same parcel of land shall have separate
permitting and/or letters of compliance.
   D.   Penalties: Penalties for noncompliance with this section shall be those
penalties prescribed in section
10-15-3 of this title. (Ord. 597, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 634, 6-17-2024)
10-7-4: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT:
   A.   Intent: The intent of this section is to require implementation of
surface water management techniques which rely upon natural on-site treatment
and recycling of stormwater as opposed to collection and conveyance of
untreated stormwater into ground water sources or into surface bodies of water.
However, the City has established a stormwater collection system in certain
areas of the City limits and will review proposals to determine the feasibility
of future connections to this system.
The desired goal for implementation of such regulations is the protection of
ground water quality through pretreatment of stormwater prior to infiltration
and protection of surface water resources from the effects of contaminants,
sedimentation, and erosion.
   B.   Applicability: The achievement of standards, employment of methods, and
techniques required by this section shall be applicable in the following
circumstances:
      1.   Development of every new subdivision of land within the jurisdiction
of the City of Priest River;
      2.   All commercial and industrial site development for which grading,
site development, construction, or building permits may be required pursuant to
the land use regulations of the City of Priest River;
      3.   All public projects within the jurisdiction of Priest River
including, but not limited to, street construction or reconstruction
(modification of the cross-section, not to include resurfacing), park
development, building development, or other public works construction or
development. Except as necessary to maintain the continuity of existing
stormwater handling systems, all new construction as outlined in this
subsection B, shall employ the methods for stormwater management required by
this section and shall otherwise be designed to minimize adverse impacts upon
the surface and ground water quality; and
      4.   Every building or land development permit where land- disturbing
activity is to occur on any part of sites with a slope greater than eight
percent (8%) or on sites less than three hundred feet (300') distant
horizontally from and located vertically above any surface water in the form of
a perennial or intermittent stream, river, pond, lake, wetland, or similar
surface feature which can be determined from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle
topographic maps. Stormwater Management Plans may not be necessary for
individual building sites if runoff from the site has been accommodated by an
approved Stormwater Management Plan for the subdivision in which the site is
located. However, detailed erosion control plans may still be required. The
Administrator may allow a building permit to be issued for minor additions to
existing improvements without the preparation of a Stormwater Management Plan
if, in using their professional judgement, the requirements of this section can
be met by existing site conditions.
   C.   General Requirements: Unless otherwise lawfully excused from compliance
with the standards set forth in this section, all development to which this
section is applicable shall comply with the following requirements and methods
for stormwater management control:
      1.   Stormwater, in accordance with the performance standards set forth
herein, shall be directed by non-erosive means to grass infiltration areas
(GIAs) when appropriate. If the proposed development exceeds site limitations
for grass infiltration methods, then an acceptable alternative stormwater
collection, treatment, disposal system shall be implemented in accordance with
an approved stormwater management plan, subject to review and approval by the
City. Grass infiltration areas or other approved alternative on-site stormwater
collection and treatment systems may be approved by the City during the
development review process;
      2.   All development subject to this title shall be carried out such that
the runoff of stormwater or other surface waters shall not be accelerated,
concentrated, or otherwise conveyed beyond the exterior property lines or
project boundaries except in compliance with the provisions of Best Management
Practices (BMPs) adopted pursuant to this title or as allowed through joint
management of stormwater with adjoining property owners pursuant to agreement
approved by the City. The quality of surface runoff shall be protected by
strict compliance with the design standards and BMPs adopted pursuant to this
title, or by implementation of measures shown by a qualified, licensed
professional, to have an effective design capability which exceeds the BMPs
adopted;
      3.   Each land owner developing real property subject to the terms of
this title shall develop a comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan which
addresses and complies with the requirements and standards established by this
section and the plan criteria, design standards and BMPs approved by a
qualified, licensed professional, who shall submit both construction-quality
design drawings and supporting calculations for review by the City prior to
start of construction. Each Stormwater Management Plan shall also identify
necessary maintenance requirements; and
      4.   Each developer who proposes and implements a stormwater management
system for collection of treatment of stormwater in accordance with this
section shall also establish, including assurance of adequate funding, the
necessary maintenance system including an acceptable plan for sustained
functioning of the collection and treatment system, and, when requested, grant
the necessary easements, to the local government which may choose to provide
continued maintenance of the system by public authorities or may require the
owner to accomplish the same. For purposes of application of the design
standard and other related documents and standards, the City of Priest River
shall be designated as the "permit authority".
   D.   Performance Standards: The following performance standards shall be
applicable to all design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of
stormwater management systems pursuant to the jurisdiction exercised through
this section:
      1.   There shall be no increase in the peak rate of runoff from this site
when compared with the dissipation of stormwater in the undeveloped state for a
25-year/24-hour storm based on the first one-half inch (1/2") of stormwater
runoff. Within project boundaries, sufficient retention capacity shall be
constructed to detain surface flow to meet the performance standard established
by this subsection D. For purposes of this section, "undeveloped state" shall
mean the natural soils and vegetation in place prior to the start of any
construction or clearing activity on a site;
      2.   No stormwater shall be collected or concentrated except within a
channel protected against erosion and containing energy dissipation measures to
prevent further erosion on adjoining lands. Existing unprotected channels shall
be protected against further erosion on adjoining lands. Any site development
or construction shall preserve installed components of a stormwater management
plan. All disturbed soils shall be protected during the course of construction
to prevent exposure to stormwater and to contain eroded materials should
contact be made; and
      3.   Any and all collected stormwater shall be directed to grass
infiltration areas (GIAs) which shall be established with grass and other
approved plant materials or to an acceptable stormwater management design. GIAs
or their acceptable alternatives shall be sized to hold and treat the first
one-half inch (1/2") of stormwater runoff from all impervious surfaces. The
overall stormwater disposal system shall have the capacity to handle a 25-year/
24-hour storm based upon the appropriate Idaho Transportation Department
intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve, without damage to the stormwater
management system or adjacent land and improvements.
   E.   Guarantee Of Installation: No final plat shall be recorded, nor shall
any building permits be issued until the stormwater management facilities are
in place and functioning as designed or until a guarantee of financial surety
is provided to and accepted by the City. No Certificate of Occupancy will be
issued until the stormwater management system has been installed and is
functioning as designed. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, project
occupancy can be achieved without harm to the environment or potential
occupants, occupancy may proceed upon receipt of an acceptable guarantee or
financial surety to complete installation when weather conditions or other
variables allow. In no case shall such guarantee be allowed if the incomplete
improvements would result in increased erosion, sedimentation, or other damage
to the development, public improvements, subsurface or surface waters, or the
proposed stormwater management system. At any time, the City is authorized to
stop work on the installation of subdivision improvements, to embargo further
issuance of building permits in a development, to stop work on any individual
building or development of any individual building site, or to otherwise take
steps necessary to protect the waters of the City from damage as a result of
development.
   F.   Prohibited Conduct: No person shall damage, harm, or fail to install or
complete, or otherwise impair the grass infiltration areas or any portion of a
stormwater management system installed pursuant to this section. Unless other
provisions are made in the process of development review and approval,
responsibility for maintenance of stormwater elements remains with the property
owner and violation of these maintenance requirements shall constitute a
violation of this section.
   G.   Variance: A variance from the requirements of this section or from the
design standards adopted pursuant to this section may be reviewed and/or
granted based on a determination of unique site characteristics. Variances may
only be granted in such circumstances if the approval of the variance would not
otherwise impair achievements of the standards or purpose of this section,
would not impose additional burden upon adjoining or downstream lands or
landowners, or otherwise disrupt the scheme of stormwater management in the
community. It shall be incumbent upon anyone requesting a variance to provide
data showing that alternative methods of stormwater handling proposed will
produce comparable efficacy of the stormwater management measures required by
this section. No variance shall be issued unless all elements of this
subsection are met. Any request for variance shall follow the procedures
outlined in section
10-13-1 of this title. (Ord. 597, 8-6-2018)

10-8-1: WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES; REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose And Definitions:
      1.   Purpose: Wireless communication facilities include antennas
(attached and freestanding) with or without equipment buildings constructed for
transmitting signals for the operation of personal communication systems. These
types of uses are necessary for the day-to-day function of everyday living and
commerce. Although necessary, these uses can have negative visual impacts to
the community. This section is intended to provide standards and a process for
permitting wireless communication facilities to assess and minimize negative
visual impacts.
      2.   Definitions:
      WIRELESS COMMUNICATION ANTENNA ARRAY: One or more rods, panels, discs, or
similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency (RF)
signals through electromagnetic energy, which may include omni-directional
antenna (whip), directional antenna (panel), and parabolic antenna (dish).
      WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FREESTANDING FACILITY: A wireless communication
transmission and/or reception device(s) that is affixed to a structure erected
to support the transmission and/or reception device equipment, equipment
structures, and connecting appurtenances. Support structure types include, but
are not limited to, metal poles, lattice towers, wood poles, and guy towers.
   B.   General Requirements:
      1.   A wireless communication facility shall constitute a special use and
shall be considered under the conditional use section of the Commercial and
Industrial Zoning Districts. Conditions that may be appropriate for wireless
communication facilities may include but are not limited to:

      4.   Communication antenna arrays may be located on an existing support
structure or building. Location of any antenna array on the existing facility
shall be permitted without a conditional use permit or a site plan review
contingent that there are no substantial changes to the existing support
structure. The antenna array shall not increase the height of said freestanding
facility or facility located on an existing building more than fifteen feet
(15'). Any antenna array that increases the height of the freestanding facility
more than fifteen feet (15') will require a conditional use permit.
      5.   Minor modifications of existing wireless communication facilities
are permitted, provided that; there are no significant changes in the visual
appearance of the facility. Minor modifications include, but are not limited
to, the addition of transmission and/or reception device(s) to wireless
communication facilities that meet the provisions of this section.
      6.   If any antenna or tower is not operated for a continuous period of
six (6) months, it shall be considered abandoned. The owner of such antenna or
tower shall remove it within sixty (60) days after notice and an opportunity to
be heard. If the antenna or tower is not removed within the sixty (60) days the
City may, at the expense of the communication facility's owner(s), remove the
antenna or tower and file a lien against the owner of the facility for expenses
incurred in removal and any attorney fees associated with the due process or
judicial process incurred by the City.
   C.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   Wireless communication facilities, whether constructed as a
permitted use or as a conditional use, shall be designed to be compatible with,
and blend with the natural and built environment. This design includes, but is
not limited to:

CHAPTER 11
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDs)
SECTION:
10-11-1: Planned Unit Development (PUD) Regulations
10-11-1: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) REGULATIONS:
   A.   Intent: The intent of the planned unit development (PUD) is to permit
building and development flexibility by permitting a PUD within any zoning
district through a rezone and/or conditional use permit or in those areas
designated as PUD on the City's official zoning map. Map designation of a PUD
still requires the processing of a conditional use permit for a PUD.
   B.   Goals: It shall be the policy to guide development of land and
construction by encouraging PUDs to achieve the following goals:
      1.   A choice of development environments by allowing a variety of
building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a reduction in
lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements, provided
appropriate amenities are provided by the development;
      2.   A more useful pattern of open space, more convenience in the
location of accessory commercial uses and services;
      3.   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and
prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
      4.   A more efficient use of land that is generally achieved through
shorter utilities and streets;
      5.   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation and community facilities objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
   C.   Conflicting Provisions: Whenever there is a conflict or difference
between the provisions of this section and those of other sections of this
Code, the provisions of this section shall prevail. Subjects not covered by
this section shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in
this title.
   D.   Density: The overall density of a PUD shall not exceed the provisions
of the underlying zone(s) except as provided in subsections J and P of this
section. Common open space and buffering may be included in calculation of the
overall density.
If a PUD is in more than one zoning district, the space and density
requirements shall be calculated separately for each zone. However, the
distribution of dwellings or other land uses within the PUD need not be
affected by the zoning district boundaries.
   E.   Uses Permitted:
      1.   A variety of residential, commercial, industrial, recreational or
combinations of these land uses may be permitted within a PUD. Residential
areas within PUDs may include both single-family and multi-family dwelling
units such as townhouses, garden apartments, common wall single-family and
multi-family dwellings, either as separately deeded lots, condominiums or as
lease or rental housing.
      2.   Zero lot line development and condominiums.
   F.   Ownership Requirements:
      1.   The PUD application shall be filed in the name or names and with the
consent of the recorded owner or owners of property included in the
development. An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a property
owner or a person having an existing interest in the property to be included in
the PUD. However, the application may be filed by the holder(s) of an equitable
interest in such property.
      2.   Before approval is granted to the final development plan, the entire
project shall be under single ownership or control and legal title must be
presented with the final development plan or approval may be granted subject to
this condition.
   G.   Common Open Space:
      1.   A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross land area developed in
any PUD project shall be reserved for common open space and/or recreational
facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. The
applicant/developer shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Council, the
proposed common area/open space is a percentage of the total area developed to
adequately serve the needs and impacts of the development.
      2.   The required amount of common open space land reserved under a PUD
shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area for
the use of each owner who buys property within the development and/or be
dedicated to the public and retained as common open space for parks, recreation
and related uses. Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way for
watercourses and other similar channels are not acceptable for common open
space dedication unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a trail or other
similar purpose and is approved by the City Council.
      3.   The responsibility for the maintenance and security of all open
spaces shall be specified by the developer before approval of the final
development plan. The City may require sufficient guarantees to insure such
maintenance and security.
      4.   Common open space shall meet the following standards:
         a.   The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space
shall be provided in a manner to meet the needs of the PUD.
         b.   The uses intended for the common open space must be appropriate
to the scale and character of the PUD, considering its size, density, expected
population, topography, and the number and type of structures and uses
provided.
         c.   Common open space should be suitably improved for its intended
use, although common open space containing natural features, existing trees,
and ground cover worthy of preservation may be proposed to be left unimproved.
The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in the common
open space shall be appropriate to the uses which are approved for the common
open space and shall conserve and enhance the amenities of the common open
space having regard to its topography and unimproved condition. The City may
use conditions of approval or require guarantees that insure required
improvements are constructed.
         d.   The development schedule must coordinate the improvement of the
common open space and the construction of all buildings and facilities within
the PUD.
         e.   The use and improvement of the common open space shall be planned
in relation to any existing public or semi-public open space which adjoins or
is within one thousand feet (1,000') of the perimeter of the PUD.
         f.   The form of ownership and maintenance of the open space must be
approved by the City prior to recording of the final PUD. The individual or
organization shall not dispose of the common open space without prior written
approval by the City Council.
   H.   Perimeter Requirements: If topographical or other barriers do not
provide adequate protection for existing or planned uses adjacent to the PUD,
the City may impose any or all of the following requirements:
      1.   Structures located within the perimeter of the PUD must be set back
by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent
existing uses.
      2.   Such structures located adjacent to the perimeter of the PUD must be
permanently screened or buffered in a manner approved by the City Council.
Screening/buffering includes but is not limited to: installation of berms;
fencing; landscaping or combination thereof.
      3.   Modification of perimeter requirements can be made when
accommodating subsection G4e of this section.
   I.   Underground Utilities: Underground utilities, including telephone and
electrical systems, are required within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this
requirement if the City Council finds that such exemption will not violate the
intent or character of the proposed PUD.
   J.   Increased Residential Density:
      1.   To provide for an incentive for quality PUDs, the City Council may
authorize an increased density in excess of that permitted in the applicable
Residential Zoning District. The increased density shall be negotiable.
Character, identity, architectural and site variation incorporated in a
development shall be considered cause for density increases, provided these
factors make a substantial contribution to the objectives of the PUD,
including:
         a.   Landscaping, streetscape, open spaces and plazas, use of existing
landscaping, pedestrian way treatment and recreational areas.
         b.   Siting, visual focal points, use of existing physical features
such as topography, view, sun and wind orientation, circulation pattern,
physical environment, variation in building setbacks and building grouping
(such as clustering).
         c.   Design features, street sections, architectural style, harmonious
use of materials, parking areas broken by landscaping features and varied use
of housing types.
         d.   Public and/or community services, such as water and sewer, are
appropriate for the proposed densities.
         e.   Unbuildable lands cannot be used in density calculations.
         f.   Increased density will not permit overcrowding.
   K.   Commercial And Industrial Uses:
      1.   When PUDs include commercial and industrial or both, uses, the
buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups having common parking
areas and common ingress and egress points in order to limit the number of
encroachments and intersections. Planting screens or fences must be provided on
the perimeter of the commercial/industrial areas abutting residential
development or zone districts.
      2.   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and
facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial areas.
      3.   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise
maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
      4.   Access roads shall not have a substantial adverse effect on
properties adjoining the access roads.
   L.   Application Procedure:
      1.   Approval Procedure: The granting of a conditional use permit for a
PUD shall require a pre-application, the submission of a preliminary
development plan and approval by the City Council of a final development plan
as specified within this title.
      2.   Pre-Application Meeting: The developer shall meet with the

Council, in which interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard
shall be held. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, notice of the
time and place and a summary of the proposal shall be published in the official
newspaper of the City. Notice by mail shall be given by mailing of the public
notice fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing to property owners within three
hundred feet (300') beyond the external boundaries of the land to be
considered, excluding streets and alleys, and any additional area that may be
substantially impacted by the proposed special use as determined by the
Administrator, using the last known name and address of such owners on the
latest adopted tax roll of the County. The applicant shall bear the
responsibility and costs of public notice by mail and by publication. The City
shall have the responsibility of preparing the public notice for the applicant,
and the applicant shall supply self-addressed stamped envelopes of all property

         a.   Review For Approval - City Council: Within thirty (30) days after
the public hearing the City Council shall review the preliminary development
plan to determine if it is consistent with the intent and purpose of this
chapter; whether the proposed development advances the general welfare of the
community and neighborhood and whether the benefits, combination of various
land uses and the interrelationship with the land uses in the surrounding area
justify the deviation from standard district regulations. The City Council's
approval in principle of the preliminary development plan shall be necessary
before an applicant may submit a final development plan. Approval in principle
shall not be construed to endorse a precise location of uses, configuration of
parcels or engineering feasibility.
         b.   Consideration Of General Standards: The City Council shall
consider the general standards applicable to conditional use permits and
criteria for special uses before approving in principle a preliminary
development plan.
         c.   Costs And Fees: The City Council shall not decide on a
preliminary plan unless permitting costs and fees, that are the responsibility
of the applicant/developer, have been paid.
         d.   Signed Agreement: All PUDs and conditional use permits, as a
condition of approval, must have a signed agreement in place for development,
sustained use, or any other special agreement as required by the City. The
agreement is only valid for the proposal as presented for approval. Any changes
to the project scope must have a new negotiated and signed agreement.
      6.   Final Plan - Filing: An application for approval of the final
development plan must be filed within two (2) years of approval of a
preliminary development plan. The final plan shall be filed with the
Administrator by at least one property owner or person having a presently
existing interest in the property for which the PUD is proposed. Applications
shall be signed by the owner, attesting to the truth and exactness of all
information supplied on the application for final development plan. Each
application shall clearly state that the approval shall expire and may be
revoked if construction on the project has not begun within two (2) years from
the date of issuance of the approval unless specifically allowed otherwise by
the City Council. At a minimum, the application for a final plan shall contain
the following information:

      7.   Final Plan - City Council Recommendation:
         a.   Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the final development
plan, the Administrator shall recommend that the final development plan be
approved as presented, approved with supplementary conditions or disapproved.
The Administrator may, upon showing cause, request and receive time extensions
from the City Council. The Administrator shall then transmit all papers
constituting the record and the recommendations to the City Council.
         b.   The City Council shall find that the facts submitted with the
application and presented to them establish that:
            (1)   The proposed development can be initiated within two (2)
years of the date of approval or as otherwise stipulated by the City Council;
            (2)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which would not be achieved under standard district
regulations;
            (3)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and
adequate to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not
generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the
PUD;
            (4)   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed;
            (5)   Any exception from standard district requirements is
warranted by the design and other amenities incorporated in the final
development plan and is in accordance with the PUD and the adopted policy of
the City Council;
            (6)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and
zoned in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed
development;
            (7)   The PUD is in general conformance with the Comprehensive
Plan;
            (8)   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for
the population densities and nonresidential uses proposed; and
            (9)   Permitting costs, that are the responsibility of the
applicant/developer, have been paid by the applicant/developer.
      8.   Final Plan - City Council Action:
         a.   Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the final recommendation
of the Administrator, the City Council shall agendize the application to a
meeting to approve, approve with supplementary conditions or disapprove the
application as presented. Upon granting or denying the application the City
Council shall specify:
            (1)   The code and standards used in evaluating the application;
            (2)   The reasons for approval or denial; and
            (3)   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain
a permit.
         b.   Prior to an approval of a final plan, the City may require the
applicant/developer enter into a Development Agreement with the City setting
forth: the scope of the project; conditions of development; and describing all
improvements and amenities which the applicant/developer has agreed to
construct.
         c.   If the application is either approved or approved with
conditions, the City Council shall direct the Administrator to issue zoning
permits only in accordance with the approved final development plan and the
supplementary conditions attached thereto.
      9.   Extensions: Extensions for final plan filing of up to six (6) months
and/or initiation of construction of a project of up to two (2) years may be
granted by the Administrator, upon the applicant/developer showing cause for an
extension.
   M.   Planned Unit Development Review Criteria: A PUD may be approved only if
the proposal conforms to the following criteria to the satisfaction of the City
Council:
      1.   The proposal produces a functional, enduring and desirable
environment;
      2.   The proposal is consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan and this
title;
      3.   The design and site planning is compatible with existing uses on
adjacent properties. Design elements to be considered include but are not
limited to density, architectural style, placement of buildings upon land,
building heights and bulk, off-street parking, open space, privacy, and
landscaping;
      4.   The proposal is compatible with natural features of the site and
adjoining properties. Natural features to be considered include: topography,
native vegetation not restricted by law, wildlife habitats, watercourse,
floodplains, floodways and view corridors;
      5.   The location, design, and size of the proposal are such that the
development will be adequately served by existing public facilities or
services. Addition to, or expansion of, existing facilities or the creation of
new facilities may be required as a condition of PUD approval. Additions and
expansions shall be the responsibility of the developer;
      6.   The proposal provides adequate private common open space area, as
determined by the City Council, of no less than ten percent (10%) of gross land
area, free of buildings, streets, driveways or parking area. The common open
space shall be accessible to all users of the development and usable for open
space and recreational purposes;
      7.   Off-street parking provides parking sufficient for users of the
development and shall be integrated into the development to minimize exposure
and impact;
      8.   The proposal indicates the form of management, acceptable to the
City, for the perpetual maintenance and security of all common property;

approval of PUDs, and when the need is caused by the PUD, require mitigation of
impacts to the extent required by the PUD to public services and facilities
including but not limited to: schools, parks, playgrounds and associated
services. Areas for such services may be set aside and negotiated for public
use or be permanently reserved for the owners, residents, employees, or patrons
of the development.
   P.   Modification Of Development Standards: In order to achieve the purposes
of these provisions, the following standards may be modified with conditions
imposed:
      1.   Any provision pertaining to site performance standards including,
but not limited to, height, bulk, setback or maximum dimensions of any
facility;

   Q.   Security For Improvements: The City Council may, as a condition of
approval of a final PUD, require the applicant to enter into a contract with
the City to install the required public improvements. The applicant shall
furnish an irrevocable letter of credit, performance bond or other sufficient
security acceptable to the City for the installation and associated costs.
However, if an applicant/developer completes all public improvements prior to
lease, sale or use of properties, bonding will not be required. The
Administrator may extend the completion date for additional six (6) month
periods upon written request from the applicant showing cause and need for the
extension.
In the event the developer fails to complete such work within the period of
time as required by the conditions of the guarantee for the completion of
public improvements, the guarantee shall be forfeited to the City. The City
shall arrange to have such work completed up to the amount of the guarantee. In
no case shall the City be required to expend any funds other than those
provided by the guarantee. In order to accomplish this, the City shall
reimburse itself for any cost and expense thereof by appropriating the
guarantee.
   R.   Parties Bound: Once the preliminary development plan is approved, all
persons and parties, their successors, heirs, or assigns, who own, have, or
will have by virtue of purchase, inheritance or assignment, any interest in the
real property within the proposed PUD, shall be bound by the conditions
attending the approval of the development and the provisions of this title.
   S.   Administration And Enforcement: Building permits and other permits
required for the construction or development of property under the provisions
of this section shall be issued only when in the opinion of the Administrator,
the work to be performed meets the requirements of the final plan and program
elements of the PUD. Any determination made by the Administrator, regarding
administering this section, can be appealed to the City Council.
   T.   Minor And Major Changes:
      1.   Minor adjustments may be made and approved by the Administrator when
a building permit is issued. Minor adjustments are those which may affect the
precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic
character or arrangement of buildings of the approved final plan, nor the
density of the development or the open space requirements. Such dimensional
adjustments shall not vary more than ten percent (10%) from the original.
      2.   Major adjustments are those which, in the opinion of the
Administrator, substantially change the basic design, density, open space or
other requirements of the PUD. When, in the opinion of the Administrator, a
change constitutes a major adjustment, no building or other permit shall be
issued without prior review and approval by the City Council of such
adjustment.
   U.   Fees: It is the intent of the City for the applicant/developer to
assume all permitting costs associated with processing a PUD. Permitting costs
shall include processing fees, postage and reasonable professional fees such as
engineering and legal service fees. The City may set such fees by resolution.

CHAPTER 14
NONCONFORMING USES
SECTION:
10-14-1: Nonconforming Uses; Regulations
10-14-1: NONCONFORMING USES; REGULATIONS:
   A.   Intent: Nonconforming uses are declared by this title to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which such use is located.
It is the intent of this title to permit nonconforming uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent
of this title that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district. A destroyed residential structure may be
approved, upon City Council consideration, for reconstruction upon the same
footprint. Any change to the structure size, height, or placement shall be
subject to the conditional use process.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   The lawful use of land or structures existing on the effective date
of this title may be continued. With approval of the Administrator,
nonconforming uses or structures may be altered or expanded. The extension of a
nonconforming use to a portion of a structure which was arranged or designed
for the nonconforming use at the time this title becomes effective is not an
expansion of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming structure which conforms with
respect to use may be altered or expanded if the alteration or expansion does
not cause the structure to deviate further from the standards of this title.
      2.   If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months, further use of the property shall conform to this title.
      3.   A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not be
changed back to a nonconforming use, unless approved through the conditional
use process.
      4.   A nonconforming use may be changed with the approval of the
Administrator to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restrictive
nature.
      5.   Nothing contained in this regulation shall require any change in the
plans, construction, alteration or designated use of a structure upon which
construction has commenced prior to the adoption date of this title. If the
designated use will be nonconforming, it shall be in operation within two (2)
years of the effective date of this title; otherwise, future use of the
property shall be in conformance with the zoning district in which the property
is located.
      6.   Normal repairs and alterations may be made to a lawful nonconforming
building, provided that no structural alterations shall be made, except those
required by law. No existing nonconforming structure designed, arranged,
intended for, or devoted to, a use not permitted under this title for the
district in which the structure is located shall be enlarged, extended,
structurally altered, or moved unless the use is changed to a use permitted
under the regulations specified by this title for the district in which the
building is located; and provided that nothing in this title shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or
part thereof declared to be unsafe and ordered to be strengthened or restored
to a safe condition, unless the building has been destroyed by an extent
exceeding seventy five percent (75%) of full value, as determined by
consideration of the assessed value referred to below.
      7.   When a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is
damaged by fire or by any other cause so that the cost of renewal of the
damaged parts exceeds seventy five percent (75%) of the cost of the replacement
of the entire building (exclusive of foundations) using new materials, then the
building, unless expressly approved by the City Council, shall not be rebuilt
unless the building and its construction and uses conform fully to this title
and other codes of the City as applied to new buildings and structures and to
uses for the district in which it is located. The determination of whether a
building is destroyed to the extent described above shall rest with the
Administrator.
   C.   Schedule Of Continuance - Nonconforming "Open Land Uses": The
alternative provided to meet compliance with nonconforming "open land uses" is:
All uses of land for outdoor work or storage purposes, which after the adoption
of this title or amendments thereto, exist as a nonconforming use, shall be
completely enclosed within a view-obscuring fence, approved by the City
Council, within two (2) years, the fence shall be of a sufficient height so
that the fence and supplemental landscaping will at all seasons of the year
completely screen all operations of such establishments from view from adjacent
land and buildings. (Ord. 597, 8-6-2018)

FLOOD CONTROL REGULATIONS
CHAPTER 1
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
12-1-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose, And Methods
12-1-2: Definitions
12-1-3: General Provisions
12-1-4: Administration
12-1-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
12-1-6: Fees
12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Idaho, in
section 46-1020 through 46-1024 Idaho Code, authorized local governmental units
to adopt a floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies
floodplain areas and that sets forth minimum development requirements in
floodplains that are designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Priest River, Idaho does
ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the city of Priest River are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
      1.   To protect human life and health;
      2.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
      3.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      6.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      7.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      1.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      2.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      4.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      5.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 529, 11-2-2009)
12-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted, so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to

square feet, such as detached two (2) car garages, boathouses, small pole barns
and storage sheds, designed not to be used for human habitation. Accessory
structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; shall be anchored to prevent
flotation which may result in damage to other structures; service utilities
such as electrical and heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the interpretation of any provision of this
chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet (3'); a
clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as
sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "100-year flood".
Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRAWL SPACE: An enclosed area subgrade or below the flood protection elevation
and as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing
for the automatic entry and exits of floodwaters.
CRITICAL FACILITY: A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might
be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools,
nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations,
installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous
waste.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its
lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, post, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The official form FEMA (form 81-3-1) uses to track
development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with
community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance
premium rate with section B completed by community officials.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the adopted floodplain management regulations.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special flood
hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary floodway
map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION: An elevation that shall correspond to the elevation
of the one percent (1%) chance flood (100-year flood) plus any increased flood
elevation due to floodway encroachment, plus any required freeboard. The flood
protection elevation (FPE) in the city is defined in "The Flood Insurance Study
For The Bonner County, Idaho And Incorporated Areas" (FIS) effective November
18, 2009, as base flood elevation (BFE), base flood elevation with floodway or
as otherwise indicated on the FIS or on the panel directly referenced for the
specific area of development. In AO zones the FPE is determined as an elevation
of two feet (2') above adjacent grade.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height (less than 1 foot).
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement
and crawl space). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at subsection
12-1-5B1b of this chapter. For crawl space exception see FEMA technical
bulletin 11-01.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOOD: A flood determined to be representative of large floods known
to have occurred in Idaho and which may be expected to occur on a particular
stream because of like physical characteristics. The regulatory flood is based
upon a statistical analysis of stream flow records available for the watershed
or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the watershed. In
inland areas, the flood frequency of the regulatory flood is once in every one
hundred (100) years; this means that in any given year there is a one percent
(1%) chance that a regulatory flood may occur or be exceeded.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before damage occurred.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or a state inventory of historic places.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
WATER DEPENDENT: A structure for commerce or industry which cannot exist in any
other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature
of its operations. (Ord. 529, 11-2-2009)
12-1-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Priest
River.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study For The
Bonner County, Idaho And Incorporated Areas" dated November 18, 2009, with
accompanying flood insurance maps, are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the
office of the city clerk, Priest River city hall, Priest River, Idaho. The best
available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in
subsection
12-1-4C2 of this chapter shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is
issued which incorporates the data utilized under subsection
12-1-4C2 of this chapter.
   C.   Penalties For Noncompliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of
the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall
upon conviction thereof be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both, for each violation,
and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the city of Priest River from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   D.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   E.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city of Priest River, any officer, agent or employee thereof, or the
federal emergency management agency, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. (Ord. 529, 11-2-2009)
12-1-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Establishment Of Development Permit:
      1.   Development Permit Required: A development permit shall be obtained
before construction or development begins within any area of special flood
hazard established in subsection 12-1-3B of this chapter. The permit shall be
for all structures including manufactured homes, as set forth in section
12-1-2, "Definitions", of this chapter, and for all development including fill
and other activities, also as set forth in section
12-1-2, "Definitions", of this chapter.
      2.   Application For Development Permit: Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city of Priest River and may
include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the
nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing
or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and
the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is
required:
         a.   Elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (as
defined) of all structures;
         b.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure
has been floodproofed;
         c.   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in subsection 12-1-5B2 of this chapter; and
         d.   Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   B.   Designation Of The Floodplain Administrator: The planning and zoning
administrator is hereby appointed to be the floodplain administrator and to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit
applications in accordance with its provisions.
   C.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: Duties of
the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Permit Review:
         a.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         b.   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.
         c.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development will increase base flood elevations more than one foot (1'). If
base flood elevations increase more than one foot (1'), require a FEMA
conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) before construction begins and
letter of map revision (LOMR) for as built conditions.
         d.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of subsection 12-1-5D1 of this chapter are met.
            (1)   If a floodway encroachment is permitted that increases base
flood elevations, require a FEMA conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)
before construction begins and letter of map revision (LOMR) for as built
conditions.
      2.   Use Of Other Base Flood Data (In A Zones): When flood protection
elevation data has not been provided (A zones) in accordance with section
12-1-3, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter, the planning and zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, in order to establish a flood protection
elevation and administer subsections
12-1-5B, "Specific Standards", and
12-1-5D, "Floodways", of this chapter.
      3.   Information To Be Obtained And Maintained:
         a.   Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood
insurance study, FIRM, or as required in subsection C2 of this section, obtain
and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
floor (as defined) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether
or not the structure contains a basement.
         b.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures
where flood protection elevation data is provided through the flood insurance
study, FIRM, or as required in subsection C2 of this section:
            (1)   Obtain, verify and record the actual elevation (in relation
to mean sea level), and
            (2)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection A2c of this section.
         c.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      4.   Alteration Of Watercourses:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the department of water resources
and development prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management
agency.
         b.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is
not diminished.
      5.   Interpretation Of FIRM Boundaries: Make interpretations where
needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in subsection D of this section.
   D.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   Variance:
         a.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the city clerk
on the form provided by the city of Priest River, and include at minimum the
same information required for a development permit and an explanation for the
basis for the variance request.
         b.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, as
determined by the administrator, the variance request will be set for public
hearing at the next city council meeting in which time is available and for the
matter to be appropriately noticed and heard.
         c.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be
published in the official newspaper of the city at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the hearing. In addition to the newspaper publication, written notice
shall be provided to all adjoining property owners. A legal description of the
subject property and mailing labels for the adjoining properties prepared by an
Idaho licensed title company shall be provided by the applicant as part of the
complete application information referenced in subsection D1b of this section.
         d.   The burden to show that the property meets the criteria for a
variance is on the applicant.
         e.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection D1d of this
section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
         f.   The city shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request.
      2.   Criteria For Variances:
         a.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         b.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         c.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         d.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            (1)   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            (3)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances.
         e.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
         f.   Variances should be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances.
      3.   Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance shall be
in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and denial. If the
variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice along with the
written decision that the permitted building will have its lowest floor below
the flood protection elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will likely
be commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
   E.   Appeals: The city council shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the administrator.
      1.   Filing An Appeal: An appeal must be filed with the city clerk within
fourteen (14) days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the
administrator. Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure
to exhaust the administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the
interpretation of the administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts
relied upon by the appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in
the interpretation.
      2.   Consideration Of An Appeal: Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the
appeal will be scheduled for the next available city council meeting to be
heard. The city council shall consider the following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, including:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            (11)   The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      3.   Decision: The city council decision on an appeal shall be in writing
and set out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the
decision. (Ord. 529, 11-2-2009)
12-1-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following
standards are required:
      1.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
      2.   AH Zone Drainage: Adequate drainage paths are required around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      3.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
      4.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         b.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
         c.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      5.   Subdivision Proposals:
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         b.   All subdivision proposals shall have utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage;
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
         d.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less).
      6.   Review Of Building Permits: Where flood protection elevation data is
not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another
authoritative source (subsection 12-1-4C2 of this chapter), applications for
building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be
reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment
and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past
flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet (2')
above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards where flood
protection elevation data has been provided as set forth in section
12-1-2, "Definitions", and subsection 12-1-3B, "Basis For Establishing The
Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", or subsection 12-1-4C2, "Use Of Other Base
Flood Data (In A Zones)" of this chapter, the following provisions are
required:
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at or above
the flood protection elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
            (4)   Below grade crawl spaces are prohibited at sites where the
velocity of floodwaters exceeds five feet (5') per second.
            (5)   All building utility systems within the crawl space shall be
elevated above flood protection elevation or be designed so that floodwaters
cannot enter or accumulate within the system component during flood conditions.
            (6)   The interior of a crawl space below the flood protection
elevation must not be more than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent
exterior grade (LAG) and the height of the below grade crawl space, measured
from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space
foundation must not exceed four feet (4') at any point.
            (7)   Below grade crawl spaces constructed in accordance with the
requirements listed in this subsection shall not be considered basements.
However, applicants who construct buildings that have below grade crawl spaces
are hereby advised that such buildings will have higher flood insurance
premiums than buildings that have crawl spaces with interior elevations at or
above the lowest adjacent grade.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at or above
the flood protection elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in
subsection
12-1-4C3b of this chapter;
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection B1b of this section;
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the base
flood level will be rated as 1 foot below).
      3.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites:
            (1)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
            (2)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
            (3)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or
            (4)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated at or above the flood protection elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
         b.   Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones AH and
AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home
provisions must be elevated so that either:
            (1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at or
above the flood protection elevation, or
            (2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no
less than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely
anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      4.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles placed on sites are
required to either:
         a.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
         b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or
         c.   Meet the requirements of subsection B3 of this section and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.
   C.   Before Regulatory Floodway: In areas where a regulatory floodway has
not been designated: No new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within the AE zone on the
community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
   D.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection 12-1-3B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   If subsection D1 of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
   E.   Standards For Shallow Flooding Areas (AO Zones): Shallow flooding areas
appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in
these zones range from one to three feet (3') aboveground where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized
as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:
      1.   New construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building,
one foot (1') or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least 2
feet above highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified).
      2.   New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures within AO zones shall either:
         a.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot (1') or more above the
depth number specified on the FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is
specified); or
         b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that
level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is
used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as in subsection B2c of this section.
      3.   Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
      4.   Critical facilities shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated three feet (3') above the depth specified on the FIRM or at least five
feet (5') above highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
   F.   Critical Facility: Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to
the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard
area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated three feet (3') above the base flood elevation or to the
height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the
critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the flood protection elevation shall be
provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 529, 11-2-
2009)
12-1-6: FEES:
The city council is authorized to establish permit fees which provide for the
reimbursement of costs incurred by the city in the administration of this
chapter. Such costs include, but are not limited to, those associated with the
processing and professional review of the permitting and proposed development
as identified in this chapter. The city council is hereby authorized to
establish said fees by resolution. (Ord. 529, 11-2-2009)
