final judgments against any retained liability risk, other uninsured losses and

liability risk and other potential loss against retained risk. It shall be the

It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate children group treatment centers
in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens,
and their children, of the city of Pocatello, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent unsafe fire and health conditions for the
children who are receiving group behavioral/mental health/developmental
disability treatment within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
lawful type or manner of counseling children may receive in these centers.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by the parents, or their children, to properly licensed behavioral/
mental health/developmental disability treatment. (Ord. 2811, 2007)

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
   CHILDREN GROUP TREATMENT CENTERS: Any establishment which provides mental
health or developmental disability treatment or services to groups of three (3)
or more children two and one-half (21/2) to twelve (12) years of age in the
group treatment center when the treatment or services exceeds ninety (90)
minutes in length during one 24-hour period, and the child's parent or guardian
is not on site, shall be considered a children group treatment center and
licensed under this chapter. Services delivered outside of the center are not
subject to the regulations of this chapter.
   PREMISES: Includes the group treatment center structure as well as any
accessory outdoor exercise or play areas. Provided, however, that for purposes
of staffing regulations set out in this chapter, "premises" shall be more
narrowly construed so as to mean that portion of the group treatment center,
whether indoors or outdoors, where the group treatment is provided to the
children during any given portion of the day.
   STAFF: Any person hired to assist with the care of children or who could
possibly be alone with the children. This includes persons providing
transportation, cooking or serving meals, cleaning or maintenance,
nonprofessional supervision and general office staff.
   TREATMENT CENTER: The place, building, location, or portion thereof, wherein
children are provided group mental health or developmental disabilities
treatment under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2811, 2007)
5.30.030: APPLICABILITY:
The regulations set out in this chapter shall apply to all facilities and
persons entering into or engaged in the business of providing mental health or
developmental disabilities treatment or services to groups of three (3) or more
children two and one-half (21/2) to twelve (12) years of age in the group
treatment center within the limits of the city of Pocatello. Any establishment
which engages in the business of children group treatment or services, as
defined in this chapter, must have a separate business license under the

5.60.010: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city of Pocatello, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration
of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   B.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available
to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215
(1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v.
Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to, Cleburne, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Garden
Grove, California; Adams County, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Phoenix,
Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Las Vegas, Nevada; and
Cleveland, Ohio, the city council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for some of the activities that occur on
their premises.
      2.   Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department has revealed
that employees of some sexually oriented businesses currently in operation in
the city of Pocatello are unable to observe the activities of their customers
at all times, thereby increasing the likelihood of ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities on their premises. In one establishment, the investigation
revealed holes cut into the partition separating private booths to allow for
anonymous genital contact. The doors to these private booths lock from the
inside which reinforces the ability to become involved in anonymous illicit
sexual activity.
      3.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined herein as
adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of
illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      4.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      5.   Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department found
private booths in two (2) sexually oriented businesses in the city of
Pocatello, where there is reason to believe that sexual activity including, but
not necessarily limited to, masturbation, is taking place within private booths
in one of those establishments.
      6.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      7.   Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      8.   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis,
salmonella infections and shigella infections.
      9.   Since 1981, and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States - 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 733,374 through December 31, 1999.
      10.   As of June 2000, there have been 488 reported cases of AIDS and 353
more reported cases of HIV infection in the state of Idaho.
      11.   Since 1981, and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in the
state of Idaho.
      12.   The number of cases of genital chlamydia in the United States
reported annually has risen, with 526,653 cases reported as of 1997, making
chlamydia the most reported of all notifiable infectious diseases in the United
States.
      13.   While the number of cases of syphilis and gonorrhea has declined,
the number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains
at a high level, with over 325,000 cases being reported in 1997, which
indicates that the annual decreases in reported cases of gonorrhea may be
leveling off.
      14.   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      15.   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
      16.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      17.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
      18.   Recent investigation by the Pocatello police department found
potentially unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, as well as the presence of
semen in an adult film viewing booth in an existing sexually oriented business
in the city of Pocatello, Idaho.
      19.   The findings noted in subsections A1 through A18 of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      20.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      21.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      22.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually
oriented businesses.
      23.   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      24.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      25.   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      26.   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      27.   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      28.   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 2660 § 1,
2000)

license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the sexually
oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business
employee and will expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the aggrieved
party's action to appeal, challenge, restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's

For the purposes of this chapter the following terms, phrases, and words shall

reasonably cause the public to believe that the sale will offer goods damaged
or altered by fire, smoke, water or other like causes or means.
   GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE: A sale held out in such a manner as to
reasonably cause the public to believe that upon disposal of the stock of goods
on hand the business will cease and be discontinued. Included in this
definition, but not limited thereto, are the following kinds of sales:
adjustor's, adjustment, alteration, administrator's, assignee's, bankruptcy,
benefit of administrator or executor, benefit of creditors, benefit of
trustees, building coming down, closing, creditor's committee, creditors, end,

   PERSON: An individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company
or organization of any kind.
   REMOVAL OF BUSINESS OR CLOSING OUT SALE: A sale held out in such a manner as
to reasonably cause the public to believe that the person conducting the sale
will discontinue business at the place of sale upon disposal of the stock of
goods on hand and will then move to and resume business at a new location or
from other existing locations; provided, however, that any sale closing out one
or more lines of goods or brands or types of goods not held out to be a
cessation of business in one location shall not be deemed a removal of business
or closing out sale.

public to believe that upon disposal of the stock of goods on hand, the person
conducting the sale will cease operating any business, and that his business
operation will cease and be discontinued, not to reopen at this or any other
location. Provided, however, that a sale whose purpose is to commemorate or
celebrate the retirement of a long term owner or employee as a short term
special event, lasting no longer than thirty (30) days, provided that the
advertising clearly indicates that the business will not close after the sale,
shall not be considered a "retirement sale" and shall be exempt from the

with the permitted sale.

unless the goods were part of the inventory of the business at least thirty
(30) days prior to application for the permit. For purposes of this chapter,

following:
      1.   Persons acting pursuant to an order or process of a court of

6.04.050: DANGEROUS CONDUCT BY ANIMALS PROHIBITED; PENALTIES:
   A.   Dangerous Conduct By Animal Prohibited: The owner or custodian of any
animal which commits any of the acts defined in this chapter as "dangerous" may
be cited for a misdemeanor and the Animal Services Department may seize and
impound the animal until the matter has been adjudicated. The conduct shall not
be deemed dangerous if the victim (person, domestic animal, or livestock) was
committing a tort against the animal's owner/custodian, or committing a
trespass or other tort on the premises of the animal's owner/custodian.
Specifically prohibited are the following acts:
      1.   If unprovoked by teasing, taunting, or a threatening manner by any
person, approaching said person in an apparent attitude of attack upon the
streets, sidewalks, public grounds or places, common areas within subdivisions
or mobile home or recreational vehicle parks, common grounds of apartment
buildings, condominiums, or townhouse developments, or private property not
solely owned or possessed by the owner or custodian of the animal; or
      2.   Biting, inflicting injury, assaulting, or otherwise attacking a
human being or domestic animal or livestock without justifiable provocation.
   B.   Prohibited Animals: No person may own or harbor or have custodial care
of any of the following types of vicious animals:
      1.   Any animal with a known propensity, tendency, or disposition to
attack unprovoked, to cause injury, or to otherwise endanger the safety of
human beings or domestic animals or livestock, unless restrained and/or
confined as provided in section
6.04.060 of this chapter; or
      2.   Any animal which is used primarily or in part for the purpose of
fighting, or any animal trained for fighting; or
      3.   Any dog which has been trained as an attack dog, except dogs used by
law enforcement agencies.
   C.   Impoundment And/Or Destruction: Any animal whose owner or custodian has
been found guilty of or entered a plea of guilty to the offense of dangerous
conduct by his/her animal is subject to impoundment and destruction. For a
first offense, the court shall set the matter for sentencing and notify the
Office of the City Attorney (prosecutor) of the date, time, and place of
sentencing. The prosecutor may request that the court order the destruction of
the animal. If the court determines that destruction is warranted, it shall
issue an order authorizing any animal services officer or police officer to
enter the property where the animal is located and to seize the animal and
impound it for destruction if the animal has not been voluntarily surrendered
by five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the date of sentencing.
   D.   Subsequent Violations:
      1.   Upon the conviction or plea of guilty to a second or subsequent
offense of dangerous animal conduct, regardless of the form of the current or
any prior judgment, if the subsequent conduct involved the animal being
dangerous, the court shall order destruction of the animal. If the court
determines that destruction is warranted, it shall issue an order authorizing
any animal services officer or police officer to enter the property where the
animal is located and seize the animal and impound it for destruction if the
animal has not been voluntarily surrendered by five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the
date of sentencing.
      2.   If the subsequent conduct did not involve the animal being
dangerous, the court may, but is not required to, order destruction of the
animal regardless of the form of the current or prior judgment.
   E.   Owner Liability: An adult owner/custodian of a dangerous animal shall
be liable for all injuries and property damage sustained by any person or by
any animal caused by an unprovoked attack by any dangerous animal, plus all
costs, civil judgments or penalties, criminal fines, final terms, veterinary
fees, shelter impound fees, and any other penalties and orders. In the event
that the owner/custodian of the dangerous animal is a minor, the minor's parent
or guardian shall be so liable.
   F.   Failure To Surrender Animal: It shall be a separate offense to fail to
surrender an animal for impoundment and/or destruction. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord.
2884, 2010: Ord. 2838 § 2, 2008: Ord. 2764 § 3, 2005: Ord. 2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.060: RESTRAINT AND CARE OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS:
   A.   Restraint Requirements: The owner/custodian of any animal convicted of
a violation of the dangerous conduct prohibitions set out in this chapter shall
complete the requirements of this subsection and subsection B of this section
within thirty (30) days of the date of such conviction. Every dangerous animal
shall be securely confined by its owner/custodian within a building or secure
enclosure as set out herein, and whenever off the premises of its owner/
custodian, shall be either caged or securely muzzled and restrained by an adult
with a chain or tether having a minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300)
pounds and not more than three feet (3') in length, and shall be under the
direct control and supervision of the adult owner/custodian of the dangerous
animal. Every person harboring a dangerous animal is charged with an
affirmative duty to confine the animal in such a way that persons and other
animals do not have access to such animal. To be considered secure, a facility
must be constructed in a manner capable of containing the animal. It shall be a
completed structure with a securely attached roof of durable material which is
secured to a foundation or concrete pad, or it shall be a chainlink structure
which includes a securely attached roof, and which is embedded into the ground
to a depth of no less than one foot (1'). Both the completed structure and the
chainlink structure shall be at least six feet (6') in height and shall include
a locking mechanism which shall be kept locked at all times the animal is
within said facility.
   B.   Signage: The owner/custodian of a dangerous animal shall display in a
prominent place on the premises a clearly visible warning sign indicating that
there is a dangerous animal on the premises, with lettering large enough to be
read from the adjacent public right of way. A second warning sign must be
posted on the facility in which the animal is kept.
   C.   Compliance Enforcement Authority: Animal services officers are
empowered to make whatever inquiry is necessary to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, and may seize and impound any dangerous animal
whose owner fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Microchip Implantation And Alteration Required: Any person who has been
found guilty of or pled guilty to a violation of the dangerous conduct
prohibitions set out above shall, within five (5) days of conviction, have a
microchip implanted in the animal by a licensed veterinarian or the animal
services department, pay all associated costs, and, for work performed by a
veterinarian, provide proof to the animal services department that the
microchip has been implanted. In addition, the owner or custodian shall have
the animal spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian and shall provide
proof to the animal services department of such alteration within thirty (30)
days of the conviction.
   E.   Notification To Animal Services: The owner/custodian of a dangerous
animal shall notify the animal services department within twenty four (24)
hours if said dangerous animal is at large, is unconfined, has attacked another
animal or a human being, has temporarily or permanently relocated to another
address, or has died, been sold or given away. If the dangerous animal has been
sold or given away, the owner/custodian shall also provide the animal services
department with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner/
custodian of the dangerous animal, within twenty four (24) hours.
   F.   Impoundment: If a dangerous animal whose owner or custodian has
previously been found guilty of or pled guilty to a violation of the dangerous
conduct prohibitions in this chapter, regardless of the form of the prior or
current judgment(s), is alleged to have committed a subsequent violation of
section
 6.04.050 or
6.04.040 of this chapter or this section, or is found to be at large, the
animal services department shall seize and impound the animal until the matter
has been adjudicated. The owner/custodian of the animal shall be responsible
for all cost of impound fees, medical care, and other expenses for said animal
while it is in custody with the Pocatello Animal Shelter, and the owner/
custodian shall pay all such impound fees, medical care, and other expenses
within five (5) days of the sentencing, or animal services may dispose of the
animal, including, but not limited to, adoption or destruction, without further
notice to the owner/custodian.
   G.   Dangerous Animal Registry: The owner of any animal found to be
dangerous, by a court of law, shall within forty five (45) days of such
finding, obtain a dangerous animal registration certificate from the animal
services department for a fee, as set forth in the city's annual fee resolution
adopted by the city council, in addition to other fees that may be authorized
by law. The animal services department shall also provide the owner with a
uniformly designed tag that identifies the animal as dangerous. The owner shall
affix the tag to the animal's collar and ensure that the animal wears the
collar and tag at all times. By January 31 of each year, until such time as the
dangerous animal is deceased, all certificates obtained pursuant to this
subsection shall be updated and renewed for a fee, as set forth in the city's
annual fee resolution adopted by the city council, and in the same manner as
the initial certificate was obtained. The animal services department shall post
registration information on the city of Pocatello dangerous animal registry.
   H.   Dangerous Animal Registration Certificates: All dangerous animal
registration certificates or renewals thereof required to be obtained under
this subsection shall only be issued to persons eighteen (18) years of age or
older who present satisfactory evidence: 1) of the animal's current rabies
vaccination, if applicable; 2) that the animal has been neutered or spayed; and
3) that the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and will
be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined
in the owner's fenced in yard until the proper enclosure is constructed. In
addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this
subsection shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they
present satisfactory evidence that: 1) their residence is and will continue to
be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and adults of the
presence of a dangerous animal on the property; and 2) the animal has been
permanently identified by means of a registered microchip implantation.
   I.   Cash Bond Required:
      1.   If any animal is seized under this section or any other section of
this chapter, the owner or custodian of said animal shall be liable for the
reasonable costs of the seizure and the care, keeping, and disposal of the
animal. Reasonable costs shall include, but shall not be limited to,
transportation, medical, board, shelter, and farrier costs.
      2.   If any animal is in the possession of, and being held by the city of
Pocatello pending the outcome of a criminal action charging a violation of this
chapter, prior to final disposition of the criminal charge, the city of
Pocatello may file a petition in the criminal case requesting that the court
issue an order forfeiting the animal to the city of Pocatello. The petitioner
shall serve a true copy of the petition upon the defendant.
      3.   Upon receipt of a petition pursuant to subsection I2 of this
section, the court shall set a hearing on the petition. The hearing shall be
conducted within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the petition. The
hearing shall be limited to the question of forfeiture of the animal.
      4.   At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection I3 of this section,
the petitioner shall have the burden of establishing probable cause to believe
that the animal was subjected to conduct which constitutes a violation of this
chapter, or that the animal has committed a violation of this chapter. A prior
finding of probable cause to proceed on the criminal case will create a
permissive presumption that probable cause exists for the forfeiture
proceeding. After the hearing, if the court finds probable cause exists, the
court shall order immediate forfeiture of the animal to the petitioner, unless
the defendant, within seventy two (72) hours of the hearing, posts a cash bond
with the municipal treasurer in an amount determined by the court to be
sufficient to repay all reasonable care of animal costs incurred, and
anticipated to be incurred, for the care of the animal up to the time set for
trial on the criminal case. If, after the hearing, the court finds that no
probable cause exists, the animal shall be returned to the owner/custodian, and
the owner/custodian shall not be responsible for any care of animal costs
unless the person later pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of
this chapter, at which time the defendant shall owe all care of animal costs as
restitution to the city of Pocatello in the criminal case.
      5.   At the end of the time for which expenses are covered by the cash
bond, if the owner/custodian desires to prevent disposition of the animal, the
owner/custodian shall post a new cash bond with the municipal treasurer which
must be received before the expiration date of the previous cash bond. The
court may correct, alter or otherwise adjust the new cash bond upon a motion
made before the expiration date of the previous cash bond, provided, however,
no person may file more than one motion seeking an adjustment to the new cash
bond.
      6.   If a cash bond has been posted in accordance with this subsection,
the city of Pocatello may draw from that cash bond reasonable care of animal
costs in keeping and caring for the animal from the date of the seizure to the
date of final disposition of the animal in the criminal action.
      7.   At the end of the time for which care of animal costs are covered by
the bond, if no additional cash bond has been posted in accordance with this
subsection, the city of Pocatello may determine disposition of the animal. The
owner/custodian of the animal shall be liable for all unpaid reasonable care of
animal costs. Posting of the cash bond shall not prevent the city of Pocatello
from disposing of the seized or impounded animal before the expiration of the
period covered by cash bond if the court orders the forfeiture of the animal or
the owner relinquishes the animal.
      8.   Upon resolution of the criminal action, including any appeal(s),
regardless of the court's decision of guilt or innocence, remaining funds
deposited with the municipal treasurer which have not, and will not be expended
for care of animal costs, shall be remitted to the owner/custodian of the
animal.
      9.   Regardless of any other provision of this section, if in the written
determination of a licensed veterinarian the animal is experiencing extreme
pain or suffering, or is severely injured or diseased and therefore not likely
to recover, the animal may be immediately euthanized.
      10.   No proceeding under this section shall be used as a basis for a
continuance or to delay the criminal case nor shall proceedings in the criminal
case, other than dismissal, be used as a basis to delay or continue the
forfeiture proceeding as provided for in this section. Proceedings under this
section are of a civil nature and governed by the Idaho rules of civil
procedure except as to limitations upon the discovery process. Due to the need
to conduct any proceeding necessary under this section in an expeditious manner
and the right of any criminal defendant to avoid self-incrimination, any and
all discovery requests shall be granted only under authority of the court.
Discovery mechanisms shall not include the deposition of any party, witness, or
representative, the use of interrogatories, requests for admission, or the
demand to inspect any records outside the immediate reports and financial
accountings for the animal in question.
      11.   "Care of animal costs" include, but are not limited to, costs of
transportation, medical care, food, shelter, boarding, impound fees, disposal
fees, and farrier fees. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord. 2894, 2011: Ord. 2884, 2010)
6.04.070: ANIMAL BITES; NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES:
   A.   When an owner/custodian of an animal has knowledge that his or her
animal has bitten a human being, a pet, domestic animal, or livestock, such
owner or custodian shall immediately notify personnel at the animal services
center or the police department of the time and circumstances of such bite, and
the name and address of the person bitten, if known, and the precautionary
provisions in regard to rabies set out in this chapter shall be followed.
   B.   When any person, including doctor, veterinarian, or medical facility
staff, has information that a person or domestic animal or livestock has been
bitten by another animal, he or she shall immediately notify personnel at the
animal services center or police department and the precautionary provisions in
regard to rabies set out in this chapter shall be followed. (Ord. 2975, 2016:
Ord. 2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.080: RABIES VACCINATION, QUARANTINE, AND DISEASE CONTROL:
   A.   Rabies Vaccination: The owner/custodian of any dog or cat shall be
responsible for having the animal vaccinated for rabies by a licensed
veterinarian and for keeping immunizations current. Vaccinations must begin
when the animal has reached the age of six (6) months. Every owner/custodian
must, upon request of an animal services officer or police officer, produce
proof of such vaccination(s).
   B.   Suspected Rabies; Quarantine Procedures: Any owner/custodian of any
animal which shows symptoms of rabies, or which has bitten any person, or other
animal, causing an abrasion to the skin, shall surrender the animal for
impoundment and isolation (quarantine) at the animal services center or to a
licensed veterinarian for a period of ten (10) days or shall securely confine
the animal on his/her premises for said period of time. The choice of place of
quarantine shall be at the discretion of the animal services center. All costs
for the quarantine shall be borne by the owner/custodian. If an owner/custodian
refuses to surrender or confine the animal, animal services officers are hereby
authorized to seize the animal and transport it to a licensed veterinarian.
Animal services officers or police officers are hereby authorized to
immediately impound any quarantined animal found outside the quarantine area
and arrange for its confinement in accordance with this section. If the animal
has been confined by the owner/custodian, on the next working day following the
ten (10) day quarantine, the owner/custodian shall take the animal to a
licensed veterinarian for examination to be tested for rabies and to obtain a
rabies vaccination if the owner has not provided a current valid rabies
vaccination certificate to the animal services center. A copy of the
examination results and a current certificate of rabies vaccination must be
provided to the animal services center no later than the following day. Failure
of the owner to comply with any of these provisions shall result in the
immediate impoundment of the animal, and it shall be subject to destruction or
disposal in accordance with policies of the animal services center and this
chapter. If an animal quarantined at the animal services center is determined
to be free of rabies, it shall be returned to the owner or custodian upon
payment of all costs for confinement, examination, and vaccination. If such
charges are not paid, the animal shall not be returned and shall be subject to
disposal in accordance with policies of the animal services center.
   C.   Premature Destruction; Preservation Of Head: It is unlawful for any
person to kill or cause to be killed any animal suspected of being rabid,
provided, however, that an animal services officer or other law enforcement
officer may kill any such animal if he determines that the animal is so
dangerous or wild that it cannot be restrained and impounded or that further
pursuit would result in losing the animal and if the animal can be killed with
gunshot so as not to damage the head. The head of any animal so killed must be
severed from the body and sent to the public health department for examination
and diagnosis.
   D.   Control Of Contagious Diseases: It is unlawful for any person to permit
or allow any animal with a contagious or infectious disease to be upon the
public streets, roads and ways of this city; or to be within any public
transportation facility or any other public building or place; or to expose
such animal in any public building or place, whereby the health, safety, and
well being of any person may be affected. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord. 2963, 2015:
Ord. 2884, 2010: Ord. 2764 § 2, 2005: Ord. 2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.090: IMPOUNDMENT:
The owner (or parent/guardian of any minor owner) of any animal found to be at
large within the city may be issued a notice of violation and assessed the fee
per occurrence as set by annual resolution of the city council, to be paid at
the animal services center. If the fee remains unpaid for a period of ten (10)
days, a five dollar ($5.00) late penalty shall be added. The notice of
violation shall be independent of any criminal misdemeanor or infraction
proceedings which might be instituted.
   A.   Impoundment By Property Owner: Any person finding an animal at large
upon his property may impound the animal and may take it immediately to the
Pocatello animal services center or shall immediately notify personnel at the
animal services center that he is holding the animal in his own possession and
provide a description of the animal and the name of the animal's owner, if
known. The animal services department shall dispatch an animal services officer
to impound the animal at the first reasonable opportunity to do so. If the name
of the owner/custodian is known or can be easily obtained, the officer may
return the animal to the residential address of the owner. If there is no one
present, the officer may impound the animal and shall leave written notice at
the residence of the person or place to contact to reclaim the animal. The
animal services officer shall then take the animal to the animal services
center for confinement.
   B.   Impoundment By Officers: In addition to any other remedies provided in
this chapter, animal services officers and police officers are authorized to
impound and confine at the animal services center any of the following animals:
      1.   Any dog without a valid license tag.
      2.   Any animal at large.
      3.   Any animal that is in violation of any quarantine or confinement
order.
      4.   Any unattended animal that is ill, injured, or otherwise in need of
care. Upon determination by any animal services center staff, police officer,
or veterinarian that the injury or illness is untreatable, the animal may be
euthanized by the officer or veterinarian without regard to the waiting period
set out below. Costs of medical care or euthanasia shall be borne by the owner/
custodian.
      5.   Any animal that is reasonably believed to have been abused or
neglected.
      6.   Any animal that is reasonably suspected of having rabies.
      7.   Any animal that is reasonably believed to be dangerous or a threat
to public health and safety.
      8.   Any animal that a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered
impounded or destroyed.
      9.   Any animal that is considered unattended or abandoned, e.g., due to
the owner's death, arrest or eviction from his or her residence, and there is
no sign of care for the animal. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord. 2697 § 10, 2002: Ord.
2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.100: TERMS OF IMPOUNDMENT AND REDEMPTION OR OTHER DISPOSITION:
   A.   The animal services center shall provide suitable and adequate food and
water for all animals impounded.
   B.   Any animal not reclaimed by its owner within three (3) working days
shall become the property of the city and shall be placed for adoption or
euthanized in a humane manner. The animal services director may refuse to allow
adoption to any person who has pled guilty to or been convicted of a violation
of this chapter. Appeal of denial may be made in writing within three (3)
calendar days to the city council. Specific animals shall not be held at the
center pending the council's decision, but may be adopted by other persons or
euthanized as provided above. The city council shall hear the appeal at the
next available regularly scheduled meeting and may either affirm or reverse the
denial. If the denial is reversed, the person may adopt any animal which is
available after the council's decision. Fees for adoption and euthanasia shall
be set from time to time by resolution of the city council.
   C.   If the name of the owner is readily available through license records,
the animal services center staff shall attempt to notify the owner by telephone
or mail or by hand delivery of a notice, or by notice attached to the door of
the residence of the animal's impoundment, providing the owner/custodian with
the contact information for the animal services department.
   D.   The animal services center shall keep a record of all animals impounded
which shall include a description of the animal, date of impoundment, date of
notification of impoundment, method of notification, date of redemption, and
record of fees paid or date of other disposition. In the case of adoption, the
record shall include the name, address and phone number of the person buying or
adopting the animal.
   E.   Redemption shall be made by providing satisfactory proof of ownership
and paying the required fees and charges, including, but not limited to,
impoundment fees, daily care fees, any required license fees, and medical
costs. All such fees, with the exception of medical costs, shall be set from
time to time by resolution of the city council. Copies of such resolutions
shall be kept on file and made available in the office of the city clerk. (Ord.
2975, 2016: Ord. 2963, 2015: Ord. 2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.105: ADOPTION; FEES AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Conditions: Adoption of an animal from the animal services
center shall be allowed upon agreement by the adopter to abide by conditions
set out in this chapter and in the adoption agreement, upon payment of the
required fees, and upon approval by the director of the animal services
department. The director of the animal services department may deny a request
for adoption of an animal if it is the director's opinion that the animal is a
problem animal, or the adopter has a documented history of possessing problem
animals, or the director has good cause to believe the adopter and the animal
are an inappropriate match. In the event the adoption of an animal is denied by
the director, the adopter may appeal the director's decision by filing a
written petition with the city clerk within three (3) business days of the
director's decision denying the adoption. The adopter's petition must request
that the city council review the director's decision at the next regularly
scheduled city council meeting for which agenda items are being accepted. The
animal services department shall be required to maintain the animal which is
the subject of the appeal until the city council has reached its decision on
the appeal. Within one day of filing a petition to appeal, the adopter shall
pay to the animal services department a deposit in an amount sufficient to
cover impound fees, veterinary fees, and any other fees determined to be
necessary for the proper care of the animal which is the subject of the appeal.
The amount of the deposit shall be determined by the director of the animal
services department. In the event the adopter's appeal is granted, the impound
fees shall be refunded to the adopter. The city council's decision on the
appeal shall be the final decision.
   B.   Alteration: Any dog or cat adopted from the center shall be altered
(spayed or neutered) by a licensed veterinarian either prior to adoption, or
within thirty (30) days of adoption, or as soon thereafter as the animal is old
enough to be altered. If the animal is not already altered, the adopter shall
agree to provide evidence of alteration to the animal services center within
thirty (30) days. For animals too young to be altered within thirty (30) days
of adoption, proof of alteration must be provided within thirty (30) days of
the age they become eligible for alteration, which date will be designated on
the adoption paperwork. Any person who has adopted a dog or cat from the center
who fails, neglects, or refuses to so provide evidence of alteration may be
charged with a misdemeanor violation.
   C.   Fees: The adoption fee, which shall include licensing fees, shall be
set by annual resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2975, 2016: Ord. 2963,
2015: Ord. 2838 § 4, 2008: Ord. 2686 § 1, 2002)
6.04.110: FIGHTING, TRAINING AND ATTACK COMMANDS PROHIBITED:
It is unlawful for any person to possess, harbor, or maintain any animal for
the purpose of fighting, or to train, torment, badger, bait, or use any animal
for the purpose of causing or encouraging it to attack or fight human beings or
other animals. Except when great bodily harm or death is likely to ensue
immediately, it is unlawful for any person, except for law enforcement
personnel directing animals regularly used by them in law enforcement, to
maliciously command, encourage, or aid by any means, any animal to bite, chase,
attack, or attempt to bite, chase, or attack another person or animal. (Ord.
2667 § 2, 2001)
6.04.120: PROPER CARE OF ANIMALS:

to provide the animal with any of the following: sufficient, good and wholesome
food, fresh, clean water, proper shelter and protection from the weather,
appropriate veterinary care to prevent suffering and/or treat disease, a clean
and wholesome living environment, and protection from abuse or misuse.
   B.   No owner or custodian of any animal shall wilfully abandon such animal
on any street, road, highway or public place, or on private property without
the consent of the owner thereof to provide care for the animal.
   C.   The owner/custodian of any animal which dies shall, within twenty four
(24) hours, provide for the burial, incineration, or other disposition of the
body of such dead animal in a safe and sanitary manner.
   D.   Animal services officers shall dispose of any animal found dead in the
city whose owner/custodian cannot be readily ascertained by removing the body
to the animal services center for disposition.
   E.   No person shall dye or color any rabbit, baby chick, ducklings, or
other fowl, or sell, offer for sale, barter, or give away chicks, ducklings,
other fowl, or rabbits less than three (3) weeks of age for any purpose.
Research facilities shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
   F.   It shall be unlawful for the owner/guardian of any animal to keep or
maintain any animal on a fixed point tether or chain for a period of more than

twenty four (24) hour period.
      1.   The chain or tether must be at least ten feet (10') in length and
placed in an area to prevent the animal from becoming tangled with any item or
other animal in its surrounding area or able to leave its property. The chain
or tether must be situated where it prevents the animal from reaching a fence
or sidewalk.
      2.   No chain or tether shall weigh more than one-eighth (1/8) of the
animal's body weight.
      3.   Any chain or tether must have swivels on both ends and be attached
to a properly fitted buckle type collar or harness worn by the animal. Choke
chains or pinch collars are prohibited for purposes of tethering an animal.
      4.   Any female animal in estrus (heat) must not be chained or tethered
at any time.

the animal services officer there is no time to wait for the veterinarian, then
the animal services officer may enter the vehicle with the assistance of a
Pocatello police officer and remove the animal(s) from potential harm.
      3.   If the animal services officer feels the animal can wait for the

2001)
6.04.170: MULTIPLE ANIMAL HOUSING LICENSES; NONCOMMERCIAL HOUSING OF MULTIPLE
ANIMALS:
   A.   Any person desiring to have three (3) or more dogs or more than five
(5) cats on his or her premises at any given time for purposes not covered by
commercial animal establishment licensing must apply for a multiple animal
housing license, in addition to obtaining individual dog licenses, on forms
provided by the animal services department, providing names of occupants of the
premises, address, number and type of dogs to be kept. The application must
also be accompanied by the written consent of at least seventy five percent
(75%) of the adult owners and/or occupants of all premises, excepting public
lands, within one hundred feet (100') of the perimeter of the applicant's
property, unless such requirement is excluded by the animal services director.
The animal services director shall review the application and shall deny the
license if any outdoor dog run area is closer than thirty feet (30') to the
nearest residence or building and may deny the license if the required proof of
consent has not been provided. The director may also deny the license if the
area is not sufficiently enclosed to prevent violations of this chapter or if
the applicant or other member of the household has had a violation of the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   In the event the license is approved, the owner must obtain individual
licenses for each dog to be housed, upon completion of which the multiple
animal housing license shall be issued for the specified number of animals,
subject to such conditions as may be deemed necessary by the director for
compliance with this chapter. If the licensee desires to house additional
animals not included on the license, he shall be required to apply in the same
manner and be subject to the same conditions as set out in subsection A of this
section. Provided, however, that the licensee shall not be required to license
any offspring of his/her licensed dogs or cats unless such animals are three
(3) months old and are still on site.
   C.   Such licenses must be renewed annually in the same manner as the
initial application process above and are subject to revocation for any
conviction for violations of the provisions of this chapter, or failure to
remove fecal material, or other conduct in violation of this chapter. Denial of
renewal is also at the discretion of the director, based upon the standards as
set out for the initial license and the reasons listed herein for revocation.

cause to be inspected, any facilities at reasonable hours, or at other times in

grooming or boarding facility not owned by the proprietor of the facility, are
exempt from the licensing requirement while kept in the facility. It is an
affirmative defense that the owner temporarily resides or travels in the city

are authorized to issue one 30-day extension if requested by the permittee in
order to complete the repair, provided permittee is in compliance with the
terms of the permit and of this title. If possible, storage and work on the
vehicles should be accomplished within the confines of an enclosed building, a
carport, or an area screened from public view. When not in an enclosed building
and not undergoing actual repair work, both vehicles must be under a car cover
which has been specifically made to fit the contours of and cover the entire
body of the vehicle; blankets, tarpaulins, or other such makeshift coverings

extension period, the salvage vehicle must be removed from the premises or the
code enforcement staff may cause a misdemeanor citation to be issued, or may
commence an enforcement action as outlined in this chapter or may also pursue
other legal remedies to effect the removal. Nothing herein shall be construed
to allow any person to perform such work in order to sell the repaired vehicle
to another party.
      2.   Restoration Permit: The code enforcement staff may issue a one year

original condition without storing the vehicle and working on it within an
enclosed building. If possible, work must be performed within the confines of a
carport or within a screened area. If not kept in an enclosed building, the
vehicle must be covered with a car cover as described in subsection C1 of this
section whenever work is not taking place. Members of the code enforcement
staff are authorized to issue one 180-day extension if requested by the
permittee in order to complete the repair, provided permittee is in compliance
with the terms of the permit and the property maintenance provisions in this
title. At the expiration of the permit or its extension period, if the vehicle
is not fully restored to working condition, the owner must either store the
vehicle in a fully enclosed building or remove the vehicle from the property.
Failure to do so may result in issuance of a misdemeanor citation, or may
commence an enforcement action as outlined in this chapter or the city may
pursue other legal remedies to effect the removal. (Ord. 2932, 2014)

appurtenances. This exemption is not a relief from provisions of this chapter
which control activities that impact public or private property.
      10.   Crushing and screening operations exceeding one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days of operation. These sites are subject to zoning and
conditional use permit requirements, and any other requirements specified by
this code. This exemption does not relieve such operations from provisions of
this chapter which control activities that impact public or private property.
   G.   Approval of an erosion control plan and issuance of a permit does not
relieve a person from the duty to ensure continuous compliance with all
conditions of the approved plan or permit, as well as all of the applicable
provisions of this chapter and appropriate federal requirements.
   H.   The permit may be suspended or revoked by the city at any time if the
site of the construction activity is not in full compliance with the conditions
of the approved erosion control plan, the permit, and all applicable provisions
of this chapter; the permit was issued in error; or the permit was based on
incorrect information.
   I.   Written notice shall be given by the city to the permittee of the
suspension or revocation of a permit, and this decision may be appealed in
accordance with the provisions of section
 8.44.140 of this chapter.
   J.   A permit shall automatically expire and become null and void if the
project for which the permit was issued is not commenced within a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance, the project for which the
permit was issued is suspended or abandoned for any reason within the permit
holder's control, or the time frame for conditions of a violation order has
elapsed without compliance. The project shall not recommence until the permit
has been renewed. Such renewal will require submittal of intent to renew the
permit, payment of the applicable fee, and approval of the city.
   K.   Once final landscaping and all of the requirements or conditions have
been completed and a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city of
Pocatello building official, the conditions of the permit shall cease. The
building official may require all denuded soil to be permanently stabilized
prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. In addition, any
charges, fees, cleanup costs and penalties must be paid before issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. The certificate of occupancy for a phased development
permit will not be issued until all lots have been completed or a legal
transfer of ownership has occurred. Notification for a legal transfer of
ownership must be made to the city within five (5) working days of the
transfer.
   L.   In cases where another person wishes to continue or complete work
previously commenced under a permit, said person shall either obtain a new
permit or gain transfer of the previous permit. The original permit holder will
be released from the permit once another person has become responsible for the
conditions for erosion and sediment. Such transfers must be approved by the
city.
   M.   Permits may be transferred to other persons upon approval of the city
after receiving a request for transfer and payment of the applicable fee. The
request must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the person to
whom the permit will be transferred. The involved parties shall be notified of
the decision of the city within ten (10) working days. If approved, all
conditions of the permit shall transfer to the new permit holder. If approval
is not granted, an appeal may be taken under the provisions of section
8.44.140 of this chapter. (Ord. 2859, 2008)
8.44.080: EROSION CONTROL PLANS:

permit for each approved erosion control plan.
   C.   An erosion control plan may not be approved in part. If the erosion
control plan is incomplete when initially submitted, it will be returned to the
submitter for completion. No activity allowed under the subject permit will be
allowed until the erosion control plan has been approved and the permit issued.
   D.   If an erosion control plan is not approved, a permit will not be
issued, and the applicable construction activity will not be allowed to
commence. This decision shall be communicated to the applicant and a new
erosion control plan will be required prior to the issuance of a permit. An
applicant may appeal a decision not to approve an erosion control plan pursuant
to the provisions of section
8.44.140 of this chapter.
   E.   Erosion control plans shall include the following:
      1.   Erosion control report which discusses, with supporting technical
documentation, the strategy of the proposed erosion control plan, and including
significant details of the BMPs which will be utilized. This report shall be
typed except for computational sheets, in good technical form, on eight and
one-half inches by eleven inches (8.5" x 11") paper and bound in a covered
binder. Maps, diagrams, and figures, except computer printouts, shall be
clearly labeled and folded to fit within the report. The report shall contain

applicant may file proof of the approved stormwater management plan in lieu of
submitting a new erosion control plan.
   G.   Erosion control plans may be modified at the permit holder's request
upon an approved application for modification and payment of the applicable
fee. Any modification deemed by the director of public works to be minor may be
approved on site by an authorized representative without the need for a formal
application and fee payment. The authorized representative shall document the
modification on a field report or correction notice, and the approved plans,
with a dated signature.
   H.   If the city's authorized representative determines the facilities or
techniques of an erosion control plan are not effective or are not sufficient
after prior approval, and such insufficiencies are having an impact on public
property or private property not controlled by the permit holder, or is placing
the city of Pocatello in violation of its NPDES permit, the city may order a
revised plan be submitted within a reasonable time period. If the revised plan
is not acceptable or is not immediately implemented upon approval, the permit
may be suspended or revoked. Any decision of the authorized representative or
director of public works regarding said revised plan may be appealed pursuant
to section
8.44.140 of this chapter.
   I.   Emergency control measures may be ordered when erosion products are
actually leaving the site or sediment deposition is occurring. These emergency
control measures will not relieve permit holders or applications of the duty to
file a revised plan if required by the city. (Ord. 2859, 2008)
8.44.090: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL STANDARDS:

imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be reduced by twenty five percent (25%)
if the applicant has completed the city's certification course or an accredited
training program from another Idaho municipality. The fee for a permit shall be
doubled if the construction activity is commenced prior to the issuance of the
permit, except where an emergency situation has been recognized by the director
of public works. Payment of the doubled fee shall not preclude the city from
taking any other enforcement actions within its authority.
   E.   The fee necessary to resubmit an application for an expired permit
shall be one-half (1/2) the regular fee for said permit. (Ord. 2859, 2008)

8.48.060: DISCLAIMER:
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.070: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall directly or
indirectly discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain
system, including city streets, roads and alleyways or watercourses, any
materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      1.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: uncontaminated water line flushing or other
potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water (as defined at 40 CFR section 35.2005(20)),
foundation or footing drains (not including active ground water dewatering
systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
individual, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or
wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than 1 ppm

source not containing pollutants of concern or other materials as described in
this chapter.
      2.   Discharges specified in writing by the Pocatello city director of
public works as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      3.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the city prior to the time of the test.
      4.   The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental
protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted by the city
for any discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made prior to the enactment of this chapter, regardless of whether
the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing
at the time of connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage or other nonstormwater discharges to
the municipal separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to
continue, without written city approval. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.080: SUSPENSION OF MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The city
of Pocatello director of public works may, without prior notice, suspend
municipal separate storm sewer system discharge access to a person or entity
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the municipal
separate storm sewer system or waters of the United States. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the director
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
municipal separate storm sewer system or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Termination Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the municipal separate storm sewer system in violation of this
chapter may have their municipal separate storm sewer system access terminated
if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its municipal separate storm
sewer system access. Notification shall be made in writing by certified mail to
the owner of the property from which the illicit discharge is being made at the
last known mailing address of said property owner on record with the Bannock
County assessor.
   C.   Written Approval Required For Reinstatement: Any person who reinstates
municipal separate storm sewer system access to premises terminated pursuant to
this section, without the prior written approval of the authorized enforcement
agency (city of Pocatello director of public works) is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.090: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required by the city prior to allowing of
discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.100: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with commercial activity and industrial
activity, including construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The director of public works or his authorized representative shall
be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.
If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the director of public
works or his authorized representative.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the director of public works or his
authorized representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must
be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and
the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law
related to said discharges.
      3.   The director of public works shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The director of public works has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated as required by the
manufacturer's operation manual to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the director of public works and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the director of public works access
to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of
this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit
to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a
misdemeanor offense if the person denies the director of public works access to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      7.   If the director of public works has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the director of public works may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord.
2860, 2008)
8.48.110: USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE
STORMWATER POLLUTANTS REQUIRED:
The city shall adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs)
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of
the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
applicable NPDES permit. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.120: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, shall keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse within said person's property free of
trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse.
In addition, the owner shall maintain existing privately owned structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a
hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord.
2860, 2008)
8.48.130: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, the municipal separate
storm sewer system, or waters of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the
event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies and the Idaho department of environmental
quality of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city director of public works within three
(3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years from the date of the discharge. (Ord.
2860, 2008)
8.48.140: VIOLATIONS CONSTITUTE MISDEMEANORS:
The knowing violation of any provision or failure to comply with any
requirement of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and may be
punishable by a fine up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment in
the county jail up to six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation
occurs may constitute a separate criminal offense. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.150: ACTS RESULTING IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS:
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, or discharges any
pollutant or causes pollution, may also be in violation of federal laws or
regulations, and may be subject to the sanctions of those laws or regulations,
including civil or criminal penalties, notwithstanding any legal action taken
by the city. (Ord. 2860, 2008)
8.48.160: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific, engineering, and other relevant
technical considerations. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards
and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure against all
unauthorized discharge of pollutants. This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the city, any agent or employee thereof for any damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder. (Ord. 2860, 2008)

the alarm system in a manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarms,
which is to include periodic maintenance and cleaning of the alarm system. The
alarm user shall also make every reasonable effort to respond or cause a
representative to respond to the alarm system location within thirty (30)
minutes when notified by the police department or alarm company to deactivate a
malfunctioning alarm system. The representative will provide access to the
premises or provide alternative security for the premises.
The alarm user may advise the police department that no representative will be
responding to the alarm site, however, failure of an alarm user or
representative thereof to respond to an alarm site may result in no further
police intervention at said site and for said occurrence due to the failure of
a representative to respond.
The alarm user shall not manually activate an alarm for any reason other than
an occurrence of an event that the alarm system was intended to report.
In the event of a fire alarm response, whether legitimate or false, the alarm

administrator may waive the written appeal and conduct the matter informally.

administrator shall send written notice of the action and statement of the
right to an appeal. The notice shall include the appropriate time frames and
procedures to file an appeal of the alarm administrator's decision.
An aggrieved alarm user can appeal the decision of the alarm administrator.

the fire chief, shall conduct a formal hearing and consider the evidence by any

on the basis of the preponderance of evidence presented at the hearing. The
chief of police or the fire chief must render a written decision within thirty
(30) days after the appeal hearing is held.
An aggrieved alarm user can appeal the chief of police's or fire chief's
decision to the city council after the formal hearing conducted by the chief of
police or the fire chief. After the chief of police or fire chief has issued a
decision following the formal hearing, the alarm user shall have ten (10)
business days to request, in writing, an appeal to the city council. Such

for abatement of the nuisance; furthermore, that if the property owner desires
such a hearing, a request for hearing, in writing, shall be given to the
designated enforcement officer prior to expiration of the ten (10) day notice,
and that abatement by the city will proceed if the property owner has not
exercised this option to request a hearing;
      5.   If said certified notice is returned as undeliverable, or is
unclaimed by the property owner, nothing shall preclude the city from
exercising its abatement option as specified herein.
   B.   When the ten (10) day notice has expired without a request for hearing,
the mayor's designated enforcement officer is authorized to remove, abate or
destroy the nuisance. The designated enforcement officer is authorized to

council, the hearing shall, if feasible, be placed on the agenda of the next

DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED
SECTION:
9.36.010: Purpose And Intent
9.36.020: Definitions
9.36.030: Prohibited Discriminatory Acts
9.36.040: Exceptions
9.36.050: Penalty
9.36.060: Mediation
9.36.070: Severability
9.36.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the finding and the intent of the city of Pocatello that no person shall
be denied his or her civil rights or be discriminated against based upon his or
her actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion,
creed, sex, age, marital or familial status, physical or mental disability,
sexual orientation, gender identity/expression. The Pocatello city council
declares that such discrimination prohibitions are necessary and desirable for
the following reasons:
   A.   In order to ensure that all persons, regardless of sexual orientation
and/or gender identity/expression enjoy the full benefits of citizenship and
are afforded equal opportunities for employment, housing, commercial property
and the use of public accommodations, the city of Pocatello has determined that
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/
expression must be addressed, and appropriate legislation enacted.
   B.   It is hereby declared to be public policy of the city of Pocatello that
discriminatory practices are detrimental because they impede the social and
economic progress of a city by preventing all of the city's citizens from
contributing to the cultural, spiritual, social, and commercial life of the
community. The contributions of all citizens of the city of Pocatello are
essential to the city's growth, vitality, and prosperity.
   C.   It is hereby declared that every individual in the city of Pocatello
has the right to work and earn wages through gainful employment, has the right
to seek housing, and has the right to enjoy public accommodation and
hospitality.
   D.   It is the intent of this chapter that all persons be treated fairly and
equally, and it is the express intent of this chapter to guarantee fair and
equal treatment under the law to all people in the city of Pocatello. The
denial of fair and equal treatment under the law due to sexual orientation or
gender identity/expression is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of
the city's citizens, and damages a city's economic well being.
   E.   This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the
city of Pocatello for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health
and peace of the city of Pocatello, its residents and the community.
   F.   The prohibitions against discriminatory acts as provided for in this
chapter are intended to supplement state and federal civil rights law
prohibiting discrimination in the areas of employment, public accommodations,
and housing. For complaints, alleging discrimination on a basis proscribed
under state or federal law (e.g., race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age,
gender, national origin, and/or disability) the complainant is advised of his
or her right to file a report alleging a violation of Idaho Code section 18-
7301 et seq., and/or his or her right to file a complaint with the Idaho
commission on human rights and/or the federal equal employment opportunity
commission pursuant to title VII of the civil rights act of 1964 as amended,
the fair housing act of 1968 as amended, or the Americans with disabilities act
of 1990 as amended. (Ord. 2921, 2013)

RESIDENT ONLY PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM
SECTION:
10.34.010: Purpose And Scope

10.34.080: Unlawful Use Of Decals Or Permits
10.34.090: Severability
10.34.010: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
This chapter authorizes a program and an implementing procedural system by
which property owners and residents in qualifying residential districts can
receive preferential treatment when competing with commuter vehicles for
available street parking in congested areas. Such congestion, particularly when
caused by long term parking of vehicles on residential streets by nonresidents
thereof who are not visiting or conducting business with residents, creates
adverse impacts on the public's general health, safety, and welfare. The burden
of the adverse impact is particularly borne by the residents contributing to
neighborhood decline. In these situations, uniform parking regulations do not
serve the public's interest, contribute to such decline, and often allow
nonresidents to ignore alternatives lessening such congestion. (Ord. 2408,
1992)
10.34.020: DESIGNATION OF RESIDENT ONLY PARKING AREAS; ISSUANCE OF PERMITS:
   A.   For purposes of this chapter, "resident only" permits shall be
construed to include permits for employees of churches or other service
organizations within the designated resident only areas. For purposes of this
chapter, references to the "traffic engineering staff", "city engineer and/or
his/her designee", or "city staff" shall be construed to mean any staff member
or officer designated by the mayor to operate, manage, or conduct the program.
   B.   Said persons are hereby authorized to issue resident only permits to
employees described above as well as to issue passes/permits for healthcare
providers, in home service providers, meals on wheels, and similar
organizations to allow their staff to attend to clients living in all the
resident only parking areas. The city engineer and/or his/her designee is
hereby authorized to establish procedures for applications and issuance of
permits in accordance with this chapter, design appropriate application forms,
order supplies, erect or remove signs as needed, and perform such other duties
and services as might be necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   C.   The city engineer and/or his/her designee shall establish resident only
parking areas and erect signs to so notify the public along those streets in
the vicinity of Pocatello High School, Highland High School, and Idaho State
University which he deems appropriate based upon his traffic and congestion
studies. The studies shall consider the extent to which legal on street parking
spaces are occupied by motor vehicles; the extent to which vehicles parking in
the area are vehicles other than resident vehicles; and the extent to which
resident motor vehicles in the residential area cannot be accommodated by the
number of available off street parking spaces. Notification of this designation
and the procedures for obtaining permits shall be mailed to each residence and/
or property owner along the streets so designated by the city engineer and/or
his/her designee. Parking in such areas during the hours of seven thirty
o'clock (7:30) A.M. to five thirty o'clock (5:30) P.M. shall be allowed only
for vehicles displaying either a resident's decal or a visitor's permit card or
an all area pass. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 1, 2002: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.030: REMOVAL OF DESIGNATION; DELETION OF STREETS FROM RESIDENT ONLY
PARKING AREAS:
Information generated through the original designation process and criteria set
forth in this chapter shall also be utilized by the city engineer and/or his/
her designee in determining whether to remove the resident only designation
from any portion of an area previously so designated.
   A.   Procedure; Notice: The city engineer and/or his/her designee may remove
a resident parking only area from designation under the program or delete a
portion thereof after giving written notice of such intentions to the residents
of dwelling units and other affected parties in the area subject to the
proposed changes. The notice shall contain a description of the area or streets
to be deleted from the permit parking area and the date, time, and place of a
public hearing to consider the proposed changes.
   B.   Hearing And Results: The city engineer and/or his/her designee shall
explain the factors justifying his proposal and hear objections at this hearing
and shall render a final decision on the proposal within thirty (30) days of
the hearing. Said decision shall be rendered, in writing, and filed with the
Pocatello police department with copies mailed to residents along the affected
streets. If removal from designation is approved, the city engineer and/or his/
her designee shall cause all signs designating the area as resident only
parking to be immediately removed. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 2, 2002: Ord.
2408, 1992)
10.34.040: PERMITS; FORM; APPLICATION; FEE REQUIRED; RESTRICTED AREAS:
   A.   Form Of Permit: Once an area has been designated a resident only
parking area, city staff shall issue parking permits in the form of decals and
visitor tags to applicants determined eligible for the permits under this
chapter. A resident's parking permit shall entitle him/her to one decal and one
visitor tag, plus any additional decals or tags as provided hereafter. The
permits shall be valid from August 15 of a year through August 14 of the
following year, and be in the form of numbered, color coded decals or, for
visitors, in the form of numbered, color coded plastic tags. Decals must be
placed on the left rear window, or if there is no rear window or the decal
cannot be clearly seen through the rear window, on the left front window of the
vehicle; tags must be hung from the rearview mirror or placed on the dashboard
so as to be plainly visible from the sidewalk or street.
   B.   Application, Number And Type Of Permits: Applicants must appear in
person and sign and complete a form provided by the city, certifying their
status as full time residents, or other parties eligible under this chapter,
and present proof of identification, address, current vehicle registration, and
license plate number. Owners of residential rental property who reside outside
the area may receive one visitor tag upon presentation of proof of ownership of
the property and payment of the required fee in addition to the requirements
listed above. Fees shall be nonrefundable and shall not be prorated. Fees for
the 2002-2003 program shall be as set forth herein. Thereafter, fees shall be
set by annual resolution of the city council. After determination of an
applicant's qualifications and receipt of the fees, the traffic engineering
staff may issue permits as follows:
      1.   Single dwellings (house/townhouse): One set (1 decal and 1 visitor
tag); maximum of two (2) decals and two (2) tags per dwelling.
 
2002-2003 fee: $5.00 for 1 set
               $5.00 each per extra decal or tag
 
      2.   Multiple dwelling structure: One set per unit; maximum of two (2)
decals and one visitor tag per unit; nonresident landlord allowed one visitor
tag.
 
               $5.00 per set
2002-2003 fee: $5.00 for extra decal
               $3.00 for landlord tag
 
      3.   Churches/service organizations located within a specific area:
Maximum of ten (10) decals for verified regular employees/caretakers.
 
2002-2003 fee: $20.00 flat rate
 
      4.   Governmental/service organizations (home health, meals on wheels):
Maximum of ten (10) passes valid for all areas. No charge for nonprofit
organizations.
 
Others: 2002-2003 fee: $20.00
 
Additional decals or tags may be issued, upon receipt of the appropriate fee,
if the Pocatello police department or designee determines that extenuating
circumstances warrant the deviation. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision
to the public works director in writing within seven (7) days of the decision.
Fees for 2002-2003 for extra decals or visitor's permits shall be five dollars
($5.00) each; for replacement of lost visitor tags, three dollars ($3.00).
   C.   Permit Not A Guarantee: Issuance of a permit shall not be construed to
guarantee or reserve to the holder thereof an on street parking space within
the designated residential permit parking area, nor to allow parking in
violation of limitations set out in this chapter. (Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 §
3, 2002: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.050: VISITOR PERMITS:
The Pocatello police department shall issue two (2) visitor permit cards for
each residence in the areas for residents to give to visitors for temporary
display in vehicles parked on the streets. Residents who are planning events
which require additional temporary permits may request them from the Pocatello
police department and must return any such additional permits to the Pocatello
police department no later than three (3) days after the event. Failure to
return extra permit cards will result in revocation of resident parking
privileges and the Pocatello police department is hereby authorized to so
revoke the permit and notify the resident of the revocation. (Ord. 2972, 2016:
Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.060: LIMITATIONS ON PARKING IN PERMIT AREA:
   A.   Permit holders and/or visitors shall be allowed to park only on either
side of the street, between the intersecting side streets, on the block on
which the property(ies) for which the permit has been issued is (are) located.
   B.   The owner of any vehicle parked in a resident only parking area without
the display of either a current resident's decal, a pass valid for all areas,
or a visitor's permit tag during the days and/or hours posted for the area
shall be in violation of this chapter. A parking violation notice may be issued
to the owner of the vehicle, except for vehicles in the following
circumstances:
      1.   A vehicle displaying a resident's decal affixed to the left rear
window, or if there is no rear window or if the decal cannot be clearly seen
through the rear window, on the left front window of the vehicle, or displaying
a visitor's permit card hung from the rearview mirror or prominently displayed
on the dashboard so as to be readily visible from the sidewalk or street; or
      2.   An emergency vehicle, including, but not limited to, an ambulance,
fire engine, or police vehicle; or
      3.   A clearly marked vehicle which is under the control of a person
providing a service to persons or property located in the designated
residential permit only area, including, but not limited to, a delivery
vehicle.
   C.   Police department staff and officers are authorized to issue parking
violation notices to the owners of any vehicles found in violation of the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2684 § 4, 2002: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.070: DURATION OF PERMIT:
Each parking permit, including visitor permits, shall be valid from August 15
of the year in which it is issued through August 14 of the subsequent year.
(Ord. 2438 § 1, 1993: Ord. 2408, 1992)
10.34.080: UNLAWFUL USE OF DECALS OR PERMITS:
   A.   It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for a person to
falsely represent himself as eligible for a parking permit or to furnish false
information in an application therefor. It shall be unlawful for any person to:
1) obtain or attempt to obtain or display a permit or pass issued under this
chapter, or 2) to park a vehicle bearing a valid permit or pass issued under
this chapter in a resident only parking area, unless he or she is a full time
resident of the dwelling unit for which the permit has been issued or is a bona
fide employee of organizations eligible for permits or passes as specified in
this chapter and has been issued a permit in his own name. No person who is
issued a permit shall allow it to be used by, or offer it for use to, any other
person.
   B.   It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for a person
holding a valid parking permit issued pursuant hereto to permit the use or
display of such permit on a motor vehicle other than that for which the permit
is issued or intended. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for
a person possessing visitor tags issued pursuant hereto to permit the use or
display of such tag on a vehicle parked in the resident only area unless the
driver/occupants are on the premises or inside the residence for which the
permit was issued while the vehicle is so parked. Such conduct shall constitute
an unlawful act both by the person holding the parking permit/tag and the
person who so uses or displays the permit/tag. In addition to any other
penalties, such a violation shall result in revocation of the resident's permit
for the balance of the year and the Pocatello police department shall so notify
the resident. In the event a vehicle bearing a permit decal is sold, the owner
shall remove the decal and inform the traffic engineering staff who shall in
turn cancel that permit.
   C.   Any person aggrieved by the revocation of a permit has the right to
appeal to the public works director within seven (7) days of such revocation.
(Ord. 2972, 2016: Ord. 2684 § 5, 2002: Ord. 2408, 1992)

The provisions of this chapter are severable and if any provision, clause,
sentence, subsection, section, word, or part thereof is held to be illegal,
invalid, or unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person or circumstance,
such illegality, invalidity, or unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall

excavation in any public street, alley, or other public place, to maintain safe
crossings for vehicular traffic as well as for pedestrians. All materials
excavated shall be compactly stacked along the side of the excavation and will
be so trimmed as not to inconvenience the traveling public. In the event the
street where the excavation is being made is not wide enough to hold the
materials without using a portion of the adjacent sidewalk, the person making
the excavation will erect and maintain during the course of construction a
tight board fence along and upon the sidewalk and maintain at least a four foot
(4') width walkway. All gutters during excavation shall be maintained free and

the surface is gravel or earth, shall be made by first cutting completely
through the pavement for the length and width of the opening to be made. The
cutting shall be done with air or mechanical tools in order to separate the
pavement to be removed from the adjoining paved surface.
   E.   A violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof a person shall be punishable as
provided in section
1.04.040 of this code. (Ord. 2876 § 3, 2009: prior code § 9-5-10)

under the provisions of this chapter in any public street or other public
thoroughfare to maintain adequate and sufficient barriers at each end of such
excavation and at any other places designated by the city, and also to place
and maintain lights at each end of such excavation at a distance of not more

shall be packed at least one foot (1') on top of any pipe or other utility, and
in the event the materials removed from the excavation do not comply with the
description of the materials used in this chapter, the permittee shall be
obligated to furnish fine granular material for such purpose. All backfill
material shall be thoroughly compacted around the pipe or other utility. The
excavation shall also be backfilled with earth from the trench excavated to a
depth of twelve inches (12") below the subgrade of the curb, gutter, pavement,
sidewalk or driveway to be replaced or to the surface if no improvement
replacement is indicated.
   B.   The use of water in making the backfill is prohibited if the soil will
not readily drain or if the adjacent street may become damaged or the paving
unduly delayed. Should the material from the excavation fail to give the
required compaction, the permittee under this chapter shall be obligated to
import material of the proper types. In making the backfill, the permittee
shall be obligated to remove all excess water before placing another layer of
backfill material.
   C.   If an improvement replacement is indicated, the upper twelve inches
(12") of the trench immediately below the subgrade of the improvement to be
replaced shall be filled in four inch (4") layers, measured before compaction,
with selected imported granular material of such character as to readily
compact by sprinkling with water if too dry to tamp and thoroughly compacted by
power driven equipment.
   D.   All work shall be done in such a manner as to obtain a relative
compaction throughout the entire depth of the backfill of not less than that
which exists adjacent to the excavation but in every case the work shall be
done in such a manner as to obtain a relative compaction of not less than
ninety five percent (95%).
   E.   A violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof a person shall be punishable as
provided in section 1.04.040 of this code. (Ord. 2876 § 3, 2009: prior code §

specifications of the city and to the satisfaction of the city engineer, except
replacement of pavement shall be done by the city for all sanitary sewer house
connections.

authorized representative, immediately repair any injury or damage in any
portion of the street which occurs as a result of the work done under the
permit, including any and all damage to the street which would not have
occurred had such work not been done, and which, in the opinion of the city

cause the pruning or removal of any such tree on private or public property.
   C.   No tree growing near a sidewalk shall be cut down or removed solely
because of the interference it causes or may cause with a sidewalk, unless the
city forester in conjunction with the city engineer finds that the sidewalk
cannot reasonably be reconstructed without removal of the tree. When feasible,
sidewalks shall be reconstructed around trees so that trees are not removed
solely to facilitate construction of sidewalks. The cost for the reconstruction
of the sidewalk shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner.
(Ord. 2812, 2007)
12.28.130: NOTICE TO ABATE:
The city shall notify in writing the owners of property, or if known, the

trees which are deemed through inspection by an authorized city staff member to
be a public nuisance pursuant to section
12.28.110 of this chapter. The written notice shall include the property
address, a description of the violation, the corrective action the owners must
undertake to abate the nuisance, and the name, address and phone number of the
city staff member to contact in regard to the violation. Owners shall abate the
nuisance at their own expense within thirty (30) days of the date of service of
notice. Failure of the city to give a notice shall not relieve the owners from
the obligation to abate said nuisance. The notice shall also include
information on the owners' right to make written request for a preabatement
hearing before the P&R director, or his designee.
If the property owner elects to request a formal hearing, such request must be
made in writing and be delivered by five o'clock (5:00) P.M. at least one day
prior to the proposed abatement date to the city staff member named in the
written notice, giving notice of the property owner's intent to appeal. Upon
timely receipt of a request for a formal hearing, the P&R director, or his
designee, shall provide written notice to the requesting party, which notice
shall state the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be
scheduled no sooner than five (5) business days and no later than ten (10)
business days after the city's receipt of the request. The P&R director, or his
designee, shall make a record of the preabatement hearing and shall, within ten
(10) business days of the hearing, render a written decision with supporting
reasons which shall be sent to the property owner by U.S. certified mail,
return receipt requested. The property owner may appeal any decision of the P&R
director to the city council of the city of Pocatello. The appeal to the city
council must be filed with the city clerk within ten (10) calendar days of the
property owner's receipt of the P&R director's written decision. If such a
request for an appeal is submitted, the city council shall hear the appeal at
its next available regularly scheduled meeting, and the city clerk shall notify
the appellant as to the date and time of the meeting. At the meeting, the
council will consider whether the requirements stated in the original notice of
abatement should be modified, withdrawn, or enforced as written, and shall
specify a deadline for any corrective action they deem necessary. (Ord. 2877 §
5, 2009)
12.28.140: ASSESSMENT OF COSTS:
   A.   If the owner fails to comply with the notice provisions, the city shall
have the authority to cause the abatement of the nuisance and charge the cost
of abatement to the offender.
   B.   Whenever the city has paid for or has caused to be accomplished the
trimming, cutting, destroying and/or removal of trees, weeds, grass,
deleterious, unhealthful growths, rubbish, or other noxious matter as set forth
herein, the actual cost thereof, plus accrued interest at the rate of five
percent (5%) per year from the date of the completion of the work shall be
charged to the owner of such property, who shall be given thirty (30) days'
written notice specifying the amount due and stating that any portion of said
amount unpaid at the end of the thirty (30) days shall be filed as an
assessment against the property, and collectable as provided hereunder.
   C.   If the full amount due is not paid within thirty (30) days after the
date of the notice, the expenses may be certified to the city clerk and
transmitted to the county treasurer, and be collected by special assessment
upon the property to the extent provided by law. Any such certificate, upon
being recorded at the office of the county recorder shall become a lien against
the property to the extent provided by law. The city may also seek recovery of
its expenses, including costs and reasonable attorney fees, by civil action
filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Where it has been determined that a public tree has been damaged or
removed unlawfully the offending person or firm shall be assessed the cost of
repair or replacement. The city forester shall determine that cost using
accepted plant appraisal methods as set forth in the current edition of the
"Guide For Plant Appraisal", published by the International Society of
Arboriculture. (Ord. 2812, 2007)
12.28.150: SEVERABILITY:

result in a refusal by the city to permit the new construction project to
connect to the above named municipal public services.
   B.   Written Notice Of Noncompliance: If any recipient, whether a person,
entity, or institution, of municipal public services fails to comply with the
provisions of subsection A of this section, and the city determines termination

notice of intent to terminate service(s) by first class, postage prepaid mail,

serve the property, all costs associated with the extension and installation
shall be borne by the person seeking to so build or develop. After final
acceptance as set forth below, all such water mains and appurtenances shall be
deemed a part of the public water system and shall be maintained by the city.
   B.   All such water main extensions and installations shall be located in
dedicated public right of way areas and shall extend the full length of the
frontage of the property being served. The superintendent may require or allow
water mains to be installed in utility easements if he deems it necessary for
the good of the public water system. All water main extensions/installations
shall conform in all respects to the standards, specifications, and material
requirements set forth in this chapter.
   C.   No such installation shall be deemed complete until inspected,
approved, and accepted by the water superintendent for maintenance by the city;
provided, however, that final acceptance shall not occur until the installation
has shown two (2) years of satisfactory service after approval. The person
developing or building shall be required to maintain, repair, and/or alter the

mains shall be considered to have been dedicated to the city by said person as
part of the public water system and shall be maintained by the city.
   D.   All water main extensions and appurtenant equipment which have been
installed in private roadways or property, shall be and remain the private
property of the persons, their heirs, successors or assigns, owning said
property, and shall be maintained by them, unless a specific written agreement
with the city makes other provisions. Provided, however, that the water
superintendent may authorize repair or maintenance work by the water department
on private sections only in an emergency situation where the public welfare may
be endangered. (Ord. 2736 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.04.310: WATER SUPPLY CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION:
The following sections are intended to maximize the ability of the city to
provide an adequate water supply for essential services in time of drought,
natural disasters, or other emergencies. All persons whose premises are
connected to city water service shall be required to comply with regulations
set out below during a declared period of water shortage or water emergency.
(Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.320: DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY FOR DECLARATION:
The superintendent shall maintain records and monitor conditions and resources
to enable the city to plan for and provide water to consumers using the city's
water system. Whenever in his estimation those conditions are approaching the
level of a water shortage, he shall provide a report to so inform the mayor,
who may then choose to issue a declaration of water shortage which will impose
those conditions and restrictions on water usage as set out hereinafter. The
report of the superintendent will include an evaluation of the following:
current aquifer levels; available ground water supply and operational condition
of city wells; current storage tank levels; the rate of decline in aquifer
levels compared with the normal operating levels; projected weather conditions
as derived from short and long term weather forecasts; whether prior weather
conditions over the previous year(s) have been particularly dry with lower than
normal rain and snow fall quantities; whether total aquifer storage is
significantly below historical "normal" levels for the current time of year,
and whether data strongly indicate that expected demands may not be met if this
trend continues and/or worsens; whether current operating conditions would
limit the city's ability to provide water; the occurrence of an extended power
failure which limits the city's ability to operate its facilities; and any
state or federally imposed water restrictions which require the city to reduce
the amount of water withdrawn from the aquifer. In the event that an emergency
exists or is imminent the superintendent shall so inform the mayor immediately.
(Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.330: DECLARATION OF SHORTAGE OR EMERGENCY; EFFECT:
In the event the mayor reasonably determines that the situation warrants the
declaration of a water shortage or water emergency, the mayor is authorized to
make an official declaration thereof and to suggest or impose any or all of the
restrictions set forth hereinafter which he deems necessary to safeguard the
safety and health of the general public. The mayor or his/her designee shall
issue a public notification of the declaration which shall specify the nature
and extent of the restrictions; in the event of a declaration of critical water
shortage the restrictions will take effect twenty four (24) hours after
notification; for a water emergency the restrictions shall take effect
immediately upon issuance of the public notification. Notice shall be deemed
given by means of newspaper, radio, and television announcements and a notice
posted on the city's website if operational. The superintendent may provide
such other notices as he deems useful. Alleged lack of notice shall not relieve
a water consumer from the duty to abide by the restrictions. After the initial
declaration of either a shortage or emergency and imposition of restrictions,
the city council shall have the opportunity to review the situation at the next
regularly scheduled council meeting at which time the council shall review the
circumstances surrounding the declaration, the type of declaration, and the
restrictions imposed and thereafter determine whether to continue the
restrictions under the declaration, cancel the declaration and restrictions, or
alter the restrictions as deemed necessary after review of the then current
situation. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.340: CATEGORIES AND RESTRICTIONS FOR SHORTAGE AND EMERGENCIES:
   A.   Minor Shortage; Voluntary Restrictions: If the mayor declares a minor
water shortage, he shall accompany the declaration with a list of recommended
water conservation measures, which shall not be required, but are voluntary on
the part of the consumers. The superintendent is hereby authorized to conduct
an intensified public information campaign to encourage such voluntary
conservation measures. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Discontinuing direct hosing of sidewalks, walkways, driveways,
parking lots, patios, and other exterior paved or prepared surface areas,
except as may be necessary to remove or prevent accumulation of conditions or
materials dangerous to the public health and safety.
      2.   Discontinuing noncommercial washing of privately owned motor
vehicles, trailers, and boats, unless accomplished by using limited amounts of
water through use of a bucket of water for washing and a hose with an automatic
shutoff nozzle for rapid rinsing.
      3.   Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems between
the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and six o'clock (6:00) P.M.
      4.   Discontinuing operation of sprinkler and irrigation systems outside
of a suggested conservation rotation schedule.
      5.   Careful and regular monitoring of water use and private water
service and distribution lines to prevent loss of water through leaks or breaks
within the private service or distribution lines.
      6.   Prevention of overspray from irrigation systems beyond the area
intended for watering and prevention of runoff beyond the intended area.
      7.   Discontinuing automatic serving of tap water at restaurants unless
requested by patrons.
   B.   Critical Water Shortage; Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that the
superintendent determines that the water shortage is approaching a critical
stage, he shall prepare a report for the mayor detailing the problem. The mayor
may then declare a critical water shortage and provide notice to the public of
the restrictions being imposed, which may include any or all of the items set
forth above as he deems most useful in maintaining the necessary water supply.
   C.   Water Emergency; Restrictions And Rationing:
      1.   Mandatory Restrictions: In the event that maximum flow reduction is
immediately required, the mayor shall issue a declaration of water emergency,
and may prohibit all nonessential uses of water or impose any other
restrictions he deems appropriate to attempt to maintain a supply of water for
essential services.
      2.   Disaster; Water Rationing: In the event of a local or regional
disaster, the water supply may be jeopardized to the extent that all available
water is needed solely for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.
In such circumstances, the mayor may also implement water rationing measures
and emergency water distribution may be necessary for customers without water.
Residential users may be restricted to a certain number of gallons per day per
person residing within the dwelling unit and the amount of water used by
nonresidential users may be restricted to a percentage of their historical
usage as deemed appropriate by the superintendent, and/or by any other type of
rationing as he deems necessary and appropriate in the circumstances. The
public works and utilities department shall disseminate information to
consumers regarding the rationing plan. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.350: WATER RESTRICTIONS; EXCEPTIONS:
The mayor is further authorized to make exceptions to such restrictions in
specific cases as he finds reasonable which may include, but are not limited
to, watering of newly seeded or sodded lawns or of food sources, when necessary
to alleviate unnecessary economic hardship to commercial or industrial
activities, or to prevent possible damage to health, safety or welfare. (Ord.
2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.360: VIOLATIONS; ISSUANCE OF INFRACTION CITATIONS:
It is unlawful for any person to violate water use restrictions imposed under
this chapter, unless an exception in writing has been granted by the mayor.
Violation of these provisions shall be an infraction, punishable as provided by
the Idaho Code for nonmoving infractions. Each violation of restrictions issued
under this chapter may result in issuance of a separate infraction citation.
Upon the issuance of the third infraction violation for an account, the utility
billing department is authorized to terminate water service to the premises.
Standard turn on and turn off fees set by city council resolution shall be
charged, and water service shall not be reinstated until all fees have been
paid in full.
In the event that repeated violations at the same premises are noted during the
term of any declaration hereunder, and if the police are unable to make contact
with the responsible party due to what appears to be deliberate avoidance of
service rather than absence from the jurisdiction, after the third such
documented instance of violation, the police shall contact the utility billing
department, and the supervisor of that department shall arrange for water
service to the premises to be terminated. Standard turn on and turn off fees
set by city council resolution shall be charged, and water services shall not
be reinstated until all fees have been paid in full. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)
13.04.370: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase, part or portion of this chapter is for any reason
held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction,
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this
chapter. (Ord. 2738 § 3, 2004)

liquids, gases, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the potable
supply of water from any source or sources.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE (APPROVED): A device that has been investigated
and approved by the regulatory agency having jurisdiction. The approval of
backflow prevention devices by the regulatory agency should be on the basis of
a favorable laboratory and field evaluation report by an "approved testing
laboratory" recommending such approval.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE (TYPE): Any effective device used to prevent
backflow into a potable water system. The type of device used should be based
on the degree of hazard either existing or potential.
   CONTAMINATION: The entry into or presence in a public water supply of any
substance which may be deleterious to health and/or quality of the water.
   CROSS CONNECTION: Any unprotected actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement between a public or a consumer's potable water system
and any other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into
any part to the potable system any used water, industrial fluid, gas, or
substance other than the intended potable water with which the system is
supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel
or changeover devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or
because of which "backflow" can or may occur are considered to be cross
connections.
   DEGREE OF HAZARD: Shall be derived from the evaluation of a health, system,
plumbing or pollutional hazard.
   DIRECTOR: The director of public works or the city, or his authorized agent.
   HAZARD, HEALTH: An actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical

located in many types of structures including homes, apartment houses, hotels
and commercial or industrial establishments.
   HAZARD, POLLUTIONAL: An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system but which would not constitute a health or
system hazard, as defined in this section. The maximum degree or intensity of
pollution to which the potable water system could be degraded under this
definition would cause a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could
cause minor damage to the system or its appurtenances.
   HAZARD, SYSTEM: An actual or potential threat of severe danger to the
physical properties of the public or consumer's potable water system or of a
pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality

13.08.040: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES; WHEN REQUIRED; FAILURE TO INSTALL:
No water service connection (potable, irrigation or fire protection) to any
premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the
water supply is protected as required by state law and regulation and this
chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water
purveyor if a backflow prevention device required by this chapter is not
installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
device has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists
on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects
are corrected. (Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.08.050: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES; INSPECTION:
The consumer's system should be open for inspection and tests at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the purveyor to determine whether cross
connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of
these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the director
shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for
a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the
conditions in conformance with the state and city statutes relating to plumbing
and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 2653,

line leading off the service line. (Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.08.070: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES; CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INSTALLATION:
Backflow prevention devices shall be installed under circumstances including,
but not limited to, the following:
   A.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply;
   B.   Premises having cross connections that are not correctable, or
intricate planning arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether
or not cross connections exist;
   C.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist;
   D.   Premises having a history of cross connections being established or
reestablished;
   E.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters;
   F.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled in
such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard might
result;
   G.   Where it is deemed necessary to protect the city's water meter from hot
water, steam or other possible contaminants, the water department shall have
the right to order the owner to install check valves and pressure relief valves
which must be approved by the water superintendent, and failure on the part of
the owner to install such valves within ten (10) days after written notice has
been served shall be sufficient cause for discontinuance of water service. The
owner may request a hearing prior to discontinuance as provided in section
13.04.130 of this title.
   H.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public
water unless the purveyor determines that no hazard exists. See Idaho
regulations for public drinking water systems 1-8306.03.

the hazard to be great enough he may require certified inspections at more
frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the
water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the
director. The consumer user shall notify the director in advance when the tests
are to be undertaken so that he or his representative may witness the tests if
so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the consumer user whenever the devices are found to be defective.
Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and copies sent to
the director. (Ord. 2653, 2000)

   C.   Inspections shall be made at the discretion of the director of all
buildings, structures, or improvements of any nature now receiving water
through the city's system, for the purpose of ascertaining whether cross
connections exist. Such inspections shall be made by the purveyor. (Ord. 2653,
2000)
13.08.160: INSTALLATION PERMITS:
If cross connection control devices are found to be necessary, the owner of the
property served must apply to the purveyor for a specific installation permit.
(Ord. 2653, 2000)
13.08.170: LIABILITY:
This chapter shall not be construed to hold the city responsible for any damage
to persons or property by reason of the inspection or testing in this chapter,
or the failure to inspect or test by reason of approval of any cross

a sufficient private sewer line which shall connect the land, building or
premises to the nearest accessible sanitary sewer within ninety (90) days after
date of official notice.
   B.   In cases where the above connection is impractical, as determined by
the Director, a private septic system may be permitted provided that a one acre
minimum parcel size exists and the parcel is or can be served by a Municipal
water supply. If the parcel is served by a private water supply, the parcel
size must be a minimum of two and one-half (21/2) acres before a private septic
system may be permitted.
   C.   Each premises for which title may be transferred, whether connected to
another structure under one roof, or standing separately on a single parcel of
land, shall be required to have its own separate sewer service line, except as

extend the main line(s) and provide connection for private service lines from
said parcel to the extended main line(s), unless otherwise determined by the
Director.
   F.   If a condominium association is to be the party of record responsible
for sewer billing, the association may, after approval of plans and
specifications by the Public Works Director, and written agreement with the
City, obtain sewer service to multiple residences without the necessity of a
separate sewer service line installation for each residence thereon.
   G.   Once connected to the City sewer system, it shall be unlawful to
disconnect from the City sewer system. (Ord. 3029, 2019)
13.16.090: SEPARATE SEWERS FOR EACH BUILDING:
Each premises for which title may be transferred, whether connected to another
structure under one roof, or standing separately on a single parcel of land,

permission is obtained from the public works director or the director's
designee for any other arrangement of a temporary or permanent connection to
the facility. (Ord. 3048, 2020: Ord. 2836 § 1, 2008)
13.16.100: INSTALLATION AND EXTENSION OF SEWER MAINS:
   A.   Whenever any person develops or builds upon any property within the
City and the City requires the extension and installation of sewer mains to
serve the property, all costs associated with the extension and installation
shall be borne by the person seeking to build or develop. After final
acceptance as set forth below, all such sewer mains and appurtenances shall be
deemed a part of the sanitary sewer and shall be maintained by the City.
   B.   All such sewer main extensions and installations shall be located in
dedicated public right-of-way areas and shall extend the full length of the
frontage of the property being served. The Superintendent may require or allow
sewer mains to be installed in utility easements if he deems it necessary for
the good of the sanitary sewer. All sewer main extensions/installations shall
conform in all respects to the standards, specifications, and material
requirements set forth by the City.
   C.   No such installation shall be deemed complete until inspected,
approved, and accepted by the Superintendent for maintenance by the City;
provided, however, that final acceptance shall not occur until the installation
has shown two (2) years of satisfactory service after approval. The person
developing or building shall be required to maintain, repair, and/or alter the
installation until such final acceptance is obtained. Thereafter, the sewer
mains shall be considered to have been dedicated to the City by said person as
part of the sanitary sewer and shall be maintained by the City.
   D.   All sewer main extensions and appurtenant equipment which have been
installed in private roadways or property shall be and remain the private
property of the persons, their heirs, successors or assigns, owning said
property, and shall be maintained by them, unless a specific written agreement
with the City makes other provisions. Provided, however, that the
Superintendent may authorize repair or maintenance work on private sections
only in an emergency situation where the public welfare may be endangered.

shall also include the replacement of street, curb and gutter, sidewalk or any
other public improvement disturbed by the repair of any private sewer,
including the service connection or tap. No person shall construct, relay,
repair or extend any private sewer, including the service connection or tap,
until the person doing the same obtains a private sewer permit from the City
Building Department.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to extend any private sewer beyond the
limits of the building or property for which a permit has been given without
obtaining an additional permit for the desired extension. The existence of a
private sewer permit shall in no way be construed as making permissible any
work for which an excavation permit may be required as set forth in this Code.
   C.   Any replacement of sanitary sewer piping serving any and all fixtures
which have flood level rim located below the elevation of the next upstream
manhole cover of any public or private sewer shall be protected from backflow
of sewage by installing an approved type of full house backwater valve. (Ord.
2836 § 1, 2008)

Notice shall be given the City by any person desiring to make connection with
any sanitary sewer at least five (5) hours previous to the time of making such
connection, stating when such work will be ready for inspection. The connection
must be made to the satisfaction of the City before the trench is filled. When
any person desires to lay or drive any pipe in a street, alley, or easement in
which a public or private sewer is laid, he shall give at least twenty four
(24) hours' notice to the City. (Ord. 2836 § 1, 2008)
13.16.140: REVOCATION OF PERMISSION TO CONNECT:
   A.   Permission given to connect sewers and drains shall be upon the express
condition that the City may at any time revoke the same and the person making
such connection, or his successor in interest, shall have no right to claim any
damage in consequence of such permission being revoked. Once service has been
connected, permission to connect may be revoked and water/sewer service
suspended for any violation of this chapter.
   B.   Written notice of such revocation of permission shall be served or
mailed at least seven (7) days prior to suspending water/sewer service. Such
notice shall state the date on which service is to be suspended and the right
to request in writing a pretermination hearing. In the event water service has
not begun, notice shall be sent in accordance with this section and no water
service shall be started. This hearing will be held before the Superintendent,
or in his/her absence the Mayor; provided, that the written request is received
by the Superintendent one day prior to the proposed suspension date.
   C.   Upon receipt of such a timely request, the Superintendent or the Mayor
shall give written notice to the party requesting the hearing as to the date,
time and place of the hearing, which hearing will be held not sooner than five
(5) days from the date of request. The Superintendent or the Mayor shall make a
record of any pretermination hearing which either of them conducts and shall,
within ten (10) days of the hearing, render a decision in writing, giving
reasons for the determination.
   D.   In the absence of a request for a pretermination hearing, or if an
adverse decision is rendered against the party requesting the hearing, the City
shall revoke permission to connect sewers and drains and shall not begin and/or
reinstate water service. Permission to connect sewers and drains shall not be
reinstated until the violation(s) has been corrected and the person(s) seeking
permission to connect is again complying with this chapter. (Ord. 2836 § 1,
2008)

property, equipment, manholes, piping, or appliances of the wastewater
collection system and treatment facilities. No person shall open any sanitary
sewer manhole without the permission of the Superintendent, nor shall any
person deposit any type of refuse into the sewer manholes. (Ord. 2836 § 1,
2008)
13.16.180: SANITARY SEWER USERS:
Any user shall be required to comply with all the provisions of this chapter
and
chapter 13.20 of this title. In addition, a user may be required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit from the City containing provisions for use of the
City sanitary sewer. If the city's public works director or the director's
designee finds that an owner has failed to comply with the provisions of this
chapter, the public works director or the director's designee may serve written
notice on the owner or person in control of the real property informing that
person of the section of the code with which the owner or person in control of
the real property needs to comply. Said notice shall also give the person or
entity thirty (30) days in which to bring the subject property into compliance.

13.20.010: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect discharges
of pollutants from nondomestic sources into the publicly owned treatment works
(POTW), including wastewater collection and treatment system, hauled septage
waste and stormwater drainage system; and enables the city to comply with the
administrative provisions of the clean water act (33 USC 1251 et seq.), as
amended, the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR 403), and the applicable
effluent limitations, national standards and any other discharge criteria which
are required or authorized by state or federal law. The objectives of this
chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   C.   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is
maintained at a level which allows the use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
   D.   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge
in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
   E.   To preserve the hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
   F.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the POTW.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter provides for
the regulation of direct and indirect discharge to the POTW through the
issuance of discharge permits to certain nondomestic users and through
enforcement of general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, establishes administrative review procedures, requires
user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. (Ord. 2837
§ 1, 2008)
13.20.015: ADMINISTRATION:
Except as otherwise provided herein, the superintendent shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or
duties imposed upon the superintendent may be delegated by the superintendent
to other city personnel. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.020: DEFINITIONS:
Unless a provision explicitly states otherwise, the following terms and
phrases, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings hereinafter
designated:
   ACT OR THE ACT: The federal water pollution control act, also known as the
clean water act, as amended, 33 USC 1251 et seq.
   APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARD: For any specified pollutant, city
prohibitive standard, city specific pretreatment standards (local limits),
state of Idaho pretreatment standards, or EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards, whichever standard is appropriate or most stringent.
   APPROVAL AUTHORITY: The administrator of Idaho DEQ.
   AUTHORIZED OR DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE USER: A. If the user is
a corporation:
      1.   The president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision making functions for the corporation; or
      2.   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operation
facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make management decisions
which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having explicit
or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations and
initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long term
environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure
that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete
and accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures;
   B.   If the user is a partnership or sole proprietorship, a general partner
or proprietor, respectively;
   C.   If the user is a federal, state, or local governmental facility, a
director or highest official appointed or designated to oversee the operation
and performance of the activities of the government facility, or his/her
designee; and
   D.   A duly authorized representative is an individual designated by the
responsible officer, manager, sole proprietor or general partner in writing.
The written authorization must be submitted to the city and also specify either
an individual or a position having the responsibility of the overall operation
of the facility from which the industrial discharge originates, such as the
position of the plant manager, operator of a well, or well field
superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company. If an authorization
in this definition is no longer accurate because a different individual or
position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or
overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new
authorization satisfying the requirements of this definition must be submitted
to the city prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative.
   BATCH DISCHARGE: Any single discharge that is specifically allowed under a
wastewater discharge permit and that requires the prior written approval of the
superintendent before discharge to the POTW.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OR BMPS: Schedules of activities, prohibitions of
practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to implement
the prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and (b). BMPs also include
treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant
site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw
materials storage.
   BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD): The quantity of oxygen utilized in the
biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedures
for five (5) days at twenty degrees Celsius (20°C), usually expressed as a
concentration of milligrams per liter (mg/l).
   CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD OR CATEGORICAL STANDARD: Any regulation
containing pollutant discharge limits promulgated by EPA in accordance with
sections 307(b) and (c) of the act (33 USC 1317) which applies to a specific
category of users and which appears in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts
405-471.
   CATEGORICAL USER: A user regulated by one of EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards.
   CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND OR COD: A measure of the oxygen required to oxidize
all compounds, both organic and inorganic, in water.
   CITY: The city of Pocatello, Idaho, the city council, the POTW, the city
water pollution control superintendent, or his or her duly authorized deputy,
representative or agent, or "control authority" as defined herein or in 40 CFR
403.
   CLEAN WATER ACT: The federal water pollution control act, as amended (33 USC
1251 et seq.).
   COLOR: The optical density at the visual wave length of maximum absorption
relative to distilled water. One hundred percent (100%) transmittance is
equivalent to zero (0.0) optical density.
   COMPOSITE SAMPLE: A sample made up of a mixture of discrete samples (minimum
12) collected at the same sampling point at equal intervals over a twenty four
(24) hour period, with each interval not to exceed two (2) hours. In a flow
proportioned composite sample, the discrete portions are varied according to
flow. Where the flow is not continuous over a twenty four (24) hour period,
portions shall be collected at equal intervals over the period of discharge.
Each aliquot shall be a grab sample of not less than one hundred milliliters
(100 ml) and shall be collected and preserved in accordance with 40 CFR 136,
and amendments. Sample volume at the completion of each twenty four (24) hour
period shall include enough sample volume to perform all analyses required by
the city.
The city interprets a "day" to be a twenty four (24) hour period and does not
require that it occur within a calendar day. This is consistent with the
definition for "daily discharge" in the IPDES regulations at 40 CFR 122.2.
   CONTAMINANT: Any substance that is discharged to the POTW other than clean
drinking water and/or storm and surface water runoff.
   CONTROL AUTHORITY: The city of Pocatello, the city council, the POTW, the
city water pollution control superintendent, or his or her duly authorized
deputy, representative or agent.
   COOLING WATER/NONCONTACT COOLING WATER: Water used for cooling which does
not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste
product, or finished product. Cooling water may be generated from any use, such
as air conditioning, heat exchangers, cooling or refrigeration to which the
only pollutant added is heat.
   DAILY MAXIMUM LIMIT: The maximum allowable discharge limit of a pollutant
during a calendar day. Where the daily maximum limits are expressed in units of
mass, the daily discharge is the total mass discharged over the course of the
day. Where the daily maximum limits are expressed in terms of concentration,
the daily discharge is the arithmetic average measurement of the pollutant
concentration derived from all measurements taken that day.
   DOMESTIC USER (RESIDENTIAL USER): Any person who contributes, causes or
allows the contribution of wastewater into the POTW that is of a similar volume
and/or chemical makeup as that of a residential dwelling unit. Discharges from
single- or multi- family dwellings, from office buildings or from commercial
establishments, factories, and institutions which originate from toilet
facilities, baths, or kitchens (provided there is no commercial preparation of
foods), free from stormwater, surface water, and industrial or other process
water. Discharges from a residential dwelling unit typically include up to one
hundred (100) gallons per capita per day, 0.2 pound of BOD per capita per day,
and 0.17 pound of TSS per capita per day.
   DOMESTIC WASTE: Water carrying human wastes, including kitchen wastes, bath
wastes, and laundry wastes that are typical of residential discharges, but does
not include industrial wastes.
   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA): The U.S. environmental protection
agency or, where appropriate, the director or the region 10 office of water, or
other duly authorized official of said agency.
   EXISTING SOURCE: A categorical industrial user, the construction or
operation of whose facility commenced prior to the publication by EPA of
proposed categorical pretreatment standards, which would be applicable to such
source if and when the standard is thereafter promulgated in accordance with
section 307 of the act.
   EXISTING USER: Any noncategorical user which was discharging wastewater
prior to the effective date hereof.
   GRAB SAMPLE: An individual sample collected over a period of time not
exceeding fifteen (15) minutes.
   INDIRECT DISCHARGE OR DISCHARGE: The introduction of pollutants into the
POTW from any nondomestic source regulated under section 307(b), (c), or (d) of
the act. The discharge into the POTW is normally by means of pipes, conduits,
pumping stations, force mains, constructed drainage ditches, surface water
intercepting ditches, and all constructed devices and appliances appurtenant
thereto.
   INDUSTRIAL WASTE: Any liquid, solids, or gaseous substance, or combination
thereof, resulting from or used in connection with any process of industry,
manufacturing, commercial food processing, business, agriculture, trade or
research, including, but not limited to, development, recovering or processing
of natural resources, and leachate from landfills or other disposal sites.
   INSTANTANEOUS LIMIT: The maximum concentration of a pollutant allowed to be
discharged at any time, determined from the analysis of any discrete or
composite sample collected, independent of the industrial flow rate and the
duration of the sampling event.
   INTERFERENCE:A discharge that alone, or in conjunction with a discharge or
discharges from other sources: a) inhibits or disrupts the POTW, its treatment
processes or operations; b) inhibits or disrupts its sludge processes, use or
disposal; or c) is a cause of a violation of the city's IPDES permit or of the
prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal in compliance with any of the
following statutory/regulatory provisions or permits issued thereunder, or more
stringent state or local regulations: section 405 of the clean water act; the
solid waste disposal act (SWDA), including title II commonly referred to as the
resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA); any state regulations contained
in any state sludge management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of the
SWDA; the clean air act; the toxic substances control act; and the marine
protection, research, and sanctuaries act.
   IPDES PERMIT: The city’s Idaho pollutant discharge elimination system
permit.
   LOCAL LIMIT: Specific discharge limits developed and enforced by the city
upon nonresidential users to implement the general and specific discharge
prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and (b).
   MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DISCHARGE LIMIT: The maximum concentration (or loading) of
a pollutant allowed to be discharged at any time, determined from the analysis
of any discrete or composite sample collected, independent of the industrial
flow rate and the duration of the sampling event.
   MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE HEADWORKS: The maximum loading of a pollutant that can be
received at the POTW's headworks without causing pass-through, interference,
interfere with beneficial reuse of sludge, or cause an adverse effect on worker
health.
   MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INDUSTRIAL LOADING (MAIL): The total mass of a pollutant
that all industrial users (or a subgroup of industrial users as identified by
the city) may discharge pursuant to the local limits developed under 40 CFR
section 403.5(c).
   MEDICAL WASTES: Isolation wastes, infectious agents, human blood and blood
products, pathological wastes, sharps, body parts, contaminated bedding,
surgical wastes, potentially contaminated laboratory wastes, and dialysis
wastes.
   MONTHLY AVERAGE: The sum of all "daily discharges" measured during a
calendar month divided by the number of "daily discharges" measured during that
month.
   MONTHLY AVERAGE LIMIT: The highest allowable average of "daily discharges"
over a calendar month, calculated as the sum of all "daily discharges" measured
during a calendar month divided by the number of "daily discharges" measured
during that month.
   NEW SOURCE: A. Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which
there is (or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed categorical pretreatment standards
under section 307(c) of the act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided
that:
      1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at
a site at which no other source is located; or
      2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection A2 or A3 of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
   C.   Construction of a new source as defined herein has commenced if the
owner or operator has:
      1.   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site
construction program:
          a.   Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or
equipment; or
         b.   Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation,
or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary
for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or
equipment; or
      2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which is intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering,
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
subsection C2.
   NEW USER: A user that is not regulated under federal categorical
pretreatment standards but applies to the city for a building permit or
occupies an existing building and plans to commence discharge of wastewater to
the POTW after the effective date hereof. Any person that buys an existing
facility that is discharging nondomestic wastewater will be considered an
"existing user" if no significant changes are made in the manufacturing
operation.
   PASS-THROUGH: A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United
States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a
discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any
requirement of the city of Pocatello's IPDES permit, including an increase in
the magnitude or duration of a violation.
   PERMITTEE: A person or user issued a wastewater discharge permit.
   PERSON: Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company,
corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental
entity, or any other legal entity; or their legal representatives, agents, or
assigns. This definition includes all federal, state, or local governmental
entities.
pH: The negative logarithm of the effective hydrogen-ion concentration or
hydrogen activity in gram equivalents per liter used in expressing both acidity
and alkalinity on a scale whose values run from 0 to 14, with 7 representing
neutrality, numbers less than 7 increasing acidity, and numbers greater than 7
increasing alkalinity.
   POLLUTANT: Any dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, filter
backwash, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, medical wastes, chemical
wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or
discharged equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt, municipal, agricultural and
industrial wastes, and certain characteristics of the wastewater (e.g., pH,
temperature, TSS, turbidity, color, BOD, COD, toxicity, or odor).
   POLLUTANT OF CONCERN (POC): Any pollutant that is present in concentrations
or mass that may reasonably be expected to cause pass-through, interference or
impact another environmental standard evaluated in the development of local
limits.
   PRETREATMENT: The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical, or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means, except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard.
   PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENT: Any substantive or procedural requirement related
to pretreatment imposed on a user, other than a pretreatment standard.
   PRETREATMENT STANDARDS OR STANDARDS: Prohibited discharge standards,
categorical pretreatment standards, and local limits and/or BMPs established by
the POTW.
   PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS OR PROHIBITED DISCHARGES: Absolute
prohibitions against the discharge of certain substances which appear in
section
13.20.030 of this chapter.
   PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW): A "treatment works", as defined by
section 212 of the act (33 USC 1292), which is owned by the city. This
definition includes any devices or systems used in the collection, storage,
treatment, recycling, and reclamation of sewage or industrial wastes of a
liquid nature and any conveyances which convey wastewater to a treatment plant.
This term also means the city.
   SEPTAGE TANK WASTE: Any sewage from holding tanks such as vessels,
cesspools, chemical toilets, campers, trailers and septic tanks, or similar
system that receives only domestic waste.
   SEWAGE: Human excrement and gray water (household showers, dishwashing
operations, etc.).
   SEWER (SANITARY SEWER): The portions of the POTW which are designated by the
superintendent to carry, treat, or dispose of wastewater not constituting storm
or surface water permitted by or under this chapter to enter the POTW.
   SHALL, MAY: "Shall" is mandatory; "may" is permissive.
   SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER: Except as provided in subsection C of this
definition, a significant industrial user is:
   A.   A user subject to categorical pretreatment standards; or
   B.   A user that:
      1.   Discharges an average of twenty five thousand (25,000) gpd or more
of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling, and
boiler blowdown wastewater);
      2.   Contributes a process wastestream which makes up five percent (5%)
or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW
treatment plant; or
      3.   Is designated as such by the city on the basis that it has a

(Ord. 3125 § 1, 2023: Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.035: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The national categorical pretreatment standards as amended and promulgated by
the EPA pursuant to the act and as found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N,
parts 405-471, are hereby incorporated and shall be enforceable under this
chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.040: STATE REQUIREMENTS:
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by
all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this
chapter or in other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.045: LOCAL LIMITS:
   A.   Pollutant Limits To Protect Against Pass-Through And Interference: The
following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass-through and
interference. No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater
containing pollutant levels in excess of the following daily maximum allowable
discharge limits:
Pollutant Daily Maximum (mg/l)1
Pollutant                  Daily Maximum (mg/l)1
Arsenic                    0.05
Cadmium                    0.028
Chromium                   3.2

Silver                     0.62
Zinc                       1.87
Oil and grease:             
Animal and vegetable based 350
Petroleum based            100
pH minimum (S.U.)          6.0
pH maximum (S.U.)          10.0
 
   Notes:
       1.    Pollutants are total and in mg/l unless otherwise specified.
   B.   Toxic Organic Management Plan (TOMP): Users with wastewater that may
contain any of the toxic pollutants listed in 40 CFR 122, appendix D table II
or pollutants that may be reasonably expected to be present shall, as part of
the permit process, report the analyses for the toxic pollutants. If any of the
toxic pollutants are found in the analyses, then the user may be required to
continue to monitor for those toxic pollutants or the user may be allowed by
the city to develop a TOMP in lieu of periodically monitoring for those toxic
pollutants. The user must routinely submit a certification statement as part of
its periodic self-monitoring report which asserts that there has been an
increase in the discharge over previously reported amounts.
   C.   Applicability: The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater
is discharged to the POTW (end of pipe). The superintendent may impose mass
limitations in addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations
above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit of applicable
pretreatment standard shall apply.
   D.   Other Pollutant Limits: The following limits shall apply to wastewaters
that are discharged from the groundwater cleanup of petroleum or gasoline
underground storage tanks or other remediation wastewaters containing these
pollutants or where these pollutants are appropriate surrogates. It shall be
unlawful for any industrial user to discharge or cause to be discharged any
waste or wastewater to the POTW that exceeds the following limits, as
applicable:
 
Pollutant Daily Maximum Limit (mg/l)1
Benzene   0.050
BTEX2     0.750
 
   Notes:
       1.    All pollutants shown in the table are total.
       2.    BTEX shall be measured as the sum of benzene, ethylbenzene,
toluene and xylenes.
   E.   Where possible and appropriate the city may establish and implement
industry-specific BMPs (best management practices) in conjunction with or in
lieu of numerical local limits. Such BMPs shall be considered pretreatment
standards and are fully enforceable under this chapter. Based upon assessment
of need and on a user specific basis, the city may incorporate pollutant
specific BMPs or concentration or mass limits into indirect discharge permits.
Wherever a user is subject to both a categorical pretreatment standard and a
local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or pretreatment
standards shall apply. (Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2925, 2013)
13.20.050: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.055: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a
special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or
a federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net/gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. Users
may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the
approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. Such a request will be
approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when
establishing that pretreatment standard. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.060: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which he
believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.065: LIMITATIONS ON POINT OF DISCHARGE:
No user shall discharge any waste or wastewater directly into a manhole or
other opening unless they have been issued a permit by the city. If a permit is
issued for such discharge, the user shall pay the applicable charges and fees
and shall meet all conditions required by the permit. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.070: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city
before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under
the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.075: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards
shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city
shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not
covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when
the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the federal
categorical pretreatment standard.
New source and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have
in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall contain a
compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical
pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or categorical user that must
comply with a more stringent local limit which is in noncompliance with any
local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule included in the
wastewater discharge permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time
feasible. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.080: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sanitary sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   C.   A grease interceptor or a grease trap is not considered to be properly
maintained if for any reason it is not in good working condition with all
internal required plumbing of proper design and length in place, or if the
operational fluid capacity has been reduced by more than twenty five percent
(25%) by the accumulation of floating and settled solids, oils, and greases.
The owner of any premises required to install a grease interceptor; the lessee
and sublessee, if there be such; and any proprietor, operator, or
superintendent of such facility are individually and severally liable for any
failure of proper maintenance of such grease interceptor.
If the grease interceptor is not maintained adequately under the conditions of
use, the grease interceptor shall be resized and the user shall install one
which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose.
When a grease interceptor/trap is cleaned, the sidewalls shall be scraped and
hosed down, while all the solids and liquids contained are removed. All wastes
removed from any grease interceptor/trap shall be legally disposed of other
than to the sewer. The city of Pocatello specifically prohibits the following
grease interceptor/trap practices:
      1.   Pumping to remove only accumulated sediments or floating materials;
      2.   Pumping operations which specifically separate floating or sediment
interceptor solid wastes from wastewater and then return or decant the
separated wastewater back into the grease interceptor/trap;
      3.   Transporting any hauled pollutants from another location for
discharge into a grease interceptor/trap.
      4.   Use of grease interceptor/trap treatment products, including
bacteria, designed to digest the grease, is specifically prohibited.
   D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.085: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by
the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of
pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city
for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which
user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within
sixty (60) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its
ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved
by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility
as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill
prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of accidental or slug
discharges. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would
violate any of the standards in sections
13.20.030 through
13.20.045 of this chapter; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug
discharges. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Users shall notify the city wastewater treatment plant immediately
after the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated
by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW,
in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under state or federal law.
   C.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's
premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. (Ord. 2837
§ 1, 2008)
13.20.090: SEPTIC TANK WASTE:
   A.   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at the
designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, located at
10733 N. Rio Vista Road, and at such times as are established by the
superintendent. No other point of discharge within the city's collection system
will be allowed without the expressed written permission of the superintendent.
The discharge of any hauled waste to a point in the city's collection system,
other than as specifically designated by the superintendent, shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations and shall be subject to enforcement action. Such
wastes shall not violate any section of this chapter or any other requirements
established or adopted by the city.
   B.   All domestic septic tank waste, portable toilet waste or other hauled
waste deemed acceptable by the superintendent will be subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the city's general regulations of waste haulers,
incorporated herein and made a part hereof.
   C.   Discharges of nondomestic hauled waste shall be subject to the
applicable prohibited discharges as set forth in sections
13.20.030 through
13.20.045 of this chapter, as well as any applicable federal, state and local
regulations governing hauled waste or any conditions the superintendent deems
necessary for protection of its treatment works.
   D.   Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as being
preemptory of any other regulations governing hauled waste, or waste haulers,
or any business activities pertaining to hauled waste, or as set forth in any
federal, state or local guidance governing hauled waste.
   E.   Any waste hauler seeking to discharge hauled waste to the POTW, or to
any designated point within the city collection system, must have a city
approved waste hauler's permit. No load may be discharged without prior consent
of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each hauled
load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The
superintendent may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge. The superintendent reserves the right to refuse permission
to dump any load that is suspected of being incompatible or that is determined
to be incompatible with the POTW through sampling and analysis, or sound
professional judgment.
   F.   Waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every load. A
waste tracking form approved by the POTW shall be used to record every load
that is delivered to the POTW. Failure to accurately record every load,
falsification of data or failure to transmit the form to the superintendent
prior to discharge into the POTW may result in revocation of this permit.
   G.   Fees for dumping hauled wastes shall be charged each time a waste
hauler delivers or causes to be delivered a load for discharge, based on tank

commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source or
a new user considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, any user
subject to this chapter shall submit to the city a report containing the
information outlined in sections
13.20.120 and
13.20.170 of this chapter.
   B.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. (Ord. 2837 §
1, 2008)
13.20.180: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT:
Any users may be required to submit periodic compliance reports by permit or at
the request of the superintendent.
   A.   All significant industrial users shall comply with all applicable
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12 and submit to the city during the months of
June and December, unless required on other dates or more frequency by the
city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous
reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the
industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their
discharge at least twice per year. In cases where best management practice
(BMP) or pollution prevention alternatives are required, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the applicable pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   B.   The report shall include a record of the concentration (and mass if
specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the
wastewater discharge permit that were measured and record of all flow
measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations
and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or
wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required by
the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average concentration
(or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled and analyzed
more frequently than what was required by the city or by this chapter, using
methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
   C.   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable
categorical pretreatment standards shall report production data as outlined in
section
13.20.175 of this chapter.
   D.   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or
nonregulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the
regulated process flows, dilution flows, and nonregulated flows.
   E.   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual
measurement is not feasible.
   F.   Discharges sampled shall be representative of the user's daily
operation and samples shall be taken in accordance with the requirements
specified in sections
13.20.225 and
13.20.230 of this chapter.
   G.   The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have
an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to
establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent, or
determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of
the sewer system.
   H.   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by
the user, the city may agree to perform periodic compliance monitoring needed
to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the
city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the
user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the
sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer
charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no
obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.
   I.   The city may authorize an Industrial User subject to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the Industrial User. [See 40 CFR 403.12(e) (2)] This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      2.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit.
      3.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      4.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed and include the
certification statement in accordance with Section
13.20.125 of this chapter. (40 CFR 403.6(a) (2) (ii)).
      5.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      6.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the superintendent must be
included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the superintendent for 5 years after expiration of the waiver.
      7.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's
permit by the superintendent], the Industrial User must certify on each report
with the statement in Section
13.20.125, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the Industrial User.
      8.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's operations,
the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of Section
13.20.180.A, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
superintendent, and notify the superintendent.
      9.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standards. (Ord. 3125 § 5,
2023: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.185: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
   B.   No increment referred to in subsection A of this section shall exceed
nine (9) months.
   C.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to
the city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.190: NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES:
Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two (2) business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the calendar month. Any user not providing a notice
of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits
contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
   A.   The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section
13.20.120 of this chapter.
   B.   The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
section
13.20.165 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under section
 13.20.150 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.195: HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION:
Any user that is discharging more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous
wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar
month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide notification
in writing to the city and a onetime notification in writing to the EPA region
10 office of air, waste, and toxics director, and to the state of Idaho
department of environmental quality hazardous waste manager within ten (10)
days of discovery that said discharge occurred. Any existing user exempt from
this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within
thirty (30) days of becoming aware of a discharge of fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any discharge of acutely hazardous
wastes to the POTW.
Such notification shall include:
   A.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
   B.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
   C.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
   D.   If an industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms
of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily
available to the industrial user:
      1.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes,
      2.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month, and
      3.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements.
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes
or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the
discharge of such a substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this section, an industrial user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise
permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal, state and local law. (Ord. 2837 §
1, 2008)
13.20.200: NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL SPILLS, SLUG
LOADS:
   A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the user. Any user who discharges a slug load of pollutants shall be liable for
any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any
fines imposed on the city under federal, state or local law.
   B.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   D.   Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.205: NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis for two (2)
consecutive days, within five (5) days of becoming aware of the violation. The
results of the repeat analysis shall be submitted to the city within thirty
(30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the city has performed
the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city must perform
the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation
and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not
required if:
   A.   The city performs sampling and analysis at the user at a frequency of
at least once per month, or
   B.   The city performs sampling and analysis at the user between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city
receives the results of this sampling analysis. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.210: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE:
All users shall notify the POTW ninety (90) days in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge. This
includes significant manufacturing process modifications, pretreatment
modifications, facility expansion, production increase, and the listed
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial
notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.215: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the city as the superintendent may require. (Ord. 2837 §
1, 2008)
13.20.220: RECORD KEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include
the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person
(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses including documentation associated with best management practices.
These records shall remain available for a period of at least five (5) years.
This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the user or the POTW, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent. (Ord. 3032, 2019:
Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.225: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city. The samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or
facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and
403.12(h), the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary
to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   C.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment
facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by
the city and specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For
categorical users, if other wastestreams are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40
CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. For other users, for which the city has adjusted its
local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s).
   D.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling
and methods of analysis and shall certify that the wastestream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in
its individual wastewater discharge permit using methodologies in 40 CFR 136,
it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of
its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.230: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.235: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections
 13.20.225 and
13.20.230 of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.245: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING; RIGHT OF ENTRY:
The city shall have the right to enter the facility of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder is being met and whether the user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   D.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.250: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring
facility to allow inspections, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's
premises, except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed
in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located
so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The
superintendent, whenever applicable, may require the construction and
maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end
of a manufacturing line or a wastewater treatment system).
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
including the sampling and measuring equipment, shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   The superintendent may require the user to install equipment as
necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
If flow measurement is required, the appropriate flow measurement devices and
methods consistent with approved scientific practices must be selected and used
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of measurement of the volume of
monitored discharges. All devices must be installed, calibrated, and maintained
to ensure that the accuracy of the measurements is consistent with the accepted
capability of that type of device. All devices selected must be capable of
measuring flows with a maximum deviation of less than ten percent (10%) from
true discharge rates throughout the range of expected discharge volumes. (Ord.
3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.255: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the superintendent shall seek
issuance of a search warrant from the district court of the sixth judicial
district in and for the county where the property is situated. Such warrant
shall be served by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the city. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.260: VANDALISM, FALSIFYING, OR TAMPERING:
No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter.
No person shall make any false statement, representation or certification in
any application, record, report or plan, or other document filed or required to
be maintained pursuant to this chapter. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord.
2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.265: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, and monitoring programs, and from the
superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the IPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and
will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord.
2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.270: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The superintendent shall publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. Accordingly, the industrial user shall be apprised
that noncompliance with this chapter and its wastewater discharge permit may
lead to an enforcement action and may result in publication of its name in an
appropriate newspaper in accordance with this section. For the purposes of this
provision, a user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or
more of the following criteria:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of measurements taken for the
same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the TRC (TRC
equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous
limits, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutant that may cause imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to provide within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation or groups of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.  (Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.275: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.280: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
13.20.290 and
 13.20.295 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a
consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.285: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user as defined in section
13.20.020 of this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.290: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.295: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.300: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service
charge and the superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as may
be available for other service charges and fees.
   C.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty percent (20%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the highest legal rate allowed
by law. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
   D.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request to the
public works director for reconsideration of the fine along with full payment
of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. The
public works director may convene a hearing on the matter within thirty (30)
days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   E.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1,
2008)
13.20.305: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge without formal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents,
or may present, an endangerment to city workers, the general public, and/or to
the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sanitary sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent shall
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in section
13.20.310 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
13.20.285 and
13.20.310 of this chapter.
   C.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.310: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE, NONEMERGENCY:
In addition to the provisions in section
 13.20.160 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections
 13.20.030 through
13.20.045 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
13.20.285 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.315: APPEAL OF SHOW CAUSE HEARING DECISION, COMPLIANCE ORDER, CEASE AND
DESIST ORDER, OR NONEMERGENCY TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
Any interested person, including the user, may petition to the city council for
reconsideration of a show cause hearing decision, a compliance order, a cease
and desist order, or a nonemergency termination of discharge within ten (10)
days of the issuance of said decision or order.
   A.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the administrative appeal.
   B.   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the decision being
objected to, the reasons for this objection and an alternative proposal, if
any, it seeks to be applied to the wastewater discharge permit.
   C.   The effectiveness of the decision, order or termination regarding the
wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
   D.   If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days from the receipt of a
petition for review, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be
denied. Decisions not to reconsider a show cause hearing decision, a compliance
order, a cease and desist order or a nonemergency termination order of a
wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative action for
purposes of judicial review.
   E.   Aggrieved parties seeking review of the final administrative wastewater
discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the district
court of the sixth judicial district in and for the county of Bannock within
two (2) years from the date of said final decision. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.317: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may petition the district court of the sixth judicial district
in and for the county of Bannock through the city's attorney for the issuance
of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or
compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city
may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.320: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum
civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In
the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user,
the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.325: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user who has wilfully or negligently violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than six (6) months, or both.
   B.   A user who wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and/or be subject to imprisonment for six (6)
months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under state law.
   C.   A user who knowingly made any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) months, or both. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.330: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent
reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement in response to pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken
concurrently. (Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.335: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.340: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.345: PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES:
The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this chapter, a previous
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. (Ord. 2837 §
1, 2008)
13.20.350: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed.
Service will recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.355: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of this code governing such nuisances, including
reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying
said nuisance. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.360: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
   F.   Upon reduction of efficiency of operation, or loss or failure of all or
part of the treatment facility, the industrial user must, to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter and its wastewater discharge
permit, control its production or discharges (or both) until operation of the
treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. Such a requirement applies, for example, when the primary source of
power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced. It will not be a defense
for an industrial user in an enforcement action to argue it was not feasible to
halt or reduce the activity to maintain compliance with its wastewater permit.
(Ord. 3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.365: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS; DEFENSE:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section
13.20.030 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its IPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. (Ord.
3032, 2019: Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.370: BYPASS:
   A.   Defined Terms: For the purposes of this section, the following terms
are defined as follows:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   Acceptable Bypass Conditions: A user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this
section.
   C.   Bypass Notification:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   Bypass Prohibited; Exceptions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)
13.20.375: PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES:
The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and
operating the city's pretreatment program which may include:
   A.   Fees for wastewater discharge permit including the cost of processing
such applications;
   B.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including
the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing
monitoring reports and certification statements submitted by users;
   C.   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction of pretreatment facilities and sewer connections;
   D.   Fees for filing appeals;
   E.   Fees to recover administrative and legal costs associated with the
enforcement activity taken by the superintendent to address user noncompliance;
and
   F.   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements
contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this
chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable
by the city. (Ord. 2837 § 1, 2008)

13.28.080: REGULATIONS FOR GARBAGE/REFUSE HAULING, HAULING OF OTHER ITEMS, AND
RECYCLING OPERATIONS:
   A.   The City or its duly authorized contractor is the sole proprietor to
collect and dispose of all garbage/refuse within the city limits. An exception
may be granted by the director or manager to allow private contractors the
ability to collect and dispose of their own garbage/refuse while in the process

is held to ensure adequate care of the city issued containers so as to prevent
damage, vandalism or loss. The costs of replacing containers whose damage or
loss was not incurred during the collector's pick up process shall be assessed
to the account holder and added to the refuse collection portion of the utility
bill.
   H.   All refuse must be fully contained within approved receptacles for
collection. All materials placed for recycling must be neatly and adequately
secured for collection by means approved by the sanitation director or manager.
The failure of any manager, owner, tenant, or other person in charge of a
premises which generates garbage, or is the location for materials set out for
recycling, to adequately contain or secure refuse or materials for recycling
shall be considered to be a violation of this section and will be subject to
special pick-up charges in accordance to current policy, and/or a separate
misdemeanor citation may be issued for each day on which the violation
continues. (Ord. 3130 § 5, 2023: Ord. 2636 § 8, 1999: Ord. 2143 § 9, 1984:

costs associated with the utility service, whether or not he is the owner of
the premises.
   OWNER: The owner of the premises receiving utility services, whether person,
firm, corporation, partnership, or joint venture. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.020: AUTHORITY AND DUTIES:
Billing and collection for city utility services, including water, refuse
collection, and sewer services charges, and any attendant setup, transfer,
processing and billing fees and deposits shall be accomplished by the utility
billing department, which shall also establish and maintain accurate accounts
and records for these utilities, receipt monies paid for these services and
deposit them with the city treasurer. The city treasurer shall establish
capital reserve accounts consisting of percentages of gross revenue sufficient
for each utility as specified by the city council, and ascertain that revenues
are accurately apportioned among the funds and the reserve accounts. Procedures
for establishing accounts, revocation of service, level pay plans, continuous
service agreements, vacancy declarations, and deactivation requests shall be

and procedures made available for public inspection in the department. (Ord.
2652, 2000)
13.30.030: GENERAL BILLING PROCEDURES:
Billings for utility services shall be made monthly, with charges for each
service listed separately on the bill. Rates and charges shall be as set by
resolution of the city council or this chapter. All account records shall be
kept by the premises street address, and shall include the account number
assigned thereto, the name of the owner or tenant, whether individual,
corporation, joint venture, or partnership, and shall be in the name of an
account holder, whether owner, tenant, or authorized representative, who shall
be the party responsible for payment. Prospective account holders shall be
required to complete an application for service for initiation or continuance
of service as set out below. If the owner is other than an individual, proof of
authorization for an individual to be designated as account holder shall be
required, that individual must complete the application for service and agree
to be designated as the person responsible for payments on behalf of the
entity. A tenant of any premises which has its own separate metered water
service may be listed as the account holder and shall be the responsible party
for payment of utility service charges if the said tenant completes the
application for service. Provided, however, that if any rental premises has a
history of account delinquencies, the utility billing director may require that
the owner of the premises become the account holder and be responsible for
payment. (Ord. 2903, 2011)
13.30.040: ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTS:
   A.   Application For Service: The utility billing department shall provide
application forms for water, sewer, and/or refuse collection services. The
owner of a premises, his/her authorized agent, or a tenant if authorized, shall
provide proof of identification and authorization from the owner, if
applicable, and complete the application for service in order for service(s) to
be established or transferred to a different name. Applications for service
must be updated when either the owner or the responsible party is changed for
any premises. Contractors or tenants of premises who do not have accounts in
their name for that premises but wish to have additional refuse service(s) at
the premises, may establish a separate account and receive service after
completing an application for service and paying any required fees or charges.
   B.   Fees And Deposits: The Utility Billing Department shall collect fees
for turning water service on and/or off, for transferring accounts, and such
other fees and deposits as set from time to time by resolution of the City
Council. If water service is available to the premises but is not on, a turn on
fee shall be charged and due with the first regular billing statement for the
premises. In the event water is still on at the premises, a transfer fee shall
be charged and due with the first regular billing statement for the premises.
Payment of a deposit may be required as determined by the Utility Billing
Director, or his/her designee based upon credit reporting information. A
deposit may be waived for accounts transferred to a new primary residence
within the City of Pocatello upon which timely payment has been made for two
(2) consecutive years. Additionally, if service was previously established in
the name of a spouse, and an ex-spouse, widow, or widower desires an account in
his/her own name, no fee shall be collected for the transaction. All deposits
shall be held as guarantee of payment. Upon termination of utility service, any
such deposit may be refunded to the party in whose name the account is listed,
less any sum which may be due the City. Provided, however, that if the customer
is moving to another service address, the final balance for the former service
address, less any deposit, if applicable, may be transferred from the
customer's former account and credited and/or charged to the new account. An
account holder owing a past due amount may not open a new service account until
the past due amount is paid in full. An account which is unpaid and/or sent for
collection shall be deemed to be an account which was shut off for nonpayment,
and neither a reinstatement of service nor a new service shall be provided
until all amounts owed and an applicable deposit have been paid. A reconnect/
nonpayment fee shall be charged on any account which was shut off for
nonpayment, and said fee shall be due with the first regular billing statement
thereafter.
   C.   Certificate Of Occupancy Required: No application for service shall be
granted, and no account shall be established for newly constructed premises,
additions, or major remodeling, until the owner/occupant has received a
certificate of occupancy from the Building Department and has submitted a copy
of it to the Utility Billing Department; provided, however, that a contractor
needing water service to the premises under construction may open a new
temporary account in his name for water only for a maximum of ninety (90) days
for residential construction or, in the case of commercial construction, for a
period as determined by the building official and Utility Billing Director. At
the end of that period, such temporary water service shall be terminated and
will not be reinstated without payment of the applicable turn on fee. If
necessary, the contractor may request extensions, prior to the expiration of
the period of temporary service, for an additional thirty (30) days each,
contingent upon inspection and written certification by the Building Department
that construction is still proceeding. After construction has been completed
and a certificate of occupancy issued, any such water only account may be
transferred to the name of the owner of the premises, and a regular utility
account established. In the event that any temporary certificate of occupancy
is revoked, or if a premises is found to be occupied without the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, the building official shall notify the Utility
Billing Director, the utility account will be terminated, and water service
will be shut off after proper notice to the occupant. (Ord. 2995, 2017: Ord.
2977, 2016: Ord. 2903, 2011: Ord. 2685 § 1, 2002: Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.050: CHARGES COMPUTED SEPARATELY FOR EACH METER:
If an individual consumer is supplied with water through more than one metered
service for the same address, charges shall be computed separately for each
individual meter, but billed on a single bill. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.060: MORE THAN ONE CONSUMER ON SINGLE METER:
If more than one individual consumer is supplied with water through one meter,
the owner who applies for service shall be responsible for all charges. (Ord.
2652, 2000)
13.30.070: LEVEL PAY PLAN:
An account holder who has received water service at the same premises for at
least twelve (12) consecutive months may request a level pay plan for utility
charges. The utility billing staff shall then total the previous year's
consumption charges and establish an average monthly charge to be used for
subsequent billings. The staff shall conduct annual checks and recalculate
level pay amounts annually in order to maintain a sufficient level of payment
to cover the utility charges. Regardless of usage, the full amount set as the
level payment shall be due every month during the twelve (12) month cycle. No
adjustments or refunds shall be allowed during any twelve (12) month level pay
cycle, unless an account has been finalized and a credit balance remains. If
there are any delinquencies in payment, or any insufficient funds check has
been presented for an account, the account's level pay option shall be canceled
and the regular billing process reinstated. (Ord. 2652, 2000)
13.30.080: ADJUSTMENTS:
Except as herein provided, no credits, reductions, or waivers of charges shall
be allowed for water or sewer services if water service is turned on at a
premises. The utility billing director or designee shall have the authority to
approve any applications or forms necessary for any of the following:
   A.   Circuit Breaker Reduction: The utility billing staff shall make the
reduction provided for in the utility rate resolutions set by the city council
for account holders whose names appear on the "circuit breaker exemption list"
of Bannock County, effective January 1 of each year. The reduction shall be
solely for the account holder's own residence.
   B.   Mobile Home Parks: If mobile home parks are provided with auto cart
service, when a lot/pad becomes vacant, i.e., unoccupied by any mobile home,
camper trailer, recreational vehicle, or the like, the owner of the park, or
his duly authorized agent, may request removal by the sanitation department of
the auto cart for that pad. Once removed, no refuse collection charge shall be
made for that lot/pad until another cart is delivered and service resumed.
Information supplied shall be subject to verification by city personnel and any
falsification may result in back billing and late fee charges.
   C.   Seasonal Summer Lines: Summer lines are separate metered lines
established for summer irrigation use only. Service shall be initiated
seasonally at the request of the owner and a turn on fee shall be included on
the first regular billing statement. The seasonal summer line will be turned
off in the fall either at the owner's request, or if no request is received,
the utility billing staff may shut off service at the time meter reading is
discontinued for the season. No turnoff fee will be charged.
   D.   Water Leak Adjustments: Meter readings and charges for water service
will be considered accurate unless protest is made to the utility billing
department within thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill. Adjustment may be
allowed in the event evidence clearly shows that the apparent excessive
consumption was due to underground leaking of pipes or fixtures, that the
situation was promptly reported to the utility billing department, and that
repairs were promptly made. The utility billing director shall determine the
number of gallons of water usage which could reasonably be the result of
leakage and authorize a billing credit of one-half (1/2) the amount of the
charges attributable to leakage for one billing period only. Requests for
adjustments for longer periods of time or for additional amounts shall be
referred to the water superintendent whose decision shall be final.
   E.   Continuous Service Requests: Owners of single-family residences may
request that utility service revert to their names and accounts following
finalizing of the account by any tenant occupant of the premises. A transfer
fee shall be charged for the initializing of each account and utility service
will continue under the terms of the agreement.
   F.   Estimates: An estimated bill for water/sewer service may be issued when
weather or other circumstances do not permit reading of meters. Estimated bills
will be calculated by utilizing the consumption figure for the corresponding
period of time for the previous year and the current water rate. If estimated
rates charged are higher than actual consumption, a credit will be issued to
the account based on the first meter reading thereafter. (Ord. 2903, 2011: Ord.
2652, 2000)
13.30.090: ACCESS TO PREMISES AND METER:
   A.   Employees of the utility billing department properly identified shall
have unobstructed access from seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to nine o'clock (9:00)

citation as per state or municipal law/regulations. (Ord. 2977, 2016)
13.30.100: DUE DATES:

15.03.060: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTORS:
In order to maintain a license in good standing and to be eligible to obtain
permits for work to be performed within the city, all construction trades
contractors are required to meet the following conditions. Claims against the
license and permit bond may be made by the city for failure of any contractor
to meet these obligations; violation of any duty or responsibility listed.
   A.   Ensure that applicable insurance, bonding, permits, licenses, or
registrations are obtained prior to commencing work or allowing subcontractors
to commence work and accurately report the value of the construction on all
forms.
      1.   Builders must provide authorization for the work to be performed in
the form of a written contract when applying for a permit for work covered
under the contract; this requirement may be fulfilled by providing a copy of an
accepted bid or estimate signed by both the builder and the client which
includes the total cost of the work.
      2.   Other contractors who are eligible for phone in permits are required
to provide complete and accurate information as to scope of work and amounts
being charged and such additional information as deemed appropriate by the
city; requests for permits must be made prior to commencement of the work.
   B.   Pay on time and in full all fees assessed for permits; in the case of
phone in permits or permits for which monthly statements are issued, to pay all
amounts due within thirty (30) days of the statement date. Payment by means of
"insufficient funds" or canceled account checks shall be deemed a violation of
this requirement unless payment in full is tendered in cash, money order, or
cashier's check, along with returned check fees within three (3) working days
of notification from city staff. No permits may be issued to any contractor
whose account is in arrears through late payment, lack of payment, or denial of
payment by a financial institution, until all fees due have been paid in full
in cash, money order, or cashier's check.
Note: Contractors must be in good standing, i.e., possess current valid
licenses, bond and insurance coverage as required, and not be delinquent in
complying with conditions or deadlines on other projects or delinquent in
payments in order to be issued permits for work covered by the license.
   C.   Complete all work authorized on the permit or set out in the contract
and comply with all conditions listed on the permit, including time frames and
deadlines, in conformance with such drawings and specifications as may be
required by the building department, or obtain approval for changes.
   D.   Provide the client a written contract for the work to be performed and
ensure that all work specified in the contract is done in accordance with
applicable construction codes and the terms of any applicable permits, whether
such work is done by the contractor or by a subcontractor.
   E.   Make prompt and valid payment to all subcontractors and materialmen in
an amount proportionate to the work done, materials received, and payment
received from the client. The filing of a lien against a client's property by
subcontractors or materialmen may constitute violation of this requirement.
   F.   Obtain inspection services promptly and in the proper sequence when the
same are required by this or any other ordinance of the city and maintain
accessibility and visibility for the work until inspection and approval have
been obtained.
   G.   Obtain final inspections and certificates of occupancy or final
inspection approval.
   H.   Provide minimum safety measures and equipment to protect workmen and

15.32.010: STATUTORY AUTHORITY:
The Legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code sections 46-1020,
46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments to adopt floodplain
management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum floodplain
development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human life, health,
and property. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Pocatello, Idaho does
hereby ordain as follows. (Ord. 3054, 2020)
15.32.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Pocatello are subject to periodic
inundation that results in:
      1.   Loss of life and property;
      2.   Health and safety hazards;
      3.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
      4.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection;
and
      5.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by development in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
   C.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management. (Ord. 3054, 2020)
15.32.030: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life, health, and property;
   B.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
   C.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
   D.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   E.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   F.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   G.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 3054, 2020)
15.32.040: OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   A.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   B.   Restrict or prohibit development which is dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
   C.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
   D.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
   E.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters. (Ord. 3054, 2020)

SYSTEM:        typically includes dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood
               modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
               standards.
               The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be

HIGHEST        The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction, adjacent
ADJACENT GRADE to the proposed walls of a structure. Refer to the FEMA elevation certificate for
(HAG):         HAG related to building elevation information.
               A structure that is:
               A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing
               maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the
               Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the
               National Register;
               B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
               contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or to
               a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered
HISTORIC       historic district;

               programs.
               A general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to
               FIRMs that can be accomplished by letter. They include letter of map amendment
               (LOMA), letter of map revision (LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill
               (LOMR-F)
               A.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
               effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
               property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
               (SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
               inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
               ground above the base flood elevation.
               B.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective flood
               insurance rate map (FIRM) or a flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) or both. LOMRs
               are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the
               hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the
               modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
LETTER OF MAP  elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially
CHANGE (LOMC): revises the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or flood boundary and floodway map
               (FBFM), and sometimes the flood insurance study (FIS) report, and when appropriate,
               includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an
               annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
               C.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the
               special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) based
               on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The LOMR-F does
               not change the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
               D.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to
               whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the
               minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special
               flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map
               (FIRM) or flood insurance study (FIS). Upon submission and approval of certified as-
               built documentation, a letter of map revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise
               the effective FIRM. Building permits and/or flood development permits cannot be
               issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
               A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed
LEVEE:         according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or divert the flow of
               water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
               A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
LEVEE SYSTEM:  structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated
               in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST         The lowest point of the ground level next to the structure. Refer to the FEMA

REGULATORY     See FLOODWAY.
FLOODWAY:
               To bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local
               floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the
REMEDY A       impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting
VIOLATION:     the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the
               enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar
               violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or
               other development.
REPETITIVE     An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two (2) paid flood losses of more
LOSS           than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any ten (10) year period since 1978.
STRUCTURE:
RIVERINE:      Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream,
               brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD  The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or
HAZARD AREA    greater chance of flooding in any given year. For purposes of these regulations, the
(SFHA):        term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of
               special flood hazard."
               Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
               provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
               addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of
               the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
               construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
               installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
               excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
START OF       Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading,
CONSTRUCTION:  and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
               does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
               erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
               accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
               part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
               construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
               structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
               dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE:     A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
               principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
               Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
               structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed forty nine percent
               (49%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial
SUBSTANTIAL    improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a
DAMAGE:        structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the
               cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
               exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the
               damage occurred.
               Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
               the cost of which equals or exceeds forty nine percent (49%) of the market value of
               the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term
               includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the
               actual repair work performed. The term does not, include either:
SUBSTANTIAL    A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
IMPROVEMENT:   state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
               identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
               necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
               B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not
               preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the
               alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this chapter.
               FEMA publications that provide guidance concerning the building performance
               standards of the NFIP, which are contained in 44 CFR Part 60.3. The bulletins and
               fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and local officials responsible
               for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by members of the development
               community, such as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as
TECHNICAL      updates of existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do
BULLETINS AND  not create regulations. Rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the
TECHNICAL FACT minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.
SHEETS:        It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact sheets provide
               guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community
               requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals
               should contact the community officials to determine whether more restrictive state
               or local regulations apply to the building or site in question. All applicable
               standards of the state or local building code must also be met for any building in a
               flood hazard area.
TEMPERATURE    Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling system, built-in or
CONTROLLED:    appliance.
VARIANCE:      A grant of relief by the governing body from a requirement of this chapter.
               The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
               community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development
VIOLATION:     without the finished construction elevation certificate, other certifications, or
               other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR Parts 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10),
               (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as
               that documentation is provided.

   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: The
Floodplain Administrator shall perform, but not be limited to, the following
duties:
      1.   Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits for
all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to
assure that all necessary local, state, and federal permits have been received,
including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 USC § 1334.
      3.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA). This is the
LOMC procedure.
      4.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. This is a hydraulic and
hydrology analysis.
      5.   Prevent encroachments into floodways unless the certification and
flood hazard reduction provisions of section
15.32.150 are met.
      6.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new
and substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of
section
15.32.080C.
      7.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
to which all new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been
floodproofed, in accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.080C.
      8.   Review plans to verify public utilities are constructed in
accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.110E,
15.32.110F, and
15.32.110G.
      9.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
and maintain certifications from a registered professional engineer or
architect in accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.080C and section
15.32.120B.
      10.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, and floodways (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this section.
      11.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.060B, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data, along with
floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including data
developed pursuant to section
15.32.130B, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
      12.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.060B, require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zone AE on the
community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. This is a hydraulic
and hydrology analysis.
      13.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      14.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator
shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that
the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and
the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator
has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      15.   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order constitutes a misdemeanor.
      16.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The Floodplain
Administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may
also be revoked.
      17.   Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his or her inspections department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      18.   Follow through with corrective procedures of section
15.32.090.
      19.   Review, provide input, and make recommendations for variance
requests.
      20.   Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to,
the FIS report, FIRM and other official flood maps, and studies adopted in
accordance with the provisions of 15.32.060B of this chapter, including any
revisions thereto including letters of map change, issued by FEMA. Notify the
NFIP State Coordinator and FEMA of your community's mapping needs.
      21.   Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including letters of
map revision based on fill (LOMR-Fs) and letters of map revision (LOMRs).
      22.   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA) of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance
with this part. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
      23.   Upon occurrence, notify the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA)
in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that all FHBM's and FIRM's accurately represent the community's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the community
suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new
area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority. (Ord. 3054, 2020)

for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including
alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy,
additions, rehabilitations, renovations, improvements, repairs of damage, and
any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures, the
Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with the Building Official, shall:
      1.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
      2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
      3.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
      4.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance

counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      3.   That following the hearing, the Floodplain Administrator may issue
an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
   C.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance, he or she shall issue an order in writing to the owner, requiring
the owner to remedy the violation within a specified time period, not less than
sixty (60) calendar days, nor more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days,
unless prior arrangements are made with the Floodplain Administrator. Where the
Floodplain Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser
period as may be feasible.
   D.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal the order to the Construction Board of Appeals by giving notice of
appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the clerk within ten (10)
days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the
order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The Construction Board of
Appeals shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify
and affirm, or revoke the order.
   E.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the Construction Board of Appeals
following an appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished at the discretion of the court. (Ord. 3054, 2020)
15.32.100: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   The Construction Board of Appeals as established by City of Pocatello,
hereinafter referred to as the "appeal board", shall hear and decide requests

      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined
under section
15.32.050 of this chapter as a functionally dependent facility, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

above factors in division C with their application for a variance.
   E.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
   F.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance. Such notification shall be maintained with a record
of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
   G.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the State of Idaho upon request.

15.32.110: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all special flood hazard areas, the following provisions are required:
   A.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall
be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Foundations within the
SFHA will be designed by a licensed professional engineer.
   B.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall
be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials
Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   C.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development shall
be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
   D.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
   E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   F.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
   G.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   H.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved
structures, which is below the lowest floor used solely for parking, access,
and storage shall:
      1.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the
flood protection elevation; and
      2.   Include, in Zones A, AE, and AH, and AO flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         b.   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         c.   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area
must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;
         d.   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than

         e.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         f.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or flood resistant wood underpinning, regardless of
structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as
outlined above.
   I.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure,
which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the
requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
   J.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this
chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, or stream
setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the flood
protection elevation in the floodway, or stream setback, and provided that such
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this chapter.
   K.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in section
15.32.100I. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an
allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater
treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area only if the
structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the flood
protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions of section
15.32.080C.
   L.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and determined to be
reasonably safe from flooding.
   M.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   N.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC § 1334.
   P.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals greater than
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include
within such proposals base flood elevation data.
   Q.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area,
the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
   R.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
   S.   Foundations within the SFHA will be designed by a licensed professional
engineer. (Ord. 3054, 2020)
15.32.120: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:

of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building
or structure, the five (5) year period begins on the date of the first
improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective
date of this chapter. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
         a.   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
         b.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a

buoyancy (assuming the tank is empty);
      2.   Elevated above-ground tanks, in flood hazard areas shall be attached
to and elevated to or above the design flood elevation on a supporting
structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement
during conditions of the base flood. Tank-supporting structures shall meet the
foundation requirements of the applicable flood hazard area;
      3.   Not elevated above-ground tanks may be permitted in flood hazard
areas provided the tanks are anchored or otherwise designed and constructed to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood, including the effects
of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty and the effects of flood-borne debris.
      4.   Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and vents shall be:
         a.   At or above the flood protection elevation or fitted with covers
designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the contents of the

and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of
the base flood.
   I.   Construction Of Below-Grade Crawlspace:
      1.   The interior grade of a crawlspace must not be more than two feet
(2') below the exterior lowest adjacent grade (LAG).
      2.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, must not
exceed four feet (4') at any point.
      3.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a flood event.
      4.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet
(5') per second for any crawlspace.
      5.   See Technical Bulletin 11 for further information.
      6.   Caution: Buildings that have below-grade crawlspaces will have
higher flood insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred
crawlspace construction, with the interior elevation of the crawlspace soil at
or above the base flood elevation (BFE).
   J.   Subdivision Plats:
      1.   Flood Zones:
         a.   A note must be provided on the final plat documenting the current
flood zone in which the property or properties are located. The boundary line
must be drawn on the plat in situations where two (2) or more flood zones
intersect over the property or properties being surveyed.
         b.   The note must include the following information:
               FEMA FIRM panel(s): #160xxxxxxC, & 160xxxxxxE, etc.
               FIRM effective date(s): mm/dd/year
               Flood Zone(s): Zone X, Zone A, Zone AE, A Zone AO, Zone, AH,
Zone D, etc.
               Base Flood Elevation(s): AE ____.0 ft., etc.

is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA or the mapped
five hundred (500) year floodplain boundary shall have the lowest floor
elevated three feet (3') above BFE or to the height of the five hundred (500)
year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility
should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above
the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible. Recommended best practices for critical
facilities can be found in Executive Order 11988 and FEMA 543 Design Guide for
Improving Critical Facility Safety from Flooding and High Winds (2007).
   L.   Compensatory Storage: New development shall not reduce the effective
flood storage volume of the regulatory floodway and SFHA. A development
proposal shall provide compensatory storage if grading or other activity
eliminates any effective flood storage volume. Compensatory storage shall:
      1.   Provide equivalent volume at equivalent elevations to that being
displaced. For this purpose, "equivalent elevation" means having similar
relationship to ordinary high water and the best available one hundred (100)
year water surface profiles;
      2.   Be hydraulically connected to the source of flooding; and
      3.   Provide compensatory storage in the same construction season as when
the displacement of flood storage volume occurs and before the flood season
begins.
      The newly created storage area shall be graded and vegetated to allow
fish access during flood events without creating fish stranding sites.
   M.   Pit, Mine, Quarry, Or Gravel Extraction: Approval of a CLOMR shall be
required as a condition of approval for any proposed pit, mine, quarry, or

site will be designed to avoid river avulsion (the sudden separation of land
from one property and its attachment to another, especially by flooding or a
change in the course of a river). FEMA must approve the CLOMR prior to
commencement of the use or breaking ground. Gravel mining operations or
excavations are not permitted within one hundred feet (100') of the top of
river bank regardless of floodway or floodplain designation. Material
stockpiles and permanently installed structures shall not be located within the
regulatory floodway. (Ord. 3054, 2020)

15.42.010: FINDINGS:
The communications act of 1934 as amended by the telecommunications act of 1996
("the act") grants the federal communications commission (FCC) exclusive
jurisdiction over the regulation of the environmental effects of radio
frequency (RF) emissions from communications facilities and the regulation of
radio signal interference among users of the RF spectrum. The regulation of
towers and communications facilities will not have the effect of prohibiting
any person from providing wireless communications services in violation of the
act. (Ord. 2979, 2016: Ord. 2662, 2001)
15.42.020: PURPOSES:
   A.   The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of wireless communications facilities in order
to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same
time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless communications marketplace in the city.
   B.   Specifically, the purposes of this chapter are:
      1.   To regulate the location of wireless communications facilities in
the city;
      2.   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and other communications facilities;
      3.   To minimize adverse visual impact of wireless communications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
      4.   To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use wireless communications facilities;
      5.   To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of tower structures to
support antenna and communications facilities;
      6.   To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless
communications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully
designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or
are determined to be structurally unsound; and
      7.   To ensure that wireless communications facilities are compatible
with surrounding land uses to the greatest extent reasonably possible. (Ord.
2979, 2016: Ord. 2662, 2001)
15.42.030: DEFINITIONS:
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
   ACOUSTICAL ENGINEER: A professional engineer with demonstrated education,
accreditation and experience to perform and certify noise measurements.
   ANTENNA: An apparatus, designed for the purpose of emitting radio frequency
(RF) radiation, to be operated or operating from a fixed location pursuant to
FCC for the transmission of writing, signs, signals, data, images, pictures,
and sounds of all kinds, including the transmitting device and any on-site
equipment, switches, wiring, cabling, power sources, shelters or cabinets
associated with that antenna and added to a tower, structure, or building as
part of the original installation of the antenna. For most services, an antenna
will be mounted on or in, and is distinct from, a supporting structure such as
a tower, structure or building. However, in the case of AM broadcast stations,
the entire tower or group of towers constitutes the antenna for that station.
For purposes of this section, the term antenna does not include unintentional
radiators, mobile stations, or devices authorized under 47 CFR part 15.
   ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Any building or structure other than a tower
which can be used for location of communications facilities.
   APPLICANT: Any person who applies for a wireless communications facility
permit.
   APPLICATION: The process by which the owner of a parcel of land within the
City submits a request to develop, construct, build, modify, or erect a tower
upon such parcel of land. Application includes all written documentation,
verbal statements, and representations, in whatever form or forum, made by an
applicant to the City concerning such a request.
   BASE STATION: A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC
licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a
communications network. The term does not encompass a "tower" as defined in
this section or any equipment associated with a tower.
   A.   The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with
wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety
services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services
such as microwave backhaul.
   B.   The term includes, but is not limited to, radio receivers, antennas,
coaxial or fiber optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable
equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed
antenna systems ("DAS") and small cell networks).
   C.   The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time
the relevant application is filed with the City under this chapter, supports or
houses equipment described under subsections A and B of this definition that
has been reviewed and approved by the City.
   BUILDING: Any permanent structure built for the shelter or enclosure of
person, animals, chattels or property of any kind, which is permanently affixed
to the land and which has one or more floors and a roof.
   CARRIER: A company that provides wireless services.
   COLLOCATION: The mounting or installation of an antenna on an existing
tower, building or structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving
radio frequency signals for communications purposes, whether or not there is an
existing antenna on the structure.
   CONCEALMENT: The act of hiding something or preventing it from being known.
   CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT: Uses that are allowed within a zoning district
provided that certain standards (or "conditions") are met that will enhance the
compatibility of the proposed use with other surrounding uses. Often
conditional uses are unique and their effect on the surrounding environment
cannot be determined in advance of a specific proposal for a particular
location. Application for a conditional use permit affords the City an
opportunity to review the location, design, configuration, and potential impact
of the proposed use on surrounding land uses.
   DEPLOYMENT: The placement, construction or modification of a personal
wireless service facility.
   DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEM OR DAS: A network consisting of transceiver
equipment at a central hub site to support multiple antenna locations
throughout the desired coverage area.
   ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUEST: Any request for modification of an existing
tower or base station that, within the meaning of section 6409(a) of the
Spectrum Act (47 USC section 1455(a)), as interpreted by the FCC in its Report
and Order No. 14-153 and regulated by 47 CFR 1.40001, does not substantially
change the physical dimensions of that tower or base station, and involves: a)
collocation of new transmission equipment, b) the removal of transmission
equipment, or c) the replacement of transmission equipment.
   ELIGIBLE SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Any tower or base station that exists at the
time the application is filed with the City.
   EQUIPMENT ENCLOSURE: A small enclosed structure, shelter, cabinet, box, or
vault at the base of the support system within which are housed batteries and
electrical equipment.
   EXISTING STRUCTURE: Previously erected support structure or any other
structure, including but not limited to, base stations, buildings, transmission
towers, utility poles, light poles, traffic signal poles, or similar structures
to which wireless facilities can be attached.
   FCC: The Federal Communications Commission or successor agency.
   MONOPOLE: A single, freestanding pole-type structure supporting one or more
antennas and includes but is not limited to a utility pole and light pole.
   PHOTOSIMULATION: Computer generated photographs, renderings combining
existing subject adjacent property conditions and improvements with proposed
improvements.
   PLANNING COVERAGE MAP: A map, maps, or plan on which are marked the service
areas of other WCF sites operated by the applicant. The planning coverage map
shall be considered exempt from disclosure pursuant to Idaho Code section 9-340
(D) or as subsequently amended.
   REPLACEMENT: Constructing a new support structure of proportions and of
equal height or such other height that would not constitute a substantial
change to a pre-existing support structure in order to support a facility or to
accommodate collocation and removing the pre-existing support structure.
   RIGHTS-OF-WAY: The area in the City on, below, or above a roadway, highway,
street, sidewalk, curb, lawn strip, alley, utility easement, lighting or
drainage facility, or similar property, but not including Federal interstate
highway, that is reserved or dedicated for use as a public right-of-way or by
or for the public. The "public right-of-way" includes all public streets and
utility easements owned by or dedicated to, the City of Pocatello, or other
public entity.
   SERVICE AREA: Contained areas within which a wireless communication facility
is able to transmit clear signals, generally circular in form.
   SITE: For towers outside the right-of-way, means the current boundaries of
the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility
easements currently related to the site (for other towers and all base
stations). "Site" is restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and
to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.
   SMALL CELL FACILITIES: A facility mounted on structures fifty feet (50') or
less in height or on structures no more than ten percent (10%) taller than
adjacent structures with an antenna no more than three (3) cubic feet and a
total wireless equipment no more than twenty eight (28) cubic feet.
   SPECTRUM ACT: Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act and Job
Creation Act, 47 USC section 1455(a) (providing, in part, "... a state or local
government may not deny, and shall approve, any eligible facilities request for
a modification of any existing wireless tower or base station that does not
substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.").
   STEALTH DESIGN: Technology that minimizes the visual impact of wireless
communications facilities by camouflaging, disguising, screening, and/or
blending into the surrounding environment. Examples of stealth design include,
but are not limited to, towers disguised as trees, flagpoles, bell towers, and
architecturally screened roof mounted antennas.
   SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES: In the context of an eligible support structure, a
modification of an existing tower or base station where any of the following
criteria is met:

      1.   It involves the installation of more than the standard number of new
equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4)
cabinets; or
      2.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside of the current site
of the tower or base station; or
      3.   The proposed modification would cause the concealment/camouflage
elements of the tower or base station to be defeated; or
      4.   The proposed modification would not comply with the conditions
associated with the prior siting approval of construction or modification of
the tower or base station, unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in
height, increase in width, addition of cabinets, or new exaction that does not
exceed the corresponding thresholds in this section.
      5.   Small cells mounted on structures fifty feet (50') or less in height
or on structures no more than ten percent (10%) taller than adjacent structures
with an antenna no more than three (3) cubic feet and a total wireless

ten percent (10%) or ten feet (10'), whichever is greater;
      2.   There is added an appurtenance to the body of that structure that
would protrude from the edge of that structure by more than six feet (6'); or
      3.   It involves the installation of ground cabinets that are more than
ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure; or
      4.   It involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground if there is no preexisting ground cabinet associated with that
structure.
   C.   Type 3: For any new tower (not in the public right-of-way):
      1.   The height of the tower is increased by: a) more than ten percent
(10%), or b) by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from
the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet (20'), whichever is
greater; or
      2.   There is added an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would
protrude from the edge of the tower by: a) more than twenty feet (20'), or b)
more than the width of the tower at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is
greater; or
      3.   Towers cannot be located in public rights- of-way.
   SUPPORT STRUCTURE: A structure designed to support small wireless facilities
including, but not limited to, monopoles, vertical facilities, utility poles,
City owned traffic poles, billboards, and other freestanding self-supporting
structures.
   TOWER: Includes any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any wireless communications facility.

application, the City will notify the applicant of the denial in writing
outlining the reasons for the denial. (Ord. 3025, 2019: Ord. 2979, 2016)
15.42.070: MODIFICATIONS OR COLLOCATIONS OF ANTENNAS, DAS AND SMALL CELLS:
   A.   To the extent possible not otherwise covered by subsection 15.42.040A
of this chapter, "eligible facilities requests", collocation, new WCF antenna
arrays, DAS and small cells are permitted in all zoning districts via
administrative approval provided that the antenna array or roof mounted antenna
does not constitute a "substantial change" to an existing tower or base
station.
   B.   A type 1 application with applicable fees shall be submitted.
   C.   If any support structure must be constructed to achieve the needed
elevation or if the attachment adds more than ten feet (10') above the existing
structure or roofline, the proposal is subject to a type 2 review and
application. The limitation to constitute a "substantial change" to an existing
tower or base station applies to cumulative increases and any previously
approved additions to height made under this section must be included in said
measurement.
   D.   Any equipment shelter, cabinet or ancillary equipment are subject to
building setbacks as required in the underlying zoning district.
   E.   Applicable building, mechanical, and electrical permits are required as

multiple small cells spaced to provide wireless coverage in a contiguous area.
(Ord. 3025, 2019: Ord. 2979, 2016)
15.42.080: TOWER SHARING, COLLOCATION, PREFERRED TOWER LOCATIONS AND STANDARDS:
   A.   Tower Sharing And Collocation: New WCF facilities shall, to the maximum
extent feasible, collocate on existing towers or other structures of a similar
height to avoid construction of new towers, unless precluded by zoning
constraints such as height, structural limitations, inability to obtain
authorization by the owner of an alternate location, or where an alternate
location will not meet the service coverage objectives of the applicant.
   B.   New Towers: Applications for a new tower must address all existing
towers or structures of a similar height within one-half (1/2) mile of the
proposed site as follows:
      1.   By providing evidence that a request was made to collocate on the
existing tower or other structure, with no success; or
      2.   By showing that locating on the existing tower or other structure is
infeasible with a detailed written explanation detailing why a new tower is
required.
   C.   Tower Height: Towers are exempt from the maximum height restrictions of
the districts where located.
   D.   Tower Setback, Base Station And/Or Accessory Facilities: Setbacks are
required based on the underlying zoning as measured from property lines to the
base of the tower. Setback requirements may be modified so that a tower can be
placed so as to reduce its visual impact, e.g., adjacent to trees which may
partially hide the tower.

additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not
to exceed twenty feet (20'), whichever is greater;
      2.   For existing towers in the ROW and all base stations, it increases
the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent (10%) or ten
feet (10'), whichever is greater;
      3.   For towers outside the ROW, it protrudes from the edge of the tower
more than twenty feet (20'), or more than the width of the tower structure at
the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater;
      4.   For existing towers in the ROW and all base stations, it protrudes
from the edge of the structure more than six feet (6');
      5.   It involves installation of more than the standard number of new
equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4)
cabinets;
      6.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside of the current site
of the tower or base station;
      7.   It would defeat the existing concealment/camouflage elements of the
tower or base station; or
      8.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the locality's
prior zoning approval of construction or modification of the tower or base
station, unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height, increase in
width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation that does not exceed the
corresponding "substantial change" thresholds. (Ord. 3025, 2019: Ord. 2979,

circumstances beyond the control of the applicant as determined by the planning
and development services department, after written request by the permittee.
   B.   At such time that a licensed carrier plans to abandon or discontinue
operation of a WCF, the carrier shall notify the city by first class U.S. mail
of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operations. Such
notice shall be given no less than thirty (30) days prior to abandonment or
discontinuation of operations. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to
give such notice, the WCF shall be considered abandoned, effective the day of
discontinuance.
   C.   The carrier shall remove the WCF no later than ninety (90) days after
the date of abandonment or discontinuation, properly dispose of all waste
materials from the site in accordance with local and state solid waste disposal
regulations, and restore the location to its before use state, landscaping and

SHORT PLAT SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
SECTION:
16.16.010: Short Plat Subdivision
16.16.010: SHORT PLAT SUBDIVISION:
A proposed land division creating four (4) or fewer lots, shall be reviewed by
city staff in order to determine if the proposal will require the submission of
a complete subdivision plat application or a short plat application pursuant to
the provisions of this title. If the city staff determines that a complete
subdivision application consisting of preliminary plat and final plat
applications is not required, then city staff may authorize the submittal of a
short plat subdivision application to ensure compliance with applicable
provisions of this title and Idaho Code title 50.
The short plat subdivision process does not require the submittal of separate
"preliminary plat" and "final plat" applications. A "short plat" is submitted
in the "final plat" format pursuant to this title and Idaho Code title 50.
   A.   A short plat subdivision application that does not require any public
dedication of right of way for infrastructure or other public uses which
requires acceptance by the city council is subject to the provisions of
subsections C through M of this section.
   B.   A short plat subdivision application that requires the public
dedication of right of way for infrastructure, improvements or other public
uses which requires acceptance by the city council is subject to the provisions
of subsections C through F of this section and the applicable provisions of
subsection 16.24.110A of this title.
   C.   The proposed subdivision must comply with all other applicable design
and survey standards adopted by the city.
   D.   Upon receipt of the short plat application, city staff shall perform a
completeness review within five (5) days from official receipt of the
application and applicable fees.
      1.   In the event that city staff determines that the application is
incomplete, the applicant will be notified regarding what is needed to complete
the application.
      2.   In the event that an incomplete application is returned more than
two (2) times, additional application fees may be required.
      3.   Once it is determined that the application is complete, the
application materials will be reviewed by city staff for technical compliance
with applicable code provisions and notify the applicant of any deficiencies
prior to the application being scheduled for review by the city council at a
regularly scheduled meeting.
   E.   The review by the city council is for the purpose of rendering a final
decision.
   F.   The "final short plat subdivision" shall be prepared in compliance with
the applicable provision of
chapter 16.24 of this title and applicable provisions of Idaho Code title 50.
   G.   The "final short plat subdivision" shall be submitted to the city
surveyor for review for substantial conformity to the plat reviewed by the city
council and applicable state statutes and city ordinance provisions.
      1.   If the submitted final plat is not found to be in substantial
conformity, the city surveyor will notify the applicant and the applicant will
be given the opportunity to make necessary corrections to achieve substantial
conformity.
      2.   The applicant must resubmit a corrected plat within thirty (30) days
from the date of notification by the city surveyor.
      3.   Failure to resubmit a corrected plat in conformity with the approved
plat will result in a denial and require the applicant to submit a new
application.
   H.   The "final short plat subdivision" shall contain applicable
certification statements pursuant to section
16.24.050 of this title.
   I.   Upon a determination by the city surveyor that the "final short plat
subdivision" is in conformity with the requirements of this title, appropriate
city signatures may be affixed to the plat.
   J.   After obtaining all required signatures, the plat shall be submitted to
the county clerk for review and recording in the county "records of plats" in
accordance with applicable provisions of this title and Idaho Code title 50.
   K.   The applicant shall provide the city surveyor with a copy, on Mylar
film, of the recorded plat and an electronic (digital) AutoCAD® (DWG) format
file within thirty (30) days of recording.
   L.   Expiration of the approval to record the short plat shall be two (2)
years from the date of approval by the city council. Failure to record an
approved plat within the designated time period serves to void the prior review
and approval process and will result in requiring the submittal of a new
application.
   M.   All other applicable provisions of this title shall be met. (Ord. 3043,
2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)

and the requirements set forth under this title, the final plat application
shall be submitted to the planning and development services department within
the validity period set forth in section
16.20.070 of this title. The final plat shall be in substantial conformance to
the preliminary plat as reviewed and recommended by the planning and zoning
commission.
   A.   Unless changes made directly reflect specific planning and zoning
commission recommendations, a final plat fails substantial conformity if any of
the following occur:
      1.   The number of lots has increased more than five percent (5%) within
any proposed division or a significant change in the configuration of lots.
      2.   Street alignment has changed significantly.
      3.   Additional streets are proposed.
      4.   A significant change, more than ten percent (10%), in the size or
location of required open space whether public or private.
      5.   All development shall comply with the plat phasing in sequence shown
and approved on the preliminary plat. Any variation of the sequence shall be
reapproved following a full staff review and subsequent approval by the
Director.
      6.   Other proposed changes which may have affected the preliminary plat
reviewed by the planning and zoning commission.
   B.   City staff shall perform a completeness review of the final plat
application for substantial conformity within five (5) business days from
official receipt of the application.
      1.   If the final plat application is not complete and in substantial
conformance, the final plat application will be considered incomplete and
returned to the applicant. In the event that an incomplete application is
returned more than two (2) times, additional application fees shall be
required.
      2.   If the applicant desires to make changes affecting the substantial
conformity of the final plat, then the plat application will be resubmitted to
the planning and zoning commission for review and a new recommendation pursuant
to the preliminary plat provisions of this title. The resubmittal of a
preliminary plat for review by the planning and zoning commission will require
the applicant to submit a new application fee according to the application fee
schedule. (Ord. 3074, 2021: Ord. 3043, 2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)
16.24.070: FINAL PLAT APPROVAL:
Final approval of a subdivision plat is validated by the signatures of the
appropriate city and county officials pursuant to Idaho Code title 50 and all
applicable provisions of this code. All final plats submitted to the city must
comply with the "essentials of plats" pursuant to Idaho Code section 50-1304
and applicable city engineering and survey standards.
   A.   After city staff approves substantial conformity and completeness for
the final plat application, a meeting will be scheduled for city council
consideration for approval.
   B.   Subject to city council consideration and approval and prior to
recording, the final plat is subject to the following review process:
      1.   A full sized copy, drawn to scale, will be submitted to the city
surveyor for review and comment.
      2.   The city surveyor will review the final plat for compliance with
applicable survey provisions of Idaho Code and this title.
      3.   The city surveyor will return the submitted copy with review
comments to the subdivider's surveyor within thirty (30) days of submittal.
         a.   If corrections are required, a corrected copy and the original
copy with comments will be resubmitted to the city surveyor for review.
         b.   Subsequent reviews, if required by the city surveyor, shall be
subject to additional review fees.
      4.   Upon receiving authorization from the city surveyor, the subdivider
may submit the final plat to the surveyor for the county for review.
      5.   Upon receiving authorization from the surveyor for the county, the
subdivider may submit the final plat on Mylar film to the city surveyor in
order to obtain the authorized city signatures.
      6.   After all required city signatures are affixed to the final plat,
the subdivider will be notified that the final plat may be picked up and
presented to the county for recording.
   C.   The approval of the final subdivision plat by the city, as signified by
the signatures of the appropriate city officials, does not constitute the
city's acceptance of, or the responsibility for, any public facilities,
improvements or infrastructure associated with the development and construction
of the subdivision.
   D.   Expiration of the approval to record the final plat shall be two (2)
years from the date of approval by the city council. Failure to record an
approved plat within the designated time period serves to void the prior review
and approval process and will result in requiring the submittal of a new
subdivision application. (Ord. 3043, 2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)
16.24.080: RECORDING OF FINAL PLAT:
City approval of the final plat does not guarantee county approval for
recording. After county signatures are obtained and the final plat is recorded,
the subdivider is responsible for submitting one full size copy of the recorded
plat on Mylar film and an electronic (digital) AutoCAD® (DWG) format file to
the city surveyor within thirty (30) days of recording.
   A.   Final Plat Recording Options: Authorization by the city for the
subdivider to submit a final plat for recording to the county is signified by
obtaining all required approval signatures from the city pursuant to one of the
following processes:

16.24.110 of this chapter prior to obtaining all required approval signatures
from the city.
      2.   Authorization to record a final plat after the construction and
development and acceptance, by the city, of required public infrastructure and
improvements requires the developer to submit a duly executed warranty bond
pursuant to subsection 16.24.110E of this chapter prior to obtaining all
required approval signatures from the city.
      3.   Authorization to record a final plat prior to actual completion and
approval of all infrastructure and improvements may be approved by the public
works director pursuant to the applicable provisions of the engineering, design
and development regulations approved by the city and pursuant to compliance
with the provisions of sections
16.24.070 through
16.24.110 of this chapter. (Ord. 3043, 2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)
16.24.090: RECORDING OF PHASES:
An approved final plat may be recorded in phases subject to the following:
   A.   At the time of recording only the current phase proposed for
development is to be shown on the final plat map.
   B.   Additional phases that have been reviewed and approved by the city
council as part of the original final subdivision plat application may be
offered for recording subject to compliance with sections
16.24.010 through
16.24.110 of this chapter.
   C.   The final plat map of the additional phases offered for recording must
conform to the original final plat subdivision plat application as approved by
the city council.
   D.   All phases proposed with the final plat application must be recorded

plat application will require review and approval by the city council prior to
recording. (Ord. 3043, 2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)

signed by the city and recorded with the county and all required public
infrastructure and improvements have been extended to the furthest lot line of
the lot requesting the building permit and have been properly constructed,
inspected and officially accepted by the city.
         a.   If the developer desires to record a final subdivision plat prior
to completion of all required public infrastructure and improvements, then the

   C.   All development, improvements or other activities associated with the
development and construction of an approved subdivision plat shall be solely
the responsibility of the developer and shall be subject to applicable
engineering, design and development regulations adopted by the city of
Pocatello. (Ord. 3043, 2020: Ord. 2971, 2016)
16.24.110: SUBDIVISION SURETY BOND AND WARRANTY BOND:
   A.   Provisions: Prior to obtaining required signatures of city officials
necessary for authorization for the subdivider to record a final subdivision
plat, the subdivider shall provide the city with a subdivision surety bond

uses otherwise permitted if those uses will comply with all other provisions of
this code.
         a.   The nonconforming property shall not be diminished in size.
         b.   Any property reduced by government action that reduces an
existing conforming parcel below the required property size shall be deemed as
a conforming property for the purpose of development. To be deemed a conforming
property, the owner or applicant shall submit documents to the Planning
Director proving the following:
            (1)   The property was in compliance with the minimum property size
requirement of the applicable district prior to the decrease in property size;
and
            (2)   The decrease in property size was caused by acquisition
through prescription, purchase, or other means by the transportation authority,
a utility company, or corporation under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Public
Utilities Commission or other local, state, or federal agency.
      2.   Legal Nonconforming Buildings/Structures/Signage: A building,
structure, or sign that was legally established but no longer conforms to all
development standards of this title is considered a legal nonconforming
structure. The following standards shall apply to legal nonconforming
structures:
         a.   Interior Remodeling: Interior remodeling which does not change
the existing use or the extent of the nonconforming use shall be permitted.
         b.   Expansion: Permits to expand existing, nonconforming structures
of the original building area may be sought through the Conditional Use Permit
(CUP) process regardless of the underlying zoning district.
            (1)   Repairs: Ordinary work may be done including repair of a
legal, nonconforming building/structure so long as such repair work does not
change or increase the intensity of nonconformity.
            (2)   A legal nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed
by fire, flood, wind, earthquake, or other natural calamity or public enemy,
may be restored and the previous occupancy resumed provided that:
               (A)    Restoration or reconstruction is initiated within a
period of one (1) year from the date of destruction and the restoration is
completed, in its entirety, within three (3) years pursued to completion. If
construction surpasses three (3) years, a CUP shall be acquired;
               (B)    For signs; restoration or reconstruction is completed
within a period of one (1) year from the date of destruction. If construction
surpasses one (1) year, a CUP shall be acquired;
               (C)    The restoration does not increase the extent of the
nonconformity beyond that which existed at the time the structure became
nonconforming; and
               (D)    The structure was occupied, or for signs, in use, at the
time of such damage or destruction.
      3.   Legal Nonconforming Uses: A use that was legally established but no
longer complies with the allowed uses or restrictions of this title is
considered a legal nonconforming use.

the legal nonconforming use, which does not change or intensify the
nonconforming use, shall be permitted.
         b.   Expansion or Change: Permits to expand or change existing
nonconforming uses, land area, or density may be sought through the conditional
use permit process regardless of the underlying zoning district. Further, any
site modifications that could change or intensify a nonconforming use such as,
but not limited to, parking spaces, traffic circulation, ingress/egress, curb
cut location, landscaping removal, or similar items of change will require a
conditional use permit.
            (1)   A structure housing a legal nonconforming use that is damaged
or destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake, or other natural calamity or
public enemy, may be restored and the previous occupancy resumed provided that:
               (A)   The structure was occupied at the time of such damage or
destruction;
               (B)   Restoration or reconstruction is initiated within a period
of one (1) year from the date of destruction and the restoration is completed,
in its entirety, within three (3) years pursued to completion. If construction
surpasses three (3) years, a CUP shall be acquired;
               (C)   The restoration does not increase the floor space devoted
to the nonconforming use beyond that which existed at the time the use became
nonconforming.
            (2)   Repairs: Notwithstanding standards of this section, repairs
may be made to any structure occupied by a nonconforming use provided that such
repairs shall not have the effect of increasing the floor space devoted to the
non-conforming use, capacity or volume of business.
          c.   Termination Of Nonconforming Uses: Legal nonconforming use
status will be lost as prescribed by Idaho Code section 67-6538, or as amended.
      4.   Completion Of A Nonconforming Development: A development lawfully
under construction, for which a permit has been issued, or for which a land use
application has been accepted on the date this chapter is adopted may be
completed even if not in compliance with this chapter. The development would be
considered legal nonconforming and may be used for the purpose for which it was
designed, approved, intended, and arranged.
   B.   Required Improvements: All building permits and developments shall be
brought into full compliance with current landscaping and parking standards
except where additional parking spaces would be required and as determined by
the Planning Director or their designee.
   C.   Enforcement: The mayor, or his designee, shall be the enforcement
officer of this title.
      1.   Violation; Penalty: Any person who fails to comply with or violates

§ 1, 2008)
17.02.130: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS (CUP):
   A.   Definition: Conditional uses are uses that are allowed within a zoning
district provided that certain standards (or "conditions") are met that will
enhance the compatibility of the proposed use with other surrounding uses.
Often conditional uses are unique and their effect on the surrounding
environment cannot be determined in advance of a specific proposal for a
particular location. Application for a conditional use permit affords the city
an opportunity to review the location, design, configuration, and potential
impact of the proposed use on surrounding land uses.
   B.   Application: A CUP application shall be filed and include all
information and fees outlined on the application form.
   C.   Hearings And Notices: Upon receipt of a complete conditional use permit
application, a hearing date shall be set, notice of the hearing provided, and
hearing held in the manner required by section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
   D.   Criteria For Review: The hearing body shall review the facts and
circumstances of each proposal in terms of the following standards and
determine whether there is adequate evidence showing that the requested use at
the proposed location:
      1.   Is conditionally permitted within the subject land use district and
complies with all of the applicable provisions of this code unless modified
through the CUP process;
      2.   Is consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan
of the city;
      3.   Is compatible with existing and permitted land uses within the
general area;
      4.   Could be adequately served by public facilities and services such as
thoroughfares, transportation facilities, police and fire protection, drainage,
refuse disposal, water/sewer and schools, to ensure that the proposed use would
not be detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare;
      5.   Would be harmonious in scale, mass, coverage, density, and intensity
with all adjacent permitted land uses;
      6.   Would not adversely affect the environment to a greater degree than
had a use permitted outright by the ordinance been established;
      7.   Would not be detrimental to the public interests, health, safety, or
welfare of the city in its proposed location, size, design, and operating
characteristics.
   E.   Authority To Grant: The hearing body may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny an application for a conditional use permit. The decision
may be appealed by the applicant or other affected persons (according to the
provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6521) to the city council, using the
process outlined in section
17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter. The hearing body may impose any
conditions necessary to accomplish the following:
      1.   Minimize potential adverse impacts on other developments and
surrounding land use;
      2.   Control the sequence and timing of development;
      3.   Control the duration of the construction period;
      4.   Assure that development is maintained properly;
      5.   Designating the exact location and nature of development;
      6.   Require the provision for on site or off site public facilities or
services;
      7.   Require more restrictive standards than those generally required in
this title;
      8.   Require mitigation of effects of the proposed development upon
service delivery by any political subdivision, including school districts,
providing services within the planning jurisdiction;
      9.   Require that studies addressing demographic, economic, fiscal,
traffic, engineering, geologic, and environmental effects and any aviation
hazard as defined in Idaho Code section 21-501(2), be conducted prior to
granting approval.
   F.   Conditional Use Permit Amendments:
      1.   Staff Level Approvals: Upon written request from an applicant
detailing the proposed amendment to a conditional use permit, minor
modifications of an approved conditional use permit may be permitted after
review by the director for the following:
         a.   A reduction in density;
         b.   A relocation of dwelling units or building pads for reasons such
as road alignment or topography restrictions;
         c.   A change in phasing not to exceed one year;
         d.   A modification in the recreation area or open space design,
excepting elimination or reduction in size of ten percent (10%) or greater;
         e.   A decrease in setbacks not to exceed ten percent (10%).
      2.   Director Determination: Prior to any conditional use permit
amendment, the director shall determine if the following standards are met:
         a.   The requested amendment was not the subject of an appeal during
the public hearing process;
         b.   The requested amendment will not adversely impact adjacent
properties pursuant to review criteria listed in subsection D of this section;
         c.   A written decision will be provided to the applicant by the
director stating findings of fact and conclusions on which approval or denial
was based. If denied, applicant may appeal through the regular CUP process.
      3.   Hearing Body Approval: Upon written request from an applicant
detailing the proposed amendment to a conditional use permit, modifications of
an approved conditional use permit shall be reviewed through the regular
conditional use permit process for the following:
         a.   An increase in density;
         b.   A change that may adversely impact a neighborhood pursuant to the
review criteria listed in subsection D of this section. Such impacts may
include, but are not limited to, traffic generation or flow, grading, increase
in building size;
         c.   Any other changes or deletion of a condition of approval not
addressed in subsection F1, "Staff Level Approvals", of this section.
   G.   Conditional Use Permit Expiration: Uses for which a conditional use
permit has been granted shall be established within two (2) years from the date
of approval, including meeting all conditions, unless otherwise provided for in
the CUP approval. Should the conditional use and conditions not be established
within this period of time or as provided in the CUP approval, the conditional
use permit shall become null and void, unless the applicant has been granted a
time extension. In addition, a conditional use permit that has expired
according to the provisions of this section shall not be reestablished without
a new conditional use permit being approved.
   H.   Time Extension: An applicant that has been granted a CUP may request a
time extension that is not to exceed an additional one (1) year period. The
director may grant the request if filed prior to the expiration of the permit
and provided the applicant demonstrates good cause for the delay. Time
extensions that are denied by the director may be appealed through the usual
appeal process.
   I.   Conditional Use Permit To Run With The Land: Unless specifically
amended in the approving document, a conditional use permit granted pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter shall continue for the approved use upon a
change of property ownership.
   J.   Application Resubmittal: No application for a conditional use permit
that has been denied by the hearing body or city council shall be resubmitted
in either the same or substantially the same form less than one year from the
date of final action, unless specifically authorized by the granting body.
   K.   Parallel Use Consideration: When a structure, which clearly was
constructed for other than residential purposes, is granted a conditional use
permit for a specific use or houses a legal, nonconforming use, it shall be
permissible for a parallel use (one from the same use classification as the
original conditional use) to be established within the conditions of the
original conditional use permit or legal, nonconforming use, following an
evaluation by the Director, subject to the following criteria:
      1.   General intensity of use is not anticipated to be greater than the
approved use;
      2.   Parking space requirements are the same or less than the approved or
existing use;
      3.   No expansion in either building or land area is requested;
      4.   No significant exterior additions or changes are proposed, such as,
but not limited to, lighting, removal of landscaping, or signage. (Ord. 3132,
2023: Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.02.140: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is to
facilitate a more flexible mixture of uses and developments. They are intended
to allow for greater localized density, to encourage clustered development for
preservation of open spaces, to arranging living patterns in accordance with
good planning principles, and to provide adequate safeguards to protect the
community.
   B.   Uses Permitted: The underlying zoning district indicated within a PUD
will determine the principal uses permitted.
   C.   Criteria For Review: The facts and circumstances of each proposal shall
be reviewed and written findings of fact that address the following criteria
shall be prepared:
      1.   The project provides alternative methods of land development;
      2.   The project includes a mix of land uses; these uses are compatible
and well integrated even though they might otherwise be discouraged through
conventional zoning techniques;
      3.   The project conserves natural and topographic features;
      4.   The project promotes compatibility with adjacent land uses,
established neighborhoods, and available public facilities;
      5.   The project considers intensity of use including, but not limited
to, building coverage, magnitude of activities, density, and traffic
circulation/patterns;
      6.   The project emphasizes architectural design and aesthetic value; and
      7.   The project emphasizes provision of open spaces and quality
recreation areas and facilities.
   D.   General Standards: The following standards shall apply to all proposed
PUDs:
      1.   Ownership Or Unitary Control: A PUD shall be under single ownership
or unified control throughout the entire planning stage and the completion of
all approved infrastructure to ensure that development is accomplished as
planned. Proof of single ownership or unified control is required and may be
demonstrated by a deed showing a single owner, restrictive covenants of a
property owners' association, or otherwise as approved by the city.
      2.   Integration: In the design process, particular effort shall be made
to integrate a PUD proposal with the surrounding natural and built out
environment. Particular attention shall be paid to proposed traffic patterns,
pedestrian circulation, surrounding land uses, and drainage patterns.
      3.   Subdivision Requirements: Any PUD that includes a subdivision of
land shall comply with all standards set forth by the subdivision ordinance of
the city. Subdividing of land may not proceed until a proposed PUD has been
approved.
      4.   Open Space: Regardless of the type of PUD, common open space shall
encompass at least twenty percent (20%) of the net land area involved in the
development. Rights of way and areas included within private lots shall not be
counted toward the required open space. The required common open space shall
include, but not be limited to, usable recreation areas and/or facilities
(e.g., parks, clubhouses, athletic courts, pools, trails).
Land dedicated as open space shall be permanently maintained by either private
covenants attached to and made part of the plan, or if suitable and mutually
agreeable to the applicant and the city, by public dedication. If open space is
to be maintained through private covenants, the director may require, prior to
recording of any final plat, establishment of a homeowners' association and/or
either:
         a.   Completed improvements, development, and dedication of open space
features;
         b.   Posting of a bond sufficient to assure completion of
improvements, development, and dedication of open space features.
      5.   Grading And Vegetation: All lands graded and/or stripped of
vegetation, except private residential yards, shall be revegetated by the
developer in a timely manner with approved species adapted to site conditions.
Revegetation plans shall be submitted to and approved by the city engineer or
designee prior to grading.
      6.   Time Frame: For any approved PUD, physical construction of approved
infrastructure shall begin within three (3) years of final approval of the PUD.
Grading or landscaping does not constitute physical construction. Build-out of
the PUD infrastructure shall be completed within five (5) years of final
approval. If not complete, the PUD becomes null and void and reapplication is
required thereafter. If requested, the planning and zoning commission may
consider granting time extensions for the PUD time frames described herein.
Extensions shall not exceed a one year period, and requests for such extensions
shall be received by the city at least three (3) months prior to the expiration
date. These time limits may be as otherwise adjusted and approved through the
PUD process.
      7.   Planned Unit Development To Run With The Land: A planned unit
development granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall continue
for the approved use upon a change of property ownership, subject to the same
conditions and terms of approval.
   E.   Procedures:
      1.   The applicant shall meet with planning staff to discuss submission
of a development plan and application. The purpose of this meeting is for
preliminary and informal review of the purpose and effect of the PUD,
introduction of the review criteria and standards for PUDs, to familiarize the
applicant with the comprehensive plan, land use and development standards, and
to explain the process.
      2.   A PUD application shall be filed and include all information listed
on the application form. In addition to the requirements outlined in the
application, the applicant shall also address in written form any exceptions
requested to the development standards of
chapter 17.05 of this title.
      3.   Upon receipt of a complete application and development plan, a
hearing date shall be set, notice of the hearing provided, and hearing held in
the manner required by section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
      4.   The planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval,
approval with conditions, or denial of PUD application requests. The
commission's recommendation shall be forwarded to the city council for final
decision.
   F.   Amendments (Major And Minor): An approved PUD may be amended by the
following procedures:
      1.   Major Amendments: These shall be processed in the same manner as the
original planned unit development application. Major amendments are listed
below:
         a.   Change in the proposed land uses;
         b.   Change in the street pattern, particularly if it would negatively
impact adjoining property as determined by the director;
         c.   Increase in overall density or intensity of use that exceeds
either:
            (1)   Ten percent (10%) of the approved number of dwelling units;
or
            (2)   Ten percent (10%) of the total approved building square
footage;
         d.   Decrease of more than ten percent (10%) of approved number of
parking spaces;

17.02.150: NEIGHBORHOOD REFINEMENT PLAN (NRP):
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of the neighborhood refinement plan to
encourage the development of livable new neighborhoods that include a mix of
uses, a high level of street connectivity, and are pedestrian oriented.
   B.   Applicability: A neighborhood refinement plan application may be filed
for those areas designated as new neighborhoods on the development overlay map
of the comprehensive plan and the zoning map (NRP) or any parcel of at least
twenty five (25) acres.
   C.   Procedures:
      1.   A neighborhood refinement plan application shall be filed by

decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application within
forty five (45) days of closure of the public hearing.
   D.   Criteria For Review: The planning and zoning commission and city
council shall review the facts and circumstances of each proposal in terms of
the following standards:
      1.   Unified property ownership of the subject area is not required;
however, letters of authorization from each property owner must be provided.
      2.   The minimum development size shall be twenty five (25) acres.
      3.   A maximum of thirty percent (30%) greater density than that
permitted by the underlying zoning district for residential uses may be
allowed, in proportion to the amount of land dedicated for public uses and/or
open space, up to a maximum of twenty percent (20%) dedication. This density
increase shall be in the ratio of three to two (3:2), rounded to the nearest
whole number. The land set aside shall be for public uses or open space and
shall benefit the public health, safety, and general welfare including, but not
limited to, the following purposes: natural drainageways; recreational trails;
public parks; access to publicly owned land or parks; schools, or post offices;
preservation of ridge tops and other scenic features; and preservation of
natural vegetation.
      4.   Lot size averaging may be used provided that the overall density

shall comply with all standards set forth by the subdivision ordinance of the
city. Subdivision of land may not proceed until a proposed neighborhood
refinement plan has been approved.
      8.   Adopted neighborhood refinement plans shall be recorded with the
Bannock County recorder.
   E.   Amendments (Major And Minor): Amendments to an approved neighborhood
refinement plan may be requested by owners of over fifty percent (50%) of the
land area within the approved neighborhood refinement plan area. An approved
neighborhood refinement plan may be amended by the following procedures:
      1.   Major Amendments: These shall conform to the standards of the
original neighborhood refinement plan application process. Major amendments are
as follows:
         a.   Change in the proposed land uses;
         b.   Change in the street pattern, including connectivity;
         c.   Increases in overall density or intensity of proposed uses;
         d.   Decreases in open space;
         e.   Any other proposed change deemed by the director to be a major
change.
      2.   Minor Amendments: These shall be reviewed and approved by the site
plan review committee. Appeal of the committee's decision may be made to the
planning and zoning commission and shall follow the procedures of section
 17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter. The
following are considered minor amendments to a neighborhood refinement plan:

17.02.160: VARIANCES:
   A.   Definition: A variance is a modification of the bulk and placement
requirements of this title as to lot size, lot width, lot depth; front yard,
side yard, rear yard setbacks; parking space requirements, height of buildings,
or other ordinance provisions adversely affecting the development or use of
property. A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege, but
may be granted to an applicant only upon a showing of undue hardship because of
the characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict with
the public interest.
   B.   Application: A variance application shall be filed with planning and
development services and include all required information and payment of fees
listed on the application form.
   C.   Hearings And Notices: Upon receipt of a complete variance application,
a hearing date shall be scheduled, notice of the hearing will be provided, and
a hearing will be held in the manner required by section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
   D.   Applicability: A variance shall concern only the modification of a
basic use permitted outright or other development regulation pertaining to the
applicable zoning district of the subject property under the current provisions
of this title.
   E.   Authority To Grant: The hearing examiner may approve, approve with
conditions, or modification, or deny an application for a variance. The
decision may be appealed by the applicant or other affected persons according
to the provisions of Idaho Code section 67-6521. Said appeal is to the city
council pursuant to the process outlined in section
17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter.
   F.   Criteria For Review: The facts and circumstances of each proposal shall
be reviewed, and a decision rendered, in the form of written findings of fact
that address all of the following criteria:
      1.   The applicant shall have taken all reasonable steps to comply with
the strict terms of the ordinance from which he or she requests the variance.
      2.   The variance sought must be the result of unusual physical
characteristics of the site in question.
      3.   The circumstances surrounding the variance request shall be due to
an undue hardship as related to the characteristics of the land, and the
applicant shall show that, absent a variance, he/she would be deprived of
rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the identical zoning district
under the terms of this title.
      4.   The undue hardship cited as the basis of a variance request did not
result from the actions of the applicant, or the current, or a prior landowner,
or any of their agents.
      5.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed variance does not
adversely affect adjacent/nearby property.
   G.   Precedents: The granting of a prior variance or referencing property
developed under prior regulations is not admissible evidence for the granting
of a new variance. Each request for a variance shall be judged on its own facts
and circumstances.
   H.   Burden Of Proof: The burden of proof that the proposed variance
complies with all of the variance criteria as described under subsection F of
this section is the responsibility of the applicant. The applicant must support
their case with substantial and competent evidence.
   I.   Variance Expiration: Authorization for an approved variance shall be
valid for a period of two (2) years from the date of approval. The approval
shall become null and void in the event implementation of the variance and all
conditions is not established within a two (2) year period. A variance permit
that has expired prior to implementation shall not be reestablished without a
new variance being approved. The time period for an approved permit may be
extended subject to subsection J of this section.
   J.   Time Extension: An applicant who has been granted a variance may
request a time extension that is not to exceed an additional one (1) year
period. A request for a time extension must be submitted in writing prior to
the expiration of the approved variance permit. The director may grant the
request provided the applicant demonstrates good cause for the extension of the
approved permit. Only one extension may be granted. A time extension request
that is denied by the director may be appealed pursuant to section
17.02.400 of this chapter. (Ord. 3132, 2023: Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2931, 2014)
17.02.170: TITLE TEXT AND MAP AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a process for
amending the text of the zoning ordinance and/or the zoning district map.
   B.   Initiation Of An Amendment:
      1.   Private Property Owner Initiation: An owner of private property
within the municipal boundary of the city of Pocatello or their duly authorized
representative, may initiate a request to amend the text of this title or to
amend the zoning district map by submitting an application to planning and
development services.
      2.   City Initiation: The city council, planning and zoning commission or
the planning and development services director may initiate action to amend the
text of this title or to amend the zoning district map.
      3.   Annexation Of Land: The city shall apply the designation of a
comprehensive plan district and a zoning district for land annexed into the
city concurrent with the annexation process.
   C.   Application: An application for zoning map and/or ordinance text change
must be filed with planning and development services and include all
information and fees outlined in the application.
   D.   Hearings And Notices: Hearings and notices for ordinance text
amendments and zoning map amendments shall be subject to section
17.02.300 of this chapter.
   E.   Criteria For Review: The planning and zoning commission and city
council shall review the facts and circumstances of each proposal in terms of
the following standards:
      1.   How the requested zoning at the location in question would be in the
community's best interest;
      2.   How the list of uses permitted by the zoning ordinance would blend
with surrounding land uses;
      3.   If the subject site is physically suitable for the type and
intensity of land uses permitted under the proposed zoning district;
      4.   If the uses permitted in the proposed zoning district would be
adequately served by public facilities and services such as thoroughfares,
police and fire protection, drainage, refuse disposal, water, sewer, and
schools, to ensure the public health, safety and general welfare;
      5.   If the uses permitted in the proposed zoning district would be
compatible in terms of their scale, mass, coverage, density, and intensity with
adjacent land uses;
      6.   Whether the proposed zoning designation is consistent with the
comprehensive plan land use map designation.
   F.   Criteria For Zoning Ordinance Text Amendment: The planning and zoning
commission and the city council shall review the facts and circumstances of a
proposed amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance based on all of the
following standards:
      1.   The proposed text amendment would be in the community's best
interest.
      2.   The proposed text amendment is consistent with the existing
provisions of the zoning ordinance.
      3.   The proposed text amendment is consistent with existing provisions
of the comprehensive plan.
   G.   Planning And Zoning Commission Action: After notice, the planning and
zoning commission shall hold a hearing to consider the request and render a
recommendation. The commission shall submit findings of fact and
recommendations to the city council within forty five (45) days following
closure of the public hearing.
   H.   City Council Action: The city council shall hold a public hearing (as
prescribed under section
17.02.300 of this chapter) within forty five (45) days of receipt of the
planning and zoning commission's recommendation. Following official closure of
the public hearing the council shall issue their findings within forty five
(45) days of the hearing's closure.
   I.   Limitation On Resubmission: If the city council adopts a zoning
classification pursuant to a request by a property owner that is consistent
with the adopted comprehensive plan, the council shall not subsequently reverse
its action or otherwise change the zoning classification of said property
without the consent in writing of the current property owner for a period of
four (4) years from the date of adoption of said individual property owner's
request for a zoning district classification change, per Idaho Code 67-6511(d).
Rezoning requests which have been rejected may not be refiled for twelve (12)
months following city council action unless the council specifically waives the
reapplication waiting period.
   J.   Contract-Zoning Agreements:
      1.   Appropriate Circumstances: As an alternative to denying a requested
zoning or rezoning, when the city council deems such zoning or change of zoning
to be inappropriate for an area due to the nature and variety of uses allowed
in the requested zoning district and their impacts on the real property in
question and the surrounding properties, the city council may elect to allow a
specific project with a specific use and/or development scheme by terms of a
contract-zoning agreement. Approval of any such agreement entered into pursuant
to this chapter shall be deemed to conditionally zone or rezone the land solely
for the uses set out in the agreement, provided all terms and provisions of the
zoning contract are fully met.
      2.   Contract Option For Zoning Or Rezoning Requests: A contract- zoning
agreement may be permitted or required at the discretion of the city council
for the zoning or rezoning of any parcel(s) of property upon application of the
owner or developer of the property, upon recommendation of the director, upon
recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, or upon the council's own
motion. Recommendation or decision to proceed by means of contract-zoning
agreement may occur at any stage in the zoning or rezoning process.
      3.   Standards For Use Of Zoning Contracts: The execution of a contract-
zoning agreement may be required in order for any project or zoning designation
to proceed if, in the opinion of the city council, the project and/or zone
contemplated is an appropriate use for the real property in general, but the
zoning designation requested or required would allow undesirable or
inappropriate land uses or development schemes for the real property in
question or for the surrounding area, whether due to the nature of the use
itself or due to its impacts on the surrounding area.
      4.   Procedures For Establishing Contract-Zoning Agreement Conditions: If
the director determines that a contract-zoning agreement is appropriate for any
zoning/rezoning request, he or she may recommend execution of such an agreement
and forward such recommendation, along with proposed conditions, to the
planning and zoning commission for consideration at its public hearing on the
zoning/rezoning request. The applicant and/or the planning and zoning
commission may also recommend this contract-zoning agreement procedure and
propose conditions. The planning and zoning commission shall, after public
hearing on the zoning/rezoning request, present its recommendation to the city
council for: a) approval of a contract-zoning agreement with suggested
conditions, or b) for outright approval of the zoning/rezoning request without
execution of any agreement, or c) for denial of the request. At any stage of
the proceedings, an applicant may propose conditions for the agreement and
shall be given opportunity to comment on proposed conditions.
      5.   Form And Content Of Agreement: In the event a contract-zoning
agreement is deemed appropriate by the city council, the developer or owner
shall execute an agreement with the city that shall be reviewed and approved
for form by the city attorney prior to final council action. The agreement
shall contain the provisions set out below, and once executed by the developer/
owner, shall be presented to council for its approval. Minimum provisions shall
include:
         a.   Identification of use(s) to be allowed under the agreement.
         b.   Identification of development standards that shall be required
under the agreement.
         c.   Planned implementation of improvements and planned construction/
completion schedule.
         d.   Required surety for project completion if abandoned or otherwise
uncompleted.
         e.   A provision that the owner/developer acknowledges and agrees that
failure to comply with the terms of the agreement shall result in a rezoning of
the real property to the zoning district existing immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement.
         f.   A provision specifying that the agreement and all conditions,
terms, duties, and obligations included in said agreement shall be an
encumbrance on the real property and shall run with the land.
         g.   Any other matter required by the city council.
      6.   City Council Approval: Contract-zoning agreements may be approved at
the sole discretion of the city council following a public hearing before the
council on the related zoning/rezoning application. Following the hearing, the
council shall set out the conditions it deems appropriate for inclusion in the
contract- zoning agreement, which shall be prepared by the city attorney's
office for execution by the developer/owner, and submitted to the council for
final approval and execution within thirty (30) days of the public hearing.
Provided, however, that no such agreement shall become effective until adoption
and publication of the zone change ordinance. Following approval and execution
by all parties of the contract-zoning agreement, the city clerk shall cause
said agreement to be recorded in the office of the Bannock County clerk and
recorder.
      7.   Duty To Comply: The owner(s), co-owner(s), developer(s), agent(s) of
owner or developer, assignee(s) of owner(s) or developer(s) and all subsequent
owners or developers of the real property that is encumbered by the contract-
zoning agreement shall comply with all conditions, terms, obligations, and
duties contained in said agreement. Failure to comply shall result in
withholding of certificates of occupancy, execution of "stop work" orders,
discontinuance of water service, and/or subject the real property to the
provisions set out in the enforcement section that follows.
      8.   Modification Of Contract-Zoning Agreement: Modifications to
contract-zoning agreements may be made at the sole discretion of the city
council upon application of the owner/developer to the planning and development
services department, after public hearing on the matter with notification to
the owner/developer and general public as provided by state law and the
provisions of section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings", of this chapter.
Provided, however, that no application for modification may be accepted if the
request is to allow a use that is not an outright or conditionally permitted
use under the terms of the zoning ordinance for the zone established by the
contract-zoning agreement.
      9.   Consideration Of Termination Of Contract And Reversion Of Zone:
         a.   Public Hearing: Upon notification to the city council by the
director of noncompliance of a contract-zoning agreement, the council shall
establish a date for a public hearing on said noncompliance. Written notice of
said hearing shall be published in the local newspaper fifteen (15) days prior
to the hearing and mailed to the owner/developer at his last known address.
After the public hearing the city council shall adopt a written decision with
appropriate findings, specifying whether the owner/developer is in compliance
and continuing the agreement or whether the owner/developer is in noncompliance
and terminating the agreement.
         b.   Effect Of Termination: In the event the agreement is terminated,
the city council shall adopt an ordinance reverting the subject real property
to its previous land use zoning district. All uses that are not consistent with
the zoning district established by said ordinance shall cease and shall not be
considered as legal nonconforming uses. The water service to the premises of
said uses may be discontinued unless the owner/developer is applying for a
conditional use permit for uses which are allowable by such permit under the
zone established by said ordinance. If a conditional use permit is denied, the
use shall cease, and water service may be terminated and not reinstated until a
lawful use is established on the premises, and no certificate of occupancy
shall be issued for structures unless a lawful use of said structures is
verified through the planning and development services department.
      10.   Enforcement: Contract-zoning agreements may be enforced by the city
through any means deemed to be appropriate, including, but not limited to,
specific enforcement, termination of water service, injunctive relief, monetary
damages, criminal penalties, and/or termination. Such enforcement options shall
not be considered exclusive, but may be combined as deemed appropriate. (Ord.
3044, 2020: Ord. 2931, 2014: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.02.180: INTERPRETATIONS:
   A.   Authority: The director shall have the authority to make
interpretations of the text of this title and the boundaries of zoning
districts on the official zoning map.
   B.   Initiation: An interpretation may be requested by any person.
   C.   Procedures:
      1.   Submission Of Request For Interpretation: Before an interpretation
may be provided by the director, a written request for interpretation must be
submitted to the director in a form established by the director.
      2.   Rendering Of Interpretation: Upon receipt of a complete request for
interpretation, the director shall review and evaluate the request in light of
the terms and provisions of the zoning ordinance and/or the official zoning
map, whichever is applicable, and render an interpretation. The director may
consult with the city attorney and other city departments before rendering an
interpretation.
      3.   Form: The interpretation shall be in writing and shall be sent or
delivered to the applicant at the applicant's address on the request for
interpretation. Interpretations that are not in writing shall have no force or
effect. Interpretations shall be made on a case by case basis and have no
precedential value. Interpretations shall be limited in their application to
the property specifically identified.
      4.   Official Record: The director shall maintain an official record of
all interpretations in the department. Such official record shall be available
for public inspection during normal business hours upon written request.
      5.   Appeal: Appeals of any interpretation under this section shall be
made in accordance with section
 17.02.400, "Appeals", of this chapter.
   D.   Rules For Interpretation Of Boundaries: Interpretations regarding
boundaries of zoning districts on the official zoning map shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      1.   District Regulations Extend To All Portions Of District: Except as
otherwise specifically provided, a district symbol or name shown within
district boundaries on the official zoning map indicates that district
standards and other district regulations pertaining to the district extend
throughout the whole area surrounded by the boundary line.
      2.   Boundaries: Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning
districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
         a.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines
of dedicated streets, highways, alleys or rights of way shall be construed as
following such centerlines as they exist on the ground, except where such
interpretation would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case
the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the
zoning status of any lot or parcel. In case of a street vacation, the boundary
shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the
vacated street is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary
shall be construed as moving with the ownership.
         b.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public
property lines, etc., shall be construed as following such lines; provided,
however, that where such boundaries are adjacent to a dedicated street, alley,
highway, or right of way and the zoning status of the street, highway, alley,
or right of way is not indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running
to the middle of the street, highway, alley, or right of way. In the event of
street vacation, interpretation shall be as provided in subsection D2a of this
section.
         c.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall
be construed as following such city limits.
         d.   Boundaries indicated as following the centerlines of streams,
canals, or other bodies of water shall be construed as following such
centerlines. In case of a change of the course or extent of bodies of water,
the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the change, except where such
movement would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel; and in such case
the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the
zoning status of any lot or parcel.
         e.   Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than
those listed above shall be construed as following such physical features,
except where such interpretation from mapped location would change the zoning
status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be interpreted in
such manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel.
         f.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in subsections D2a through D2e of this section shall be construed as
being parallel to or extensions of such features.
         g.   Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map
shall be determined by the scale of the map on the page of the official zoning
map showing the property in question.
   E.   Division Of A Lot Of Record By A Boundary: Where a district boundary
divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, and where the
division makes impractical the reasonable use of the lot, the boundary may be
adjusted by the director in either direction not to exceed fifty feet (50')
beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
   F.   Nonregulated Land Transfers: Abutting portions of lots may be
transferred to adjoining property owners without being subject to subdivision
requirements; provided, however, that no such transfer shall imply or confer
any right to develop, or create a new lot, create or increase a nonconformity
of any nature whatsoever, or circumvent the intent or requirements of this
code. (Note: This type of transfer is commonly known as a "lot line adjustment"
even though the platted lot lines are not changed and cannot be changed except
through platting.) (Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.02.200: LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the land use and development review process is
to ensure adequate opportunity for thorough review of development proposals.
   B.   Land Use And Development Subject To Review: The following land uses and
development shall be subject to review:
      1.   All proposed uses or developments subject to a building permit, in
all zoning districts.
      2.   All proposed uses involving land subdivision.
      3.   All proposed uses that change or alter the use of land or the use of
existing structures on the land.
      4.   All uses in any zoning district subject to an overlay area.
      5.   All churches, schools, or other public or quasi-public use or
development.
      6.   All planned unit developments and neighborhood refinement plans.
      7.   All land use and development matters subject to hearing examiner or
planning and zoning commission review.
   C.   Information Required: All proposals for land use and development
approvals must follow the appropriate protocol procedures and provide all
information required by the protocols adopted and in use at the time the
application is submitted. For land use and development proposals which require
special permitting (subdivisions, rezoning requests, planned unit developments,
annexation requests, conditional use permits, and variances), the appropriate
land use application form and all materials required of that application also
must be submitted by the deadlines as established by the director. (Ord. 2846 §
1, 2008)
17.02.300: DECISION MAKING PROCEDURES/PUBLIC HEARINGS:
   A.   Purpose, Application, And Public Notice Requirement:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter shall be to provide interested
persons an opportunity to be heard, to provide a clear and open decision making
process, and to satisfy the requirements of Idaho Code.

17.03.100: ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS:
   A.   Zoning Map: The boundaries of zoning districts are hereby established
as shown on a map entitled the "Zoning Map Of The City Of Pocatello, Idaho."
The map may be periodically amended and is hereby made a part of this title by
reference. Where uncertainty exists regarding a zoning district boundary, an
interpretation shall be made in accordance with section
17.02.180 of this title.
   B.    Zoning Districts And Standards: The zoning districts and standards set
forth in this title are the development standards and requirements that apply
to land located within a specified zoning district. The standards are organized
by zoning district and specify the purpose of each zoning district, the uses
allowed in each district, and other standards and criteria that apply. Unless
otherwise noted, the standards contained in this chapter are declared to be
minimum standards. (Ord. 3044, 2020)
17.03.200: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of residential zoning districts is to promote the orderly
development and maintenance of livable, peaceful and attractive neighborhoods
where residents can live their home life with a minimum of disturbance and
disruption. Residential neighborhoods are to be developed to be pedestrian
friendly. Only such uses as may not interfere unreasonably with the enjoyment
of normal home activities shall be permitted. Standards are designed to
encourage residential development and non-residential development (schools,
churches, parks and recreation facilities, daycare centers, neighborhood
commercial uses, and other services) that are compatible. Non- residential
development is to be at appropriate locations and scale.
      Furthermore, the purpose of residential zoning is to create an
environment in which construction of a full range of owner occupied and rental
housing at affordable prices is encouraged. This can be accomplished by
providing residential zoning districts of varying densities, encouraging
innovative design, and providing reasonable development standards to encourage
construction of affordable housing.
   B.   The purpose of the commercial and mixed use zoning districts is to
provide a range of commercial services for community residents. Commercial and
mixed use zoning districts are intended to promote the availability of a full
range of retail and office uses that are available throughout the city, so that
residents can fulfill all or most of their needs within easy driving, walking
and/or biking distance of their homes. The location of each commercial district
shall be carefully selected, and designed according to development standards
created to minimize the potential adverse impacts of commercial activity on
established residential areas. Mixed use areas are intended to include
residential, commercial and institutional activities, and may be located in new
and redeveloping commercial areas and near residential districts where
appropriate. A further purpose of these regulations is to promote a full range
of economic activities and job opportunities within the city limits, in
compliance with the economic goals of the comprehensive plan.
   C.   The purpose of the industrial districts is to designate areas where a
range of industrial services and employment for city residents are permitted.
The regulations governing development in industrial and employment zoning
districts are to ensure that a full range of job opportunities is available
throughout the city so that residents can work close to home if they choose.
Design guidelines and development standards are established to minimize the
potential adverse impacts of industrial activity on residential areas. A
further purpose of these regulations is to ensure that there is a full range of
economic activities and job opportunities within the city limits, in compliance
with the economic development goals of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 3044,
2020)
17.03.300: LIST OF ZONING DISTRICTS:
   A.   Residential Estate District (RE): The RE zoning district is designed
primarily to accommodate detached single-family dwellings with or without
accessory dwelling units. Open space, park lands, and neighborhood recreation
areas are encouraged. Some civic and institutional uses are also conditionally
permitted.
   B.   Residential Low Density District (RL): The RL zoning district is
designed to accommodate single-family dwellings and a mix of other housing
types such as accessory dwellings, townhomes, and two-family dwellings.
Neighborhood park and recreation areas are encouraged. Some civic and
institutional uses are also conditionally permitted.
   C.   Residential Medium Density Single-Family District (RMS): The RMS zoning
district is designed to accommodate single-family dwellings, and a mix of other
housing types such as accessory dwellings, townhomes, and two-family dwellings.
Development standards for this zoning district promote pedestrian travel to a
variety of neighborhood services within close proximity. Neighborhood park and
recreation areas are encouraged. Some civic and institutional uses are also
conditionally permitted.
   D.   Residential Medium Density Multi-Family District (RMM): The RMM zoning
district is designed to accommodate a mix of housing types including single-
family dwellings, townhomes, two-family dwellings, multi-family dwelling units
(apartments), condominiums and accessory dwellings. Development standards for
this zoning district promote pedestrian travel to a variety of neighborhood
services within close proximity. Neighborhood park and recreation areas are
encouraged. Some civic, institutional and neighborhood commercial uses are also
conditionally permitted.
   E.   Residential High Density District (RH): The RH zoning district is
designed to accommodate a variety of housing types including single-family
dwellings, two-family dwellings, accessory dwellings, multi-family dwelling
units (apartments), townhomes, and condominiums. Development standards for this
zoning district promote pedestrian travel to a variety of neighborhood services
within close proximity. Neighborhood park and recreation areas are encouraged.
A limited amount of neighborhood commercial, civic, and institutional uses are
permitted outright. Other civic and institutional uses also are conditionally
permitted.
   F.   Residential/Commercial/Professional District (RCP): The RCP zoning
district is intended to accommodate a mix of residential, professional office,
and neighborhood commercial uses including business/professional services,
convenience retail, personal services, and restaurants, in close proximity to
residential areas and major transportation facilities. Residential uses are
permitted consistent with the density and requirements of the RH zoning
district. Heliports, medical centers, and some utilities are conditionally
permitted. Developments in the RCP zoning district may be used to serve as a
buffer between residential areas and commercial and/or industrial areas.
   G.   Commercial General District (CG): The CG zoning district is designed to
accommodate a full range of retail, office and civic uses with a citywide and/
or regional trade area. Residential uses are permitted provided that buildings
maintain ground floor commercial storefronts. A wide range of higher intensity
uses, including, but not limited to, self-service storage, utilities,
heliports, and major event entertainment, are conditionally permitted.
   H.   Central Commercial District (CC): The CC zoning district is designed to
provide a concentrated central business district, centered in the city's
historic downtown, including a mix of civic, retail, and office uses.
Residential uses are permitted provided buildings maintain ground floor
commercial storefronts. A wide range of uses, including, but not limited to,
facilities with drive-up windows, major event entertainment facilities, and
gasoline stations, are conditionally permitted. Some properties in this zoning
district are further subject to the standards of the historic preservation
overlay (see section
17.04.210 of this title).
   I.   Office Park District (OP): The OP zoning district provides appropriate
locations for combining light industrial, office, business, research and
development activities, and secondary small scale commercial uses that serve
the employees and businesses in the office park zone, e.g., hotels,
restaurants, daycare, personal services and fitness centers, in a campus like
setting. Only those light industrial uses with no off-site impacts, e.g.,
noise, glare, odor, vibration, are permitted in the OP zoning district. In
addition to mandatory site development review, design and development standards
in the OP zoning district have been adopted to ensure that developments will be
well integrated, attractively landscaped, and promote pedestrian travel.
   J.   Light Industrial District (LI): The LI zoning district provides
appropriate locations for general industrial uses including industrial service,
light industrial production, research and development, warehousing and freight
movement, and wholesale sales activities with minimal impacts on neighboring
properties due to nuisance characteristics such as noise, glare, odor, and
vibration.
   K.   Industrial District (I): The I zoning district provides appropriate
locations for intensive industrial uses including industrial service,
manufacturing and production, warehousing and freight movement, railroad yards,
waste related, and wholesale sales activities. Activities in the I district
include those which involve the use of raw materials, require significant
outdoor storage and generate heavy truck and/or rail traffic. Because of these
characteristics, industrially zoned property should be carefully located to
minimize impacts on established residential, commercial, and light industrial
areas. (Ord. 3044, 2020)
17.03.400: SPECIAL BASE ZONING DISTRICTS:
Special base zoning districts are those zoning districts that have a unique
application in the community and are associated with land and facilities that
are in a fixed location. The purpose of each special base zoning district is
usually tied to a master plan for a facility or property. (Ord. 3044, 2020)
17.03.410: AIRPORT DISTRICT (A):
   A.   Purpose: The airport district (A) is established to provide for the
aesthetic enhancement and orderly development and maintenance of uses within
the city of Pocatello's regional airport and the surrounding area. The
development of such properties will address the following goals:
      1.   Create an aesthetically attractive business environment.
      2.   Provide a mix of land uses that offer a variety of services for
airport visitors, corporate and business offices, and the general public.
      3.   Promote the Pocatello Regional Airport as a regional aviation
center.
   B.   Master Plan: The currently adopted airport master plan (for lands not
governed by FAA regulations) is the document that governs and directs the
improvement and growth of the physical airport. The type of uses proposed shall
be reviewed and approved by the airport committee, and processed as set forth
under the adopted master plan. (Ord. 3044, 2020)
17.03.420: PUBLIC LANDS/FACILITIES DISTRICT (PLF):
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the Public Lands/Facilities District is to
satisfy general public needs by reserving land to accommodate public utilities,
facilities, resource protection areas, and/or other public infrastructure
deemed to be of local, regional, state, or national importance.
   B.   Permitted Land Uses: Permitted uses include, but are not limited to,
public uses, agriculture/horticulture, cemeteries, detention facilities,
heliports, and wireless communication facilities.
   C.   Review Procedures: As a result of the potentially large size and unique
operational characteristics of certain public facilities and their attendant
impacts on other property and the natural environment, all site development
proposals shall require specific approval from the city council after public
hearing, review, and recommendation from the planning and zoning commission.
Notices and public hearing procedures shall be as outlined in section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings," of this title.
   D.   Standards: All uses within this district shall be designed and built in
a manner so as to minimize any dangerous, injurious, noxious, or otherwise
objectionable fire, explosive, radioactive or other hazardous condition; noise
or vibration; smoke, dust, odor or other form of air pollution; electrical or
other disturbance; glare or heat; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other
substances, conditions or elements in a manner or amount as to adversely affect
the surrounding area. (Ord. 3044, 2020)
17.03.430: UNIVERSITY DISTRICT (U):
   A.   Zoning Map Designation: The University District is defined as those
lands depicted as such on the zoning map, encompassing properties either owned
by or under the control of Idaho State University and/or comprising the
university's campus at the time this title was adopted.
   B.   Development Plan: Land use on the campus of Idaho State University is
governed by state law and the university's development plan. All development is
approved, permitted, and regulated by state authority and is to be in
accordance with the overall campus development plan, which shall be submitted
for city review and comment upon initial creation and/or amendment.
   C.   Development Review: All development proposals shall be reviewed by the
city's site plan review committee. Comments and recommendations shall be
forwarded to university officials for consideration. If, in the determination
of the city, the proposal is deemed detrimental to the public's health, safety,
and welfare, or if the development and its implementation will have adverse
impacts on existing or planned public facilities of the city, then the city may
refuse to provide city services to said facilities and/or pursue any other
remedy provided by law.
   D.   Changes To Zoning Map Designations: If Idaho State University
relinquishes ownership of property to another owner then the special base
zoning district designation, University, becomes immediately null and void.
After such nullification the property shall be assigned an appropriate zoning
district designation, after hearing in accordance with the hearing process for
rezoning requests as outlined in section
17.02.300, "Decision Making Procedures/Public Hearings," of this title and in
accordance with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan and the
provisions of this title. (Ord. 3044, 2020)

17.04.100: RESOURCE PROTECTION OVERLAY (RPO):
17.04.110: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the RPO is to implement goals and objectives contained in the
comprehensive plan related to protection of the area's important environmental
resources, such as significant natural and archaeological features, water
resources, and wildlife habitat protection areas, while still allowing property
development in a manner consistent with its zoning designation and in a manner
that offers the best protection possible to the designated resources. This
overlay establishes procedures to enable the applicant and city to achieve the
mutually compatible objectives of reasonable use of land and protection of
vital resources.
(Ord. 3155, 2025: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.120: APPLICABILITY:
The provisions of this overlay shall apply to all development that may
physically alter lands located within the resource protection overlay as
designated on the Sensitive Lands Map and other applicable maps of the
Comprehensive Plan. All development plans shall be designed to reduce potential
disturbance to any protected resources, through the use of buffers,
conservation easements, and creative land development techniques. The overlay
specifically applies to designated natural and archaeological features;
wildlife habitat protection areas; streams and other open waters, including the
Portneuf River; wetlands; and riparian areas. In the event of overlapping
standards, the most restrictive shall apply. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the overlay or where there appears to be a conflict
between the mapped boundary and actual field conditions, an interpretation may
be requested according to the terms of section
17.02.180 of this title.
(Ord. 3155, 2025: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.130: LAND ANNEXATIONS:
Because of the importance of land located in the RPO, in the event of
application for annexation, the city may request the opportunity to obtain a
conservation easement for the purposes stated in section
17.04.110 of this chapter, as deemed appropriate by the Pocatello city council.
(Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.140: REVIEW REQUIRED:
All development affecting lands within the RPO shall be reviewed in accordance
with the site plan procedures set forth in section
17.02.500, "Site Plan Review Committee", of this title. A preapplication
meeting is required for all land development applications with an RPO
designation. The meeting shall be used to determine the applicability of the
provisions of this chapter; determine the need for specific studies as set out
in this chapter; and identify the review process. No activity shall be
undertaken until all appropriate permits have been obtained. Approval for
subdivisions and/or other land development activities shall not be granted
unless the applicant has complied with the requirements set forth in this
chapter.
(Ord. 3155, 2025: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.04.150: WATER RESOURCE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: Standards relating to protection of the area's water resources
are designed to help resolve conflicts between development and conservation of
significant city wetlands, streams, and riparian corridors. The intent of this
section is to allow reasonable economic use of property while establishing
clear and objective standards to:
      1.   Protect significant wetlands and streams;
      2.   Manage development in designated riparian corridors;
      3.   Maintain and enhance water quality;
      4.   Preserve native plant cover;
      5.   Encourage stream bank protection from erosion;
      6.   Maintain and enhance fish and wildlife habitats; and
      7.   Conserve scenic, recreational, and educational values of water
resource areas identified in this chapter.
   B.   General Provisions: All applications for development that may impact
designated water resources shall be subject to review by the site plan review
committee. A permit shall be required for all structures and all development,
including grading, excavation, fill, and other activities; except that no city
permit shall be required for allowed vegetation management (state or federal
permits may still be required). The appropriate permit shall be obtained before
construction or development begins in an area or on a parcel affecting
delineated water resources within the RPO. An application shall not be deemed
complete until the applicant has addressed all applicable development
standards. For construction or development in significant riparian corridors,
the permit application shall include an erosion control plan that identifies
the specific measures to be implemented before, during, and after construction
to protect the riparian area and adjacent upland areas from erosion, siltation,
and the effects of deleterious construction materials.
   C.   Applicability: The provisions of this section shall apply to all
development that may physically alter lands identified as protected water
resources, including open water, significant wetlands, and riparian corridors,
as designated on the official city of Pocatello zoning map, comprehensive plan
natural features overlay map, national wetland inventory (NWI) maps, and/or
other maps as referenced and incorporated or as amended. Riparian corridors
within the city include, but are not limited to, the Portneuf River and its
tributaries.
   D.   Setback Requirements:
      1.   Significant Wetlands: A minimum fifty foot (50') setback shall be
maintained from the edge of all wetlands identified on either city of Pocatello
zoning or comprehensive plan maps and/or NWI maps. Site specific delineations
may be necessary to determine the exact location of the boundary of the
significant wetland. Qualified individuals using a method acceptable to the
U.S. army corps of engineers (COE) shall perform site specific delineations.
Where a wetland delineation is prepared, the mapping it contains shall replace
that of the NWI for the purposes of this section.
      2.   Significant Riparian Corridors: A minimum fifty foot (50') setback
shall be maintained from the edge of all riparian corridors identified on city
of Pocatello zoning or comprehensive plan maps, except for channelized portions
of the Portneuf River (see subsection 17.04.160E of this chapter). A
significant riparian corridor shall consist of the water area and banks of the
riparian area. Where a significant riparian corridor includes all or portions
of a significant wetland, the width shall be measured from the farthermost edge
of the wetland and/or riparian area.
   E.   Restricted Uses And Activities: The following uses and activities shall
be restricted in significant wetlands, significant aquifer areas, associated
buffers and significant riparian corridors, and shall not be undertaken without
the appropriate review and approval per city, state, and/or federal
regulations.
      1.   Excavation solely for the purpose of removal of gravel, aggregate,
sand, minerals, or other inorganic or organic materials shall not be permitted;
      2.   Removal of native plant species without approved replacement or
mitigation;
      3.   Placement of new structures or impervious surfaces not associated
with permitted development;
      4.   Grading and placement of fill not associated with permitted
development;
      5.   Application or use of pesticides, herbicides, soil amendments, or
fertilizers;
      6.   The placement of garbage, lawn or yard debris, or other unauthorized
materials; and
      7.   Storage of materials detrimental to water quality including, but not
limited to, caustic substances, acidic substances, petroleum products,
herbicides, pesticides, etc., in quantities greater than fifty (50) gallons,
unless a containment plan has been submitted to and approved by the designated
city official.
   F.   Development Standards:
      1.   General: In addition to the standards of the underlying zoning
district, the following standards shall apply to all uses and activities
potentially affecting designated water resources. If a conflict occurs between
these standards and the underlying zoning district or other terms of this
chapter or this code, the more restrictive standards shall apply. Development
may also be subject to specific standards in subsequent sections of this
chapter.
      2.   Standards:
         a.   Within fifty feet (50') of any protected water resource,
excavation and vegetation removal shall be prohibited on slopes of twenty five
percent (25%) or greater, except where necessary to construct public facilities
or to improve slope stability;
         b.   Cuts and/or fills, when permitted, shall be subject to the
following standards:
            (1)   All fill material shall be clean and free of contaminants,
such as any inorganic matter (concrete slabs, rebar, etc.) and significant
organic matter (tree limbs, refuse, waste debris, etc.);
            (2)   Cuts and/or fills shall be designed in a manner that does not
increase the potential for flooding on adjacent or nearby flood prone lands,
and avoids restricting the flow of water to or through other land and protected
resources; and
            (3)   Cut and/or fill slopes shall be revegetated within the
immediate growing season with native plant species or approved alternatives
according to a city approved revegetation plan to stabilize the slopes.
   G.   Vegetation Management Standards: Planting of new vegetation within a
significant wetland, associated buffers, or riparian corridor shall be
permitted in accordance with current city standards or as approved by city
staff for the following:
      1.   The planting is part of an approved restoration, enhancement,
mitigation, or erosion control plan; or
      2.   The planting is part of a landscape plan using appropriate native
species or approved alternatives, and the plan is approved by the city in
conjunction with approval of a building permit; or

area of the proposed district. Owners of property on the National Register of
Historic Places may also petition for local designation as a historic property/
landmark under this chapter. Upon receipt of such a request, if survey and
nomination reports are not available, the historic preservation commission
shall make an investigation of the historic, architectural, archaeological, and
cultural significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites, or
surroundings proposed for designation, based on the criteria set forth in this
chapter. Upon completion of this investigation, the historic preservation
commission shall prepare a report containing its findings and recommendations
concerning the area proposed for designation.
      2.   Copies of the report shall be transmitted to the city council and to
the applicant(s), if any. A hearing shall be scheduled before the city council
within forty five (45) days of the date of submission of the report. Notice of
the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be given at least fifteen
(15) days prior to such hearing by one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city and by a written notice of such hearing by first class
mail to the owners of all properties proposed for designation.
      3.   Council action may take any of the following forms:
         a.   Approval of the designation as presented;
         b.   Rejection of the designation;
         c.   Approval of the designation, with modifications.
Regardless of which of the aforementioned options is chosen, the council shall
prepare formal findings of fact and conclusions setting forth their decision
and the reasons therefor.

of the ordinance and a list of addresses affected by the designation to the
building department and shall also maintain a register of such properties,
landmarks, and districts.
   E.   Selection Criteria For Locally Designating Districts And Individual
Property/Landmarks: Any site, building, group of buildings, structure or object
may be recommended by the historic preservation commission for preservation as
a local historic property, landmark or district if it:
      1.   Has significant character, interest or value as part of the
development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the city, state or nation;
      2.   Is associated with the life of a person significant in the past;

characteristic, represents an established and familiar visual feature of the
neighborhood, community, or city, such as "Red Hill" on the Idaho State
University campus;
      8.   Has yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in
prehistory or history.
   F.   Amendment Or Rescission Of Designation:
      1.   If any building, structure, site, object, area of historical
importance, or district which has been designated as a historic property,
landmark, or district has ceased to comply with the necessary criteria or no
longer exhibits the characteristics which qualified it for designation,
consideration of amendment or rescission may be requested by an individual
property owner or a majority of property owners within a district, the historic
preservation commission, or the city council. The historic preservation
commission may recommend that such property or properties be excluded from the
boundary of the district, or if the district as a whole no longer meets such
criteria, the historic preservation commission may recommend rescission of the
historic designation.
      2.   The procedure with respect to rescission or amendment of historic
designation shall be the same as that required for the original designation.
      3.   The historic preservation commission may, at its own expense, secure
its own professional evaluation. The owner shall provide access for such an
evaluation during normal business hours or at such time as is mutually
agreeable, or the request may be denied.

developments with a building footprint of less than ten thousand (10,000)
square feet, except for motor vehicle sales.
         c.   Rounding Down: If any use requires one-half (½) or more of a
parking space, the parking requirement shall be rounded down to the lesser
number of spaces.
         d.   Location of Parking Facilities: Parking areas, traffic
circulation, and drive-thrus shall not be located between the front building
facade and the front lot line. Required parking spaces may be located on
another parcel not farther than four hundred feet (400') from the building or
use they are intended to serve, measured in a straight line in any direction
from the building.
         e.   Development shall have a minimum parking lot setback of five feet
(5') on the side yard and rear yard setbacks.
      5.   Landscaping: Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with the
following standards:

17.04.230: RESIDENTIAL STABILIZATION OVERLAY (RSO):
Because of changing surroundings, certain established residential areas require
special attention to both their existing and future land uses. These
residential neighborhoods and street corridors are identified on the
development overlay map of the comprehensive plan because encroachment of
nonresidential uses could adversely affect established neighborhoods.
Therefore, those residential areas for which a change from established land
uses could prove detrimental to a particular corridor, neighborhood, or its
surrounding neighborhood shall be given a residential stabilization overlay
designation (RSO). The emphasis for areas designated RSO shall be maintenance
and rehabilitation of existing structures in a manner consistent with the
existing zoning designation.
   A.   Zoning District Amendments: No zoning district change may be considered
for lands designated RSO unless preceded by a request to amend the city's
comprehensive plan land use map.
   B.   Conditional Use Permits: Conditional use permits for nonresidential use
types can be requested only on lands vacant at the time of adoption of this
code or in structures not originally constructed or used for residential
purposes.
   C.   Nonresidential Uses: Nonresidential uses in residential zoning
districts, including parking lots for uses permitted in residential zoning
districts, shall not be permitted.
   D.   Applicability: The provisions of the RSO are to be applied in
conjunction with the provisions of the underlying zoning district and any other
applicable overlay areas. Where the provisions of the RSO and other standards
conflict, the requirements of the RSO shall apply. (Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2846

17.05.100: SLOPE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
17.05.110: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the slope development standards is to protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants by establishing
standards for development in sloped areas within the city of Pocatello. The
standards are also intended to protect and maintain the scenic beauty of the
hillsides within and surrounding the community. The standards are intended to
encourage development that is compatible with the character of existing
topography and existing vegetation. Sloped lands possess different
characteristics than flat lands; therefore it is necessary to impose special
regulations to minimize slope and soil instability, erosion, sedimentation, and
water runoff, and to protect the water quality and the natural character of
sloped areas. The purpose of these standards is to:
   A.   Preserve open space surrounding and within the city by encouraging
development in less steep areas and by encouraging clustering.
   B.   Protect steeper slopes from excessive grading and overdevelopment.
   C.   Control, manage, and minimize erosion.
   D.   Provide for specialized review of development proposals in more steeply
sloped areas to identify potential geologic hazards.
   E.   Assess uses and activities on sloped lands that may adversely affect
slope stability.
   F.   Assess uses and activities on sloped lands that may adversely affect
water resources.
   G.   Promote the preservation of the scenic character of hillsides.
   H.   Maintain the visual asset of hillsides by limiting cuts, fill,
retaining walls, escarpments, and vegetation removal. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.120: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Steep Slopes And Potentially Hazardous Area: The provisions of this
section shall apply to all development regardless of zoning designation where
topographical slopes in excess of fifteen percent (15%) as exist as of the date
of adoption hereof and/or when areas are identified as potentially hazardous by
a licensed geologist, geological report, or inventory of hazards. If a conflict
occurs between this chapter and other standards of this code, the more
restrictive shall apply.
   B.   Review Required: All development of lands where the topographical slope
exceeds fifteen percent (15%) shall be reviewed in accordance with the site
plan review procedures set forth in section
17.02.200 of this title. For all such lands, the requirements of this section
shall be met prior to city approval of any development activities, including,
but not limited to:
      1.   Building permits;
      2.   Grading, including filling and excavation;
      3.   Removal of vegetative cover;
      4.   Placement of any temporary or permanent prefabricated structures;
      5.   Storage, temporary or permanent, of any materials;
      6.   Land use or development applications, such as subdivisions, planned
unit developments, etc.;
      7.   Construction, reconstruction, or alterations to infrastructure,
including on site sewage disposal systems;
      8.   Realignment, widening or extensions to existing public or private
roads;
      9.   Construction of any new public or private street; and
      10.   Recreational activities and uses which may destroy vegetation or
create soil erosion.
   C.   Exemptions: The following activities and uses are exempt from the
provisions of this section:
      1.   Existing and ongoing agricultural activities;
      2.   Renovation or alterations to existing structures that do not involve
removal of vegetation, grading, excavation, or the depositing of fill;
      3.   Maintenance and repair of existing streets and associated drainage
systems provided the project does not extend outside previously disturbed
areas;
      4.   Removal of invasive or noxious vegetation (as defined by the city or
county);
      5.   Minimal disturbances for the purposes of site investigation required
by local, state, or federal agencies, such as soil borings and test pits,
provided disturbed areas are immediately restored upon completion of the work;
      6.   Uses or developments for which approval or a valid permit was
obtained from the city prior to the adoption of this chapter; and
      7.   Emergency actions taken or authorized by a public agency to protect
public health, safety or general welfare. (Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1,
2008)
17.05.130: REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   Preapplication Conference: The applicant shall meet with planning and
public works staff prior to submittal of development applications. The purpose
of the conference shall be to determine the applicability of the provisions of
this chapter, the need for specific geologic or other studies, and identify the
applicable review process.
   B.   Required Development Submittals: In addition to other information
required by this code, applicants must include the following additional
information in their submittal. All documents and/or other required submittals
shall be prepared by an appropriately licensed individual. The submittal shall
consist of a combination of textual and graphical information necessary to
assess the development suitability of the site. For subdivision applications,
this information shall be submitted at the preliminary plat stage. The

report shall include all current city requirements, including a plan of
mitigation for any geotechnical problems identified during the evaluation. The
report shall be prepared at the applicant's expense. A designated city official
shall review the geotechnical report. If the city accepts the report, a
development proposal may proceed through the review process. If the designated
city official determines a more detailed analysis is necessary, a revised
geotechnical report must be submitted for approval.
Any project which includes a grading or earthwork component in the city of
Pocatello shall require construction material testing and ongoing risk
assessment, performed by a registered professional geologist or engineer,
licensed in the state of Idaho, during grading and construction of
infrastructure.

percent, fifteen (15) to 24.9 percent, twenty-five (25) to 34.9 percent, and
thirty five percent (35%) or greater. The map shall be made by a professional
land surveyor who shall ensure that the quality of the map meets the standards
of the American Council Of Surveying And Mapping and the American Society Of
Civil Engineers. When preparing the slope analysis, areas of un-natural slope
and/or which have been previously disturbed as verified by an appropriately
licensed individual and accepted by the Director or designee, may be excluded
from the calculations set forth in
Table 17.05.140 Density and Disturbance Standards.
      3.   Geologically Hazardous Areas: Location of areas where landslides or
avalanches pose a moderate or severe risk or other areas characterized by
unstable slopes, unstable soils, underlying geology (such as rock
outcroppings), or geologic faults.

      10.   Site Constraints: Description of how the proposed development is
designed to address site constraints identified in the required geological
assessment and a description of any proposed mitigation.
   C.   Required Subdivision Submittals: Applications for subdivisions of lands
when any topographical slope exceeds fifteen percent (15%) must submit an
application meeting the requirements of title 16 of this code in addition to
the provisions set forth in this section. (Ord. 3132, 2023: Ord. 3075, 2021:
Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.140: SITE AND BUILDING DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
This section defines applicable site and building development guidelines.
   A.   Site Plan And Building Design:
      1.   Areas disturbed by grading (e.g., cut and fill) shall be kept to a
minimum.
      2.   Development shall be concentrated on slopes less than fifteen
percent (15%) on the site, with slopes of greater than fifteen percent (15%)
remaining undisturbed to the extent possible. Maximum disturbance of the site
development area shall be as set out in table 17.05.140 of this section.
      3.   Whenever possible, structures shall be located on the natural slope
of the land or on previously disturbed areas, rather than manmade pads or
terraces.
      4.   Development shall be clustered to preserve existing topographic
features and vegetative cover.
      5.   All building permit applications for structures on lots with a
natural slope of fifteen percent (15%) or greater shall be accompanied by a
geotechnical assessment. Building locations should be designed to address
identified hazards, minimize runoff and erosion, and utilize the existing
slope. Special types of building construction, such as split pad and stepped
foundations, shall be used to minimize site disturbance and ensure that
development conforms to the land.
      6.   Native vegetation shall be retained to the extent possible, even in
identified setback areas, except where required to provide a defensible space
to minimize threat of wildfires.
      7.   Use of reflective building materials shall be avoided.
      8.   Where retaining walls or other structures are used to stabilize cuts
or fills, their design should follow the natural contours of the slope. Plans
for proposed retaining walls or structures greater than four feet (4') in
height shall be accompanied by engineered drawings meeting adopted building
codes. Multiple wall groupings shall have at least equal lateral run to
vertical rise.
   B.   Site Disturbance And Density Standards:
      1.   Projects On Steeply Sloped Lands: Projects on steeply sloped lands
shall have limited density and site disturbance based on the existing
topographical slope for the site or any portion of a site according to the
standards listed in table 17.05.140 of this section.

   Note:
       1.    “Maximum percent of site disturbance” means the total disturbed
area of alteration to the ground of the entire lot or parcel resulting from
temporary and permanent construction activities. The remaining area shall be
designated as “not to be disturbed” and identified on the plat.
      2.   Clustering: The net density allowed by the underlying zoning
district for areas having slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) which
remain undeveloped may be transferred to other areas of the development site if
clustering concepts are used and the project retains acceptable (see subsection
B5 of this section) open space.
      3.   Minimum Lot Sizes: Minimum lot sizes may be waived by up to fifty
percent (50%) and building sites may be clustered if thirty percent (30%) or
more of the site is maintained as acceptable open space (see subsection B5 of
this section). If the development contains individual lots, all required
setbacks must be maintained.
      4.   Density Bonuses: A density bonus of five percent (5%) shall be
awarded for every ten percent (10%) of the property which is dedicated (i.e.,
if maximum density per table 17.05.140 of this section is 100 dwelling units,
applicant may build 105 units if 10 percent of the property is dedicated;
applicant may build 110 dwelling units if 20 percent of the property is
dedicated, etc.), if a project retains open space in the manner and for the
purposes described in subsection B5 of this section.
      5.   Open Space Standards: In order to utilize clustering, have minimum
lot sizes waived, and/or obtain density bonuses, open space for the following
purposes shall be maintained:
         a.   Natural drainageways;
         b.   Recreational trails;
         c.   Public access to publicly owned lands;
         d.   Preservation of ridge tops and scenic features when identified on
the natural features overlay map of the comprehensive plan;
         e.   Preservation of existing vegetation;
         f.   Preservation of sensitive wildlife habitat.
The open space must be dedicated to and accepted by a public agency, or in
certain circumstances, if the land can be maintained and managed in perpetuity,
a homeowners' association.
   C.   Grading Standards:
      1.   All excavation and grading shall be by separate permit and shall
conform to the requirements of all building codes as adopted by the city and as
further regulated by this chapter. If a conflict occurs between this chapter
and any building codes as adopted, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
      2.   Grading shall be minimized; but where alterations to topography are
necessary, slopes shall be contoured to provide a smooth, gradual transition
and imitate the natural character and appearance of the existing terrain.
      3.   All development shall meet city requirements for drainage and
erosion control.
      4.   Unless approved as part of an overall development plan subject to
the provisions of this chapter, no disturbance of existing slopes of thirty
five percent (35%) or greater shall be allowed except as provided for below:
         a.   Conformance with requirements of all building codes as adopted by
the city;
         b.   The area of thirty five percent (35%) or greater slope to be
disturbed is less than ten percent (10%) of the total parcel or a maximum of
two (2) acres, whichever is greater, unless the disturbance is for construction
of recreational trails or necessary utility or road connections;
         c.   The purposes for which the area is to be disturbed cannot be
reasonably accommodated elsewhere on the parcel such as utility construction,
access roads, or street connections to abutting properties;
         d.   The area of thirty five percent (35%) or greater slope to be
disturbed contains no existing natural or manmade drainageways unless the
disturbance is for construction of recreational trails or necessary road or
utility constructions where drainageways are maintained or reestablished; and
         e.   All disturbed areas are immediately stabilized and revegetated in
accordance with an approved revegetation plan. (Ord. 3075, 2021: Ord. 2896,
2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.200: LANDSCAPING STANDARDS:
17.05.210: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the landscaping standards is to govern the protection,
installation, and long term maintenance of trees, shrubs, and other landscape
elements, and to:
   A.   Promote local environmental quality that landscaping contributes to by
purifying air, generating oxygen, contributing to groundwater recharge and
stormwater runoff retardation, and providing wildlife habitat, while at the
same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement;
   B.   Increase soil stability;
   C.   Conserve and protect water resources by encouraging the use of water
efficient landscaping plants and practices; and

17.05.300: INFILL AND REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
17.05.310: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the infill and redevelopment standards is to encourage
compatible development in established areas on vacant, under utilized, or
partially used land. Except as specifically provided in this section, the
standards and requirements of the underlying zoning regulations, other sections
of this title, and other provisions of this code shall apply. The following
standards are intended to allow greater flexibility for development to achieve
the following community objectives:
   A.   Efficient use of existing infrastructure and services (i.e., streets,
water, sewer, solid waste disposal);
   B.   Provision of affordable housing;
   C.   Accomplishment of comprehensive plan goals related to compact
development;
   D.   More efficient use of developable land;
   E.   Increased walkability and the reduction of vehicle miles traveled by
creation of a more compact form of development;
   F.   Avoidance of urban sprawl. (Ord. 3075, 2021: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.320: APPLICABILITY:
Infill and redevelopment standards shall apply only if all of the provisions of
this section are met. All infill development parcels must comply with the
requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel is located, except as
modified by the provisions of this section, which shall supersede the
requirements of the underlying zoning district. Infill development standards
may be applied to several parcels of land assembled for redevelopment only if
each individual parcel within the said assemblage meets the definition of an
infill development parcel.
The provisions of this section shall only apply to new land subdivisions and
developments that meet the criteria of section
17.05.330 of this chapter and are located within one of the following zones:
   A.   Residential estate (RE);
   B.   Residential low density single-family (RL);
   C.   Residential medium density single-family (RMS);
   D.   Residential medium density multi-family (RMM);

All infill development applications shall include documentation, provided by
the applicant, demonstrating that the proposal complies with the following
criteria:
   A.   Bound on two (2) or more sides by existing development;
   B.   Where the utilities are available in abutting streets and/or alleyways
so that extension of trunk utility lines is not required;
   C.   The project has an elevation less than or equal to 4,600';
   D.   The project is either not platted or has been platted for a minimum of
twenty-five (25) years in its current configuration from the date of
application submittal; and
   E.   The project is no larger than three (3) acres. (Ord. 3115 § 5, 2023:
Ord. 3075, 2021: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.340: GENERAL STANDARDS:
Minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zoning district may be reduced
in accordance with one of the two (2) methods described below.
   A.   Dedications In Conjunction With Land Divisions: Where land dedications
for permanent parks and open space are accepted by the city through the
subdivision or partition approval process, reductions to lot sizes shall be
permitted on a one for one basis, up to the total square footage of
dedications, subject to the following requirements:
      1.   No lot shall be reduced to less than forty percent (40%) of the
minimum lot size established by the standards of the underlying zoning district
through the application of this provision.
      2.   Text or a table describing the allocation of right of way, parks,
and permanent open space area credits among platted lots shall be recorded as
part of the plat drawings.
      3.   At the discretion of the city, permanent open space may be conveyed
to a land trust, conservancy, or other organization formed to preserve land in
an open space condition, in lieu of dedication to the public or conveyance of
title to the city.
      4.   Reduced size lots must provide a land area with dimensions
sufficient to accommodate buildings, parking lots, etc., in accordance with the
land use, setback, and other requirements of the underlying zoning district,
unless a variance is granted pursuant to the terms of section
17.02.160 of this title.
   B.   Lot Size Reduction: To make better use of land at locations where
strict application of minimum lot size requirements precludes efficient infill
and redevelopment, the size of lots within a subdivision may be reduced in
accordance with the following requirements:
      1.   Absent a variance, no lot shall be reduced to less than sixty
percent (60%) of the minimum parcel size established by the standards of the
underlying zoning through the application of this provision; and
      2.   Reduced size lots must provide a land area with dimensions
sufficient to accommodate buildings, parking lots, etc., in accordance with the
land use, setback, and other requirements of the underlying zoning district,
unless a variance is granted pursuant to the terms of section
17.02.160 of this title. (Ord. 3075, 2021: Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2846 § 1,
2008)
17.05.350: INFILL AND REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following standards are intended to ensure that infill development is
compatible with existing buildings and neighborhoods, and therefore apply to
all new residential development:
   A.   Review Process: Single-family and two-family dwellings shall meet the
standards of this section and shall be subject to review by the director.
Appeals of this decision shall be to the hearing examiner. Multi-family and
attached dwelling developments shall meet the standards of this section, and
shall be subject to review in accordance with section
17.02.500, "Site Plan Review Committee", of this title.

shall be planted in the planter strip or front yard for every thirty five feet
(35') of lot frontage.
   D.   Parking areas shall be located behind buildings wherever possible.
   E.   Multi-family developments shall include visual screening for all
mechanical, electrical, communications, and service equipment. The equipment
shall be visually screened from the public right of way by parapets, walls,
fences, landscaping, or other suitable means. (Ord. 3075, 2021: Ord. 2846 § 1,
2008)
17.05.360: RESERVED:
(Reserved by Ord. 3075, 2021)
17.05.370: APPLICATION PROCESS:
Applications for development projects wishing to utilize infill development
standards shall follow the applicable land use process, such as a subdivision
or planned unit development. The applicant shall meet with planning staff
personnel to discuss submission of the development plan and application. The
purpose of this meeting is for preliminary and informal review of the criteria
and standards, to familiarize the applicant with the pertinent land use and
development standards, and to explain the process which will be followed. (Ord.
2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.400: LIGHTING STANDARDS:
17.05.410: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the lighting standards is to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public, improve travel conditions by reducing glare, and
develop lighting practices to reduce light pollution and conserve energy
without decreasing safety, utility, or security. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.420: STANDARDS:
The following standards shall apply to all private land uses in all zoning
districts:
   A.   All lights shall be shielded in such a way as to direct all light
toward the earth's surface and away from reflective surfaces.
   B.   All lighting fixtures shall be shielded in such a way as to direct
light away from all adjacent properties, especially those developed with
residential uses.
   C.   Any canopy structure used at a business location shall have recessed
lights with diffusers that do not extend below the surface of the canopy.
   D.   Lighting in residential, residential/commercial/professional, and mixed
use zoning districts shall not exceed fifteen feet (15') in height, thirty feet
(30') in height in commercial zoning districts, and forty five feet (45') in
height in industrial zoning districts. In commercial zoning districts, lights
on poles shall be no taller than the building whose area they illuminate or as
detailed above, measured from grade to top of the structure, whichever is
shorter.
   E.   Any luminaire on a pole, stand, or mounted on a building must have a
shield, adjustable reflector, and nonprotruding diffuser.
   F.   All fixtures must meet building codes as adopted by the city.

submitted with subdivision plats. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.500: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING STANDARDS:
17.05.510: PURPOSE:
The off street parking and loading standards are established to provide minimum
standards by which off street parking and loading areas are designed,
constructed, and maintained to provide adequate parking so as not to negatively
impact adjoining properties, to provide convenient access to all land uses, and
to assist in reducing traffic congestion and safety hazards. (Ord. 2846 § 1,
2008)
17.05.520: APPLICABILITY:
Initial construction of any building or land requires conformance with the
standards outlined in this chapter for off street parking and loading areas.
Increases in building or land area require compliance with these standards in
proportion to the increased area. Changes in use require compliance with these
standards as listed in section
17.01.170 of this title.
Because of the special physical constraints in the central commercial zoning
district, and the designated Warehouse Historic District, off street parking
requirements in the aforementioned districts need not be met for any permitted
use. (Ord. 3044, 2020: Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.530: RETENTION OF EXISTING PARKING AND LOADING AREAS:
Land areas actually being used for off street parking in connection with any
building or use may not be reduced in capacity to fewer parking spaces than
required by this chapter without an exception approved by the city council.
(Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.540: REVIEW REQUIRED:
No person, firm or corporation may construct, reconstruct, alter, or surface
any parking area without first obtaining written approval from the city. (Ord.
2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.550: PLANS REQUIRED:
Two (2) copies of plans for parking area improvements are required to be
submitted to the planning and development services department. Such plans shall
include:
   A.   A plot plan on which space arrangement, vehicle and pedestrian
circulation, ingress and egress, curbing, and landscaped areas are shown.
   B.   Details of fence and wall construction and lighting installation in
accordance with applicable building and electrical codes.
   C.   Plans shall be drawn to scale and show materials of construction,
details of drainage structures, methods of disposal of surface water drainage,
provisions for protection of natural drainage to and from adjoining properties,
including any necessary easements, landscaping, lighting, and any other
information deemed necessary by the city. (Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.560: DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
All off street parking and loading areas in residential/commercial/
professional, commercial, and industrial zoning districts and all off street
parking and loading areas serving more than two (2) dwelling units in
residential zoning districts shall conform to the following design standards:
   A.   Surfacing: All parking, loading, and vehicular access areas shall be
paved, not graveled, to provide a permanent surface capable of being marked and
able to withstand the type of vehicular traffic to which such an area is likely
to be subjected. Alternative surfacing proposals shall require review and
approval by the public works and fire departments, and may require approval by
the city council.
   B.   Drainage: All paved areas shall be sloped to drain. All drainage
structure designs and methods of disposal of surface water drainage shall
conform to city standards and be approved by the city development services
engineer.
   C.   Illumination: Any illumination of off street parking and loading areas,
including vehicle service areas and drive-up facilities, shall conform to
section
 17.05.400 of this chapter.
   D.   Landscaping: Off street parking and loading areas shall be landscaped
with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and
parking lot lights. In addition, parking lots shall be shaded to reduce the
amount of absorbed and reflected heat. Landscaping shall be designed and
installed in conformance with section
17.05.200, "Landscaping Standards", of this chapter. All landscape and
pedestrian areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs.
Placement of curbs shall not encroach into required setback or required
landscape areas. Required curbs shall be constructed of concrete approved by
the city and may be either formed in place or extruded.
   E.   Placement: No on site parking, loading, service, or vehicular
circulation areas may encroach into or reduce any required setback or buffer
areas. All parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that vehicles do
not overhang or park in or over the public right of way, including sidewalks,
or use public right of way for maneuver area.
   F.   Screening: Parking lots for more than five (5) cars shall be screened
from adjacent residential zoning districts or uses by a code compliant, sight
obscuring fence at least four feet (4') in height.
   G.   Circulation: On site circulation shall be designed to protect
pedestrians and safely move vehicles. Minimum design standards for turning
radii shall comply with current American Association Of State Highway And
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for vehicles. Maneuver space and
loading/off loading areas for delivery vehicles shall not obstruct or otherwise
interfere with required parking stalls. Connections between abutting parking
areas shall be provided whenever possible.
   H.   Pavement Markings And Signage: All parking space boundaries and
directional traffic arrows shall be marked and properly maintained on the
parking lot surface. Signs that identify parking lot usage terms and
conditions, and directional signs shall conform to the standards of title 15,
chapter 15.20, "Sign Code", of this code.
   I.   Layout And Dimensions: The various dimensions for required off street
parking facilities may not be less than set forth in section
17.05.570, table
17.05.570-2 (parking lot design diagram) of this chapter. Where a private
parking lot is designed so that cars may overhang landscaped areas or sidewalks
on the same property as the private parking lot, the stall depth for standard
size cars may be reduced by two feet (2'). In areas where cars overhang a
private sidewalk or walkway, the minimum unobstructed width of the walk may not
be less than five feet (5'). In areas where cars overhang landscape areas, the
minimum width of the landscaped area may not be less than eight feet (8').
   J.   Compact Car Parking: A maximum of one or up to thirty percent (30%) of
parking spaces, whichever is greater, may be sized for compact cars. Compact
spaces may not be less than eight feet (8') wide and sixteen feet (16') deep.
   K.   Handicap Parking: A minimum of one parking stall for the handicapped
shall be provided, or as based on Americans with disabilities act requirements,
whichever is greater.
   L.   Bicycle Parking: For all parking lots requiring twenty (20) or more
spaces, a minimum of five percent (5%) of the required number of automobile
spaces or five (5) bicycle spaces, whichever is greater, shall be provided.

right of way shall be allowed in the following areas:
      1.   Warehouse historic district, specifically 1st and 2nd Avenues
extending from East Center to East Sutter and including all side streets within
said boundary, subject to review and approval by the traffic department of any
on street parking prior to work commencing. Cost of completion of the spaces
shall be at the cost of the applicant.
      2.   Downtown historic district as established by the Pocatello city
council in December 1985, or as subsequently amended.
      3.   Adjacent alleys in residential/commercial/professional and
commercial general zoning districts may be used for maneuver area for parking
lots accommodating five (5) or fewer vehicles. All standards set forth in this
section shall be adhered to. (Ord. 2896, 2011: Ord. 2846 § 1, 2008)
17.05.570: PARKING STANDARDS BY LAND USE:
The purpose of required parking spaces is to provide enough on site parking to
accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the range of uses which might
locate at the site over time. The required parking numbers correspond to use
categories, as well as specific uses, in response to this long term emphasis.
Expansion, reconstruction, or change in legal, nonconforming situations shall
be governed by the terms of section
17.01.170 of this title. The number of parking stalls required by specific land
uses is listed in table 17.05.570-1 of this section.
Up to fifty percent (50%) of required parking spaces may be provided on another
parcel not farther than five hundred feet (500') from the building or use they
are intended to serve, measured in a straight line in any direction from the
building, provided a signed agreement from the owner is obtained and the shared
parking arrangement does not reduce the owner's required parking spaces.

17.06.400: HOME OCCUPATIONS:
   A.   Intent: The intent of this section is not to allow circumvention of
zoning restrictions on commercial activity within a residential zoning
district. Rather, the intent is to provide, under limited circumstances, for
the additional use of residential properties for certain nonresidential
activities. In general, a residential structure or accessory to the residential
structure within a residential zoning district may be used for limited business
purposes only if the premises are primarily a residence whose occupants are
also conducting limited commercial activities at that location. The commercial
activity must be such that it can be conducted without negatively impacting the
health, safety or general welfare of the neighborhood, unduly increasing
traffic or noise, or substantially changing the residential character of a
neighborhood. If the home occupation does not meet these general criteria and
the standards set out below, the use is not permitted.
   B.   Standards: All home occupations shall be subject to the following
standards:
      1.   A home occupation certificate must be filed with the planning and
development services department.
      2.   The presence or pursuit of the home occupation shall not result in
any nuisance condition or excessive noise, as defined by this code, nor shall
the approval of a home occupation certificate allow circumvention of any other
city codes.
      3.   All persons involved in carrying out the home occupation, whether
family members, proprietors, partners, or co-equal shareholders, must have as
their primary residence the same dwelling unit as that housing the home
occupation, with no on site assistance from other persons or employees.
Employees who meet the business owner off site to perform work related
activities shall be permitted, provided they do not come to the home.
      4.   The dwelling unit must be suitable for use for the home occupation
without modifications except as specified hereafter. Remodeling or modification
of any portion of the dwelling unit or accessory structure to be used in the
course of the home occupation shall be prohibited if it would change the
character, use, or occupancy classification of the dwelling as set forth in the
currently adopted building code. Remodeling and modifications necessary to
accommodate handicapped persons shall be allowed, provided applicable building
permits have been issued.
      5.   No oversized vehicle as defined in section
10.08.090 of this code, or any vehicle which by virtue of dimensions, gross
vehicle weight or declared use is required by Idaho Code to display, or does
display, commercial or apportioned registration plates, may be used or stored
on site or on street in carrying out the home occupation.
      6.   No assets, inventory or raw materials used in a home occupation
shall be displayed or stored outdoors. No hazardous materials, as determined by
the Pocatello fire department, may be stored at the site of the home
occupation.
      7.   Hours of operation shall be limited to no earlier than six thirty
o'clock (6:30) A.M. and no later than nine o'clock (9:00) P.M. Outdoor

professional, office park, light industrial, industrial, airport and public
land/facility. A maximum of one tower is allowed per site.
         a.   Applicants for towers in residential zoning districts shall
provide a mailing list of owners of property adjoining the site in question.
The city shall send notice of the application to these property owners.
         b.   A twenty one (21) day waiting period shall be required prior to
the issuance of any building permit to allow any notified adjoining property
owner the opportunity to make a written request to the planning and development
services department for a hearing before a hearing examiner. The twenty one
(21) day waiting period shall begin on the day the notice of application is
deposited by the city in the U.S. mail to the adjoining property owners.
         c.   In the event a hearing is held before a hearing examiner, the
hearing examiner shall make a decision based upon the standards contained in
this section to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application for a
building permit. The applicant or other affected persons may appeal the hearing
examiner's decision to the city council in accordance with section

conversion systems, regardless of size or the zoning district location of the
WECS:
      1.   Setbacks: All WECS towers shall be set back from property lines on
all sides a minimum of the distance equal to the overall height of the WECS.
The required setback distance may be less than the overall height of the WECS
if an easement from an adjoining property owner is provided in writing and
recorded with the recorder of the county where the property is located, which
easement must provide the remaining distance required for the setback to be met
and which is not available within the WECS applicant's property boundary.
      2.   Distance Requirements From Other WECS Bases: No WECS tower shall be
erected within five (5) swept area diameters or five (5) rotor blade lengths,
whichever is greater, of another WECS base which is owned by a different party.
The swept area diameter of the larger of the two (2) WECS bases shall be used
to compute the required distance between the towers.
      3.   Warning Sign: At least one weatherproof sign no less than eight
inches by ten inches (8" x 10") in size shall be posted in conspicuous view on
the tower base or on the fenced enclosure around the tower base to warn of
hazards and to post no trespassing. No sign permit is required for the afore
described warning sign. No other signage shall be permitted on the WECS base,
tower or wind turbine.

*For existing multi-tenant properties, see section
17.07.050.G of this chapter.
   E.   Illumination.
      1.   Illumination may be internal or external, unless otherwise noted.
Lighting for all signs shall comply with lighting standards as identified in
this title.
         a.   Residential and RCP zones. External lighting fixtures shall be
fully cutoff and fully shielded. Internal lighting shall be recessed and
"blacked out" with only the message illuminated.
         b.   Commercial and Industrial zones. External lighting fixtures shall
be fully cutoff and fully shielded.
   F.   Electronic Message Centers (EMC). Signs that may contain electronic
messaging shall be permitted in accordance with the following criteria:
      1.   Messaging. Such signs shall contain static messages only and shall
not have animation. No chasing, blinking, rotating or flashing shall be
employed in displaying a message or image, or during the change from one
message or image to another. No streaming video shall be displayed.
         a.   Text messaging that is longer than the display area and does not
contain any image or graphics shall scroll in a consistent and predictable
manner.
         b.   Transitions. An automated change of message or image must be
accomplished within two (2) seconds or less and contain a default design that
will freeze the sign face in one position, should malfunction occur.
         c.   Each message or frame must be displayed for a minimum of eight
(8) seconds.
      2.   Amount. Only one (1) EMC per property shall be permitted, unless
otherwise approved through the sign master plan process.
      3.   Area. The area of an EMC shall be included in the total allowed sign
area, as identified in this chapter.
      4.   Installation. EMCs shall not be installed on a non-conforming sign.
      5.   Illumination.
         a.   EMCs shall not exceed 0.3 foot-candle over ambient lighting
conditions when measured pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.
         b.   All measurements shall be taken using a light meter and measured
in foot candles. Illumination shall be measured with an illuminance meter set
to measure foot-candles accurate to at least two (2) decimal points.
Illuminance shall be measured from an angle and distance to accomplish a base
reading, establishing the ambient lighting conditions without interference from
the EMC's light. After the base reading is established, a second reading shall
be obtained which directly measures the EMC's light to determine if it exceeds
0.3 foot-candle over ambient light.
         c.   All EMCs shall be installed with an automated dimmer control or
similar device which automatically determines the ambient illumination and
programmable to automatically dim according to the ambient light conditions, or
that can be adjusted to comply with the standards set forth in this subsection.
         d.   Curfew. All electronic message displays located in a Residential
or RCP zone shall not be illuminated between 9:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.
   G.   Specifications for Multi-Tenant Properties.
      1.   Purpose. To ensure that signs within multi-tenant properties are
compatible with regard to design, size, locations, and materials.
      2.   Applicability.
         a.   New developments that fall under the definition of a multi-tenant
property shall submit a master sign plan, as of the effective date of this
chapter.
         b.   All signage for multi-tenant properties constructed prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall meet all applicable standards within the
underlying zone, with the following exception:
            (1)   Building sign area: Total area determined by each business
elevation, not building elevation. Refer to sign standards table within this
chapter.
         c.   Existing developments that fall under the definition of a multi-
tenant property may submit a master sign plan to receive the benefits found
within this section.
      3.   Sign Master Plan Standards. All provisions of the sign
specifications for the underlying zone shall apply, with the following
exceptions:
         a.   Sign allowance may be increased up to ten (10%) percent.
         b.   Multiple EMCs and free-standing signs may be approved with a
minimum spacing of one hundred fifty feet (150'). All EMCs and free-standing
signs shall be on the same structure.
         c.   Pad Sites. In addition to building sign allowance, one (1)
monument sign no larger than thirty-six (36) square feet in area and six feet
(6') in height are permitted for each pad site.
         d.   Change of Signs: If a sign is changed or updated, and there is an
approved sign master plan, the following procedures shall apply:
            (1)   Face Change. Face change is permitted by right, without any
permit.
            (2)   New Cabinet, Same Dimensions. If the proposed sign utilizes
the same area and location, it will be seen as a face change and shall be
permitted by right, without any sign permit. However, electrical signs may
still need an electrical permit.
            (3)   New Cabinet, Different Dimensions. If the proposed sign
changes the area and/or location, it will be seen as a new sign and will
require a new sign master plan. (Ord. 3152, 2024)
