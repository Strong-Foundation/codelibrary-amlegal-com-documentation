   (B)   All sewer service line materials and their installation shall be in
accordance with the city standard specifications of the construction of
sanitary sewers and storm sewers and the applicable standard drawings depicting
the various sewer service line installation details.
   (C)   All sewer system material shall be of the class, strength, thickness
and the like, necessary to accommodate or provide for the depth of cover over
the pipe, the type of material and bedding around the pipe, and the type,
magnitude and extent of the external loads being applied to the pipe.
   (D)   All materials must be approved by the Superintendent of Public Works.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.400) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)
§ 53.061 SEWER SYSTEM DESIGN.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The plans for all sewer lines, sewage lift stations, sewage
treatment facilities and the like, shall be designed, signed and sealed by a
registered professional engineer licensed in the state.
      (2)   All sewer lines, lift stations, sewage treatment facilities and the
like shall be designed in accordance with State Health Department requirements.
      (3)   Minimum sanitary sewer main size shall be eight-inch diameter.
Minimum storm drain size shall be eight-inch diameter. Larger sizes shall be as
required by the city’s overall sewer system master plan or as are needed to
provide adequate sewage-carrying capacity for the area (and surrounding
developable area) being developed and/or annexed to the city. Minimum building
service line size shall be four-inch diameter.
   (B)   Depth. In general, sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to receive
sewage from basements and to prevent freezing. Sewer lines shall have at least
three feet of cover (from the top of sewer line pipe to the ground or street
surface) unless a special design is approved by the City Engineer whereby the
sewer line is protected from freezing by special means or methods and the sewer
is protected from heaving by the installation of crushed gravel backfill
material under, around and over the pipe.
   (C)   Slope.
      (1)   All sewer mains shall be designed and constructed to provide mean
velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second. All sewer
service lines (side sewers) shall be designed and constructed to provide mean
velocities, when flowing full, of not less than three feet per second. The
following are minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater
than these are desirable:
         Minimum Slope in Feet Per 110 Feet      (2)   Under special conditions, if detailed
         justifiable reasons are given, slopes slightly less than those required above (i.e., to
         provide two or three feet per second velocity when flowing full) may be permitted. Such
         decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be three-tenths of the
         diameter or greater for the design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes are
         proposed, the design engineer must furnish with his or her report his or her computations of
         the depths of flow in such pipes at the minimum and average rates of flow for a typical
         day.      (3)   Sewers shall be laid with uniform slopes between manholes, i.e., a manhole
         shall be constructed at each point where the sewer line slope or grade changes.   
         (D)   Manholes. Manholes shall be located not more than 400 feet apart on lines 15 inches in
         diameter or smaller. Manholes may be located up to 600 feet apart on lines larger than 15
         inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed at all locations where sewer line eight
         inches in diameter or larger intersect, join together or make a bend. All dead-end sewer
         lines shall have a manhole installed on the end thereof.   (E)   Sewer mainline drop through
         manholes. Lateral sanitary sewer lines shall not enter a manhole at an elevation appreciably
         higher than the sewer main line. The flowline(s) of any lateral line(s) shall be positioned
         within the manhole as follows.      (1)   The flowline of the main sewer line shall be at
         least five-hundredths of a foot below the flowline of any of the lateral sewer lines
         entering the manhole. Where the diameter of the main line and the lateral line differ by
         less than five-tenths of a foot, the top of the lateral line shall be positioned even with
         the top of the main line on its high (inlet) side.      (2)   Where the diameter of the main
         and lateral differ by five-tenths of a foot or more, the eight-tenths depth points of the
         two sewer line inverts shall be positioned at the same elevation.      (3)   Where a lateral
         line should enter a manhole at an elevation of less than three feet above the main sewer
         line, the grade or slope of the lateral shall be adjusted so that its flowline is located
         (in relation to that of the main line) as indicated above.      (4)   Individual building
         service lines may not enter manholes; except that not more than two individual building
         service lines may enter a “dead-end” manhole (a manhole on the upstream and permanent end of
         a sewer line); and provided further, that the individual building service lines must enter
         the manhole at such elevation that the top of the service line is level with the top of the
         sewer main line and that the poured-in-place concrete floor of the manhole brings the
         flowlines of the service lines into the flowline of the mainline in a smooth continuous
         manner.   (F)   Sanitary sewer lines and water lines. Sanitary sewer lines and water lines
         shall, wherever possible, be located on opposite sides of the street. Preferably, water
         lines shall be located 13 feet west or north of the street centerline and the sanitary sewer
         at 13 feet east or south of the street centerline. Where storm drains are needed, these
         shall preferably be located along the street centerline. The above-referenced locations and
         dimensions may be varied to accommodate unusual circumstances; however, a ten-foot (out-to-
         out) horizontal separation between water line facilities and sewer facilities (either
         sanitary or storm) and an 18-inch (out-to-out) vertical separation between said facilities
         shall always be maintained unless a specific variance to this requirement is obtained from
         the City Engineer. The applicable separation requirements of the State Health Department
         shall also be complied with.   (G)   Drawing requirements.      (1)   All drawings shall be
         on linen or Mylar, in pencil or ink and of such quality that they clearly show the
         dimensions, locations, sizes and the like, of all facilities represented thereon. All sewer
         line manholes, inlet boxes, building service lines and the like shall be clearly shown and
         identified by name and by station or other means of horizontal location.      (2)   Sewer
         lines shall be shown in both plane and profile unless the length of said sewer line or sewer
         line extension is so short that the City Engineer waives this requirement.      (3)   If a
         profile of the sewer line is not provided, it shall be located in the vertical plane by
         elevations on the flowline of the pipe at all manholes, inlet boxes and the like, and at
         other such locations and intervals as the City Engineer may require.      (4)   Drawings
         shall be drawn on a scale of one inch equals 100 inches unless the amount of detail,
         topography and the like necessitates their being drawn on a larger scale (i.e., one inch
         equals 50 feet or one inch equals 40 feet) to provide the clarity and completeness needed on
         the drawings.   (H)   Approval. The design of all sewer lines and all sewer line plans must
         be approved by the City Engineer.(Prior Code, § 13.08.410) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)§
         53.062 AS-BUILT DRAWINGS AND ENGINEER’S CERTIFICATION.    (A)   As-built or record drawings
         of sewer line plans shall be prepared by a professional engineer, and the corrected original
         drawing(s) shall be provided to the city.   (B)   As-built plans shall include a
         certification thereon signed by the registered professional engineer in charge of the work
         that the as-built drawing of the sewer lines are true and correct and that he or she (the
         registered professional engineer) has inspected the construction of the sewer line
         installation and that the materials and installation of same were all done in conformance
         with the city, federal and state standard specifications for the construction of sanitary
         sewers and storm sewers.(Prior Code, § 13.08.420) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)§ 53.063
         DEVELOPER OR PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.    (A)   Subdivision developer’s or property
         owner’s responsibility for sewer lines.      (1)   The owner or developer of any piece of
         property or tract of land is responsible for the construction of the sewer line (or for the
         sewer line costs) along any of the property sides or frontages of the property along which a
         sewer line is needed for the overall completeness and continuity of the city’s sewer main
         system. If it is a large tract of land, the owner or developer shall also be responsible for
         the necessary and required system of sewer lines within the interior of the tract of
         land.      (2)   (a)   The owner or developer of any piece of property shall construct all
         needed sewer lines (of the approved size) within and along all sides or frontages of any
         piece of property prior to the time any building constructed thereon is occupied or utilized
         unless phased construction of the sewer main system is specifically allowed or provided for
         in the annexation or development agreement.         (b)   In lieu of actually constructing
         said required sewer line or sewer lines, the property owner or developer may deposit
         adequate moneys with the city to fully cover the cost(s) of said required sewer line
         construction.      (3)   (a)   The owner or developer of any property or subdivision will
         normally be responsible only for the cost of up to an eight-inch diameter sanitary sewer
         line. The additional cost of providing a sanitary sewer line of a size greater than eight
         inches will normally be a city responsibility. The city will reimburse the developer for the
Sewer    extra cost of the additional sanitary sewer line size (over the eight-inch diameter size
Size     referenced above) as set forth in the annexation or development agreement between the
(inches) developer and the city; provided further, however, that if any proposed subdivision or
         development is of such size or magnitude that it requires or necessitates a sewer size
         larger than an eight-inch diameter line, or if the type of development is such as to produce
         a wastewater flow in excess of the capacity of an eight-inch diameter sewer line, then the
         owner or developer of said subdivision or development shall be responsible for the entire
         cost of whatever size of sewer line is needed to accommodate his or her
         development.         (b)   The additional cost of providing any extra sewer line depth
         required by the city (over and above that sewer line depth required to adequately serve the
         owner or developer’s property when assuming at least a 12-foot sewer line depth at the
         uppermost end of the sewer line extended through or along said property) will be a city
         responsibility, and the city will reimburse the owner or developer for the cost of said
         extra depth of sewer line as agreed upon and as set forth in the annexation or development
         agreement between the developer and the city.      (4)   (a)   If the property owner or
         developer owns or is developing the property on only one side (as compared to both sides) of
         any street, alley or easement where a sewer line is located or required, he, she or they
         shall be responsible for only one-half of the cost of said sewer line while the property
         owner on the other side of said street, alley or easement shall be responsible for the other
         half of the cost of said sewer line construction. However, in the absence of any mutual
         agreement between the property owners, the city may participate with the first owner or
         developer to the extent of paying for one-half the cost of an eight-inch diameter sewer line
         across said referenced property frontage.         (b)   The second property owner will
         thereafter be responsible for reimbursing the city for his or her half of the costs of this
         sewer line construction at the time he or she (the second property owner or developer)
         begins to develop or build upon his or her property that is adjacent to the sewer line
         installed by the first property owner; provided further, however, that if the sewer line
         construction is for an area or a development that is outside of the city limits or if the
         length of the sewer line construction in which the city would be participating (as referred
         to above) exceeds 1,000 lineal feet, the city may decline to participate in the cost of said
         sewer line construction, except to pay for the extra cost differential between the size and
         depth of the sewer line required to serve the development and the actual size and depth of
         line that the city designates shall be installed to meet the requirements of its sewer
         system master plan. When this situation or set of circumstances exists, the property owner
         or developer who first initiates or actually begins the development of his or her property
         shall be responsible for “front-ending” the entire cost of the sewer line construction and
         for actually constructing said sewer line.         (c)   The second (or other) property
         owners shall thereafter be responsible for reimbursing the property owner for his, her or
         their share of the costs of the sewer line along his, her or their frontage at the time he,
         she or they (the other adjacent property owners or developers) begin to develop or build
         upon his, her or their property adjacent to the sewer line installed by the first property
         owner. In the absence of any agreement between the first property owner or developer
         covering the cost of said sewer line(s) the referenced other adjacent property owners or
         developers shall pay to the city the amount of $12 per lineal foot (or such other amount as
         the city may hereinafter establish and adopt by resolution) for the length of sewer line
         across his, her or their frontage. The city, in turn, will reimburse this same amount to the
         first party, which reimbursement shall be deemed adequate and appropriate compensation for
         his, her or their share of the cost of said sewer line.(Prior Code, § 13.08.430)   
         (B)   Subdivision developer’s or property owner’s responsibility for sewage lift
         stations.      (1)   (a)   Sewer mains shall be kept as deep as practicable to keep sewage
         lift stations to the smallest number possible.         (b)   When a sewage lift station and
         its related facilities is required, it and the sewer main system directing sewage to it
         shall generally be designed for an entire definable area and not just to serve a single
         property owner or developer.      (2)   The cost of the sewage lift station shall be
         equitably divided between the developer and the city as set forth in the annexation or
         development agreement.(Prior Code, § 13.08.440)(Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)§ 53.064 BACKFLOW
         PREVENTION DEVICES.    (A)   Device requirements.      (1)   Every sewer connection from the
         enactment of this chapter shall be equipped with a backflow prevention device, which shall
         be purchased, installed and maintained by the sewer user.      (2)   All persons presently
         connected to the sewer system are encouraged to install and maintained an approved backflow
         prevention device.      (3)   The backflow prevention device and installation shall be
         approved by the Superintendent of Public Works prior to installation.   (B)   Liability for
         damages. The city shall not be liable to any person for any damages caused directly or
         indirectly by sewage.(Ord. 552, passed 4-1-1997) Penalty, see §
         53.999 ENFORCEMENT§ 53.075 CITATION; APPEARANCE.    (A)   Whenever it is determined by any
         police officer or other duly authorized officer that any person or persons has violated any
         provisions of this chapter, the officer shall provide in quadruplicate and serve upon such
         person or persons a written citation containing a notice to appear in a designated court of
         competent jurisdiction within the city.   (B)   This citation shall contain the name and
         address of the person charged, the offense charged, the time and place when and where the
         offense charged occurred, and the time when the person charged shall appear in said court,
         and such other pertinent information as may be necessary, and such person or persons shall
         appear in said court within five days after such citation is issued and served.   (C)   The
         issuance of a citation shall not be the exclusive method of summoning offenders hereunder.
         (Prior Code, § 13.08.450) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)§ 53.076 FAILURE TO APPEAR UNLAWFUL.
            It is unlawful for any person or persons to fail or neglect to appear in response to and
         as required by the citation regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which such
         citation was originally issued. Appearance in court shall be deemed complied with upon
         appearance by the person cited or his or her attorney.(Prior Code, § 13.08.460) (Ord. 532,
         passed 5-18-1993) Penalty, see §
         53.999 RATES AND FEES§ 53.090 SYSTEM OF CHARGES.    All systems of charges and fees to
         users, within and without the city, shall assure that each recipient of wastewater
         collection and treatment services will pay its proportionate share of the costs of operation
         and maintenance (including equipment replacement) of any waste collection and treatment
         services provided by the city.(Prior Code, § 13.08.280) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)§ 53.091
         SEWER CONNECTION FEE.    (A)   Before any sewer connection permit is issued for the
         installation of any sewer service connection (side sewer), the person making the application
         therefor shall pay to the city a sewer connection fee according to the following schedule.
                                                          Minimum Slope in Feet Per 110 Feet      (2)   Under special conditions, if detailed
                                                          justifiable reasons are given, slopes slightly less than those required above (i.e., to
                                                          provide two or three feet per second velocity when flowing full) may be permitted. Such
                                                          decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be three-tenths of the
                                                          diameter or greater for the design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes are
                                                          proposed, the design engineer must furnish with his or her report his or her computations of
                                                          the depths of flow in such pipes at the minimum and average rates of flow for a typical
                                                          day.      (3)   Sewers shall be laid with uniform slopes between manholes, i.e., a manhole
                                                          shall be constructed at each point where the sewer line slope or grade changes.   
                                                          (D)   Manholes. Manholes shall be located not more than 400 feet apart on lines 15 inches in
                                                          diameter or smaller. Manholes may be located up to 600 feet apart on lines larger than 15
                                                          inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed at all locations where sewer line eight
                                                          inches in diameter or larger intersect, join together or make a bend. All dead-end sewer
                                                          lines shall have a manhole installed on the end thereof.   (E)   Sewer mainline drop through
                                                          manholes. Lateral sanitary sewer lines shall not enter a manhole at an elevation appreciably
                                                          higher than the sewer main line. The flowline(s) of any lateral line(s) shall be positioned
                                                          within the manhole as follows.      (1)   The flowline of the main sewer line shall be at
                                                          least five-hundredths of a foot below the flowline of any of the lateral sewer lines
                                                          entering the manhole. Where the diameter of the main line and the lateral line differ by
                                                          less than five-tenths of a foot, the top of the lateral line shall be positioned even with
                                                          the top of the main line on its high (inlet) side.      (2)   Where the diameter of the main
                                                          and lateral differ by five-tenths of a foot or more, the eight-tenths depth points of the
                                                          two sewer line inverts shall be positioned at the same elevation.      (3)   Where a lateral
                                                          line should enter a manhole at an elevation of less than three feet above the main sewer
                                                          line, the grade or slope of the lateral shall be adjusted so that its flowline is located
                                                          (in relation to that of the main line) as indicated above.      (4)   Individual building
                                                          service lines may not enter manholes; except that not more than two individual building
                                                          service lines may enter a “dead-end” manhole (a manhole on the upstream and permanent end of
                                                          a sewer line); and provided further, that the individual building service lines must enter
                                                          the manhole at such elevation that the top of the service line is level with the top of the
                                                          sewer main line and that the poured-in-place concrete floor of the manhole brings the
                                                          flowlines of the service lines into the flowline of the mainline in a smooth continuous
                                                          manner.   (F)   Sanitary sewer lines and water lines. Sanitary sewer lines and water lines
                                                          shall, wherever possible, be located on opposite sides of the street. Preferably, water
                                                          lines shall be located 13 feet west or north of the street centerline and the sanitary sewer
                                                          at 13 feet east or south of the street centerline. Where storm drains are needed, these
                                                          shall preferably be located along the street centerline. The above-referenced locations and
                                                          dimensions may be varied to accommodate unusual circumstances; however, a ten-foot (out-to-
                                                          out) horizontal separation between water line facilities and sewer facilities (either
                                                          sanitary or storm) and an 18-inch (out-to-out) vertical separation between said facilities
                                                          shall always be maintained unless a specific variance to this requirement is obtained from
                                                          the City Engineer. The applicable separation requirements of the State Health Department
                                                          shall also be complied with.   (G)   Drawing requirements.      (1)   All drawings shall be
                                                          on linen or Mylar, in pencil or ink and of such quality that they clearly show the
                                                          dimensions, locations, sizes and the like, of all facilities represented thereon. All sewer
                                                          line manholes, inlet boxes, building service lines and the like shall be clearly shown and
                                                          identified by name and by station or other means of horizontal location.      (2)   Sewer
                                                          lines shall be shown in both plane and profile unless the length of said sewer line or sewer

(Prior Code, § 13.08.290) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)
§ 53.092 SERVICE LINE FEES.
   At the time an applicant applies for city sewer service, a service line
installation fee shall be assessed. The service line fee is to cover the costs
incurred by the city in installing the sewer service line and shall be based on
the actual cost of labor and materials. The fees shall be reviewed from time to
time and thereafter revised by resolution of the city so that said fees and
costs adequately cover the costs actually incurred by the city in installing
these service lines.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.300) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)
§ 53.093 SERVICE CALL CHARGE.
   The Superintendent of Public Works may require a service charge in an
amount, not to exceed the actual cost to the city for service calls which are
only for the convenience and benefit of the customer.
(Prior Code, § 13.08.310) (Ord. 532, passed 5-18-1993)
§ 53.094 MONTHLY SEWER RATES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   This is a user charge system for a small community which follows
model number one in Appendix B of the Federal Register, dated September 27,
1978 (43 FR 44022). The treatment works is primarily dependent and will utilize
the equivalent use concept. The equivalent use system has been set up based on
flow.
      (2)   A sewer user charge shall be levied on all users of the sewage
collection and treatment facilities to cover the actual or estimated cost of
operation, maintenance, replacement and financing of this facility. The user
charge system shall distribute these costs to each user or user class in
approximate portion to such user’s contribution to the total wastewater load of
such facilities.
   (B)   Basis for rates. The sewer user rates for each user (or user class)
shall be based on the user’s contribution to the total wastewater loading of
the treatment facilities in comparison to a standard equivalent user as defined
below. Each user (or user class) shall be assigned a number to be multiplied by
a constant monthly rate. Special users contributing sewage of excessive flow
and/or strength, for which the tabulated equivalent users below do not apply,
shall be individually calculated as provided below. The constant monthly cost
factor shall be set by resolution of the city.
   (C)   Equivalent user. For the purpose of this section, ONE EQUIVALENT USER
means contributing 210 gallons per day of wastewater containing not more than
seven-tenths of a pound of five-day BOD and five-tenths of a pound of suspended
solids. The equivalent user flow has been developed from population and sewer
usage records which indicate an average single dwelling unit has three and one-
half people contributing 70 gallons per day per person. Standard engineering
data indicates two-tenths of a pound of five-day BOD and fourteen-hundredths of
a pound of suspended solids respectively per person per day. The basic
equivalent user shall be subject to revision if population, water usage, sewage
volume and/or other information indicates flow and/or strength significantly
different from that defined herein. Revisions of the basic equivalent user
criteria shall normally only be made upon the recommendation of a registered
professional engineer.
   (D)   Equivalent user schedule. The number of equivalent users to be
assigned each user and/or user class shall be in accordance with the following
equivalent user schedule. Assignment of equivalent users shall apply for one
year until the next annual user charge review. Users so indicated or not
included in this schedule shall be considered special users and shall be
evaluated separately as provided below. If the information indicates that the
strength of sewage contributed by any of the following users is in excess in
comparison with the allowable limits listed above, then a surcharge shall be
levied against such users as provided below. Any of the users in the following
schedule may be classified as special users if information on their
contribution flow and/or strength indicates a need to do so. A single user
having more than one classification of use shall be the sum of the fees. The
minimum monthly sewer user charge shall be one equivalent user. Equivalent user
schedule (one minimum), see Addendum 1, attached to the ordinance codified in
this chapter.
   (E)   Surcharge for excessive strength.
      (1)   When any user contributes wastewater having an average BOD and/or
suspended solids loading in excess of the designated allowable limits
hereinafter designated, a surcharge shall be levied against such user. Said
surcharge shall be based on the average degree of excess loading and applied as
a percentage of the basic user charge, as provided in the above schedule, or
otherwise for special users. The BOD and suspended solids loading shall be
determined from estimates or tests made by city officials or the City Engineer.
      (2)   The user’s monthly surcharge shall be computed by the user of the
following equation, where “US” represents the user’s monthly surcharge to be
added to the basic user’s monthly charge, “UMC” represents the basic user’s
monthly charge (for treatment only) and shall not be less than one, “b”
represents the average BOD loading above which is a user’s wastewater
contribution, expressed in parts per million, “B” represents the allowable
limit of BOD loading above which a user’s surcharge shall be levied, designated
as being 200 parts per million, “s” represents the average suspended solids
loading of the user’s wastewater contribution, expressed in parts per million,
and “S” represents the allowable limit of suspended solids loading above which
a user’s surcharge shall be levied, designated as being 140 parts per million.
      (3)   A copy of the list of users surcharged, the characteristics of
their sewage and the surcharge for each shall be kept on file at all times in
the office of the City Clerk.
   (F)   Special users.
      (1)   If, in addition to excessive strength, a user is determined to add
flow to the wastewater treatment facilities in excess of 6,500 gallons per
month, the above formula shall be increased by a factor of total flow divided
by 6,500 gallons per month multiplied by one equivalent user. In order to
determine the flow of this special user, the city may monitor sewage and water
flow in order to determine total flow. The value of UMC used in the formula
above will be the same value as assigned single dwelling units.
      (2)   A copy of the list of special users, the characteristics of their
sewage, and the special user’s monthly charge shall be kept on file at all
times in the office of the City Clerk.
   (G)   Review and revision of rates. The sewer user charges shall, as a
minimum, be reviewed annually and updated by resolution of the city to reflect
actual costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and financing of the sewage
collection and treatment facilities. Any revisions of the user charges shall be
based on actual operation, maintenance, replacement and financing expenses and/
or on significant changes in the total number of equivalent users, the total
daily flow, the total daily BOD and/or the total daily suspended solids. The
city may install flow-measuring devices and/or collect wastewater samples at
any time in any user’s service line to determine actual usage as a basis for
revisions of the user’s charge. Revisions due only to changes in expenses and
user class shall be made by the city. Revisions involving users flow, BOD and/
or suspended solids shall normally only be made upon the recommendation of a
registered professional engineer. All changes in user charges applicable to
this chapter shall be computed by the methods outlined herein.
   (H)   User request for rate change. Any sewer user who feels his or her user
charge is unjust and inequitable as applied to his or her premises within the
spirit and intent of the foregoing provisions may make written application to
the city requesting a review of his or her user charge. Said written request
shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow and strength
of his or her wastewater in comparison with the value upon which the charge is
based, including how the measurements or estimates were made. Any flow
measurements and/or testing of wastewater shall be approved in detail by the
city and/or the City Engineer. Review of the request by the city shall
determine if it is substantiated or not, including recommended further study of
the matter for the city and/or user by a registered professional engineer.
   (I)   Monthly rate. The basic rate for sewer shall be $41.50 a month.
   (J)   Connection. Any person or entity desiring to connect to the city sewer
shall pay a fee to the city prior to connection in the sum of $5,000.
      (1)   The rates and fees set forth above may be changed from time to time
by resolution of the City Council.
      (2)   Any fees or rates previously adopted and approved by the city which
vary from the rates set forth in this division (J) shall remain in full force
and effect if not altered herein.

   (A)   Whenever the city shall deem it appropriate and in the best interest
of the city and its citizens to require a user to have the sewer and/or water
service to his or her facilities metered to more appropriately determine the
amount of service provided such user by the system, the city may by resolution
require the user to install a meter and/or meters which will accurately measure
the service provided, and the city may further establish by resolution the
rates to be charged for such service as will properly pay the fair share of the
services provided such user.

§ 90.04 RABIES VACCINATION, QUARANTINE AND DISEASE CONTROL.
   (A)   Rabies vaccination. The owner or custodian of any dog or cat shall be
responsible for having the animal vaccinated for rabies by a licensed
veterinarian and for keeping immunization current. Vaccinations must begin when
the animal has reached the age of four months. Every owner or custodian must,
upon request of an animal control officer or police officer, produce proof of
such vaccination(s).
   (B)   Suspected rabies; quarantine procedures.
      (1)   Any owner or custodian of any animal which shows symptoms of
rabies, or which has bitten any person, shall surrender the animal for
impoundment and isolation (quarantine) to a licensed veterinarian for a period
of 14 days or shall securely confine the animal on his or her premises for said
period of time. The choice of place of quarantine shall be at the discretion of
the animal control officer or the Police Department. All costs of quarantine
shall be borne by the animal owner or custodian. If an owner or custodian
refuses to surrender or confine the animal, animal control officers are hereby
authorized to seize the animal and transport it to a licensed veterinarian.
Animal control officers or police officers are hereby authorized to immediately
impound any quarantined animal found outside the quarantine area and arrange
for its confinement in accordance with this section.
      (2)   If the animal has been confined by its owner or custodian, on the
next working day following the 14-day quarantine, the owner or custodian shall
take the animal to a licensed veterinarian for examination and to be examined
and to obtain a rabies vaccination if the owner has not provided a current
valid rabies vaccination certificate to the Police Department. A copy of the
examination results and a current certificate of rabies vaccination must be
provided to the Police Department no later than the following day.
      (3)   Failure of the owner to comply with any of these provisions shall
result in the immediate impoundment of the animal, and it shall be subject to
disposition in accordance with the policies of this chapter. If an animal
quarantined is determined to be free of rabies, it shall be returned to the
owner or custodian upon payment of all costs of confinement, examination and
vaccination. If such charges are not paid, the animal shall not be returned and
shall be subject to disposition in accordance with the policies and procedures
of this chapter.
   (C)   Premature destruction; preservation of the head. It is unlawful for
any person to kill or have killed any animal suspected of being rabid;
provided, however, that an animal control officer or other law enforcement
officers may kill any such animal if he or she determines that the animal is so
vicious or wild that it cannot be restrained and impounded or that further
pursuit would result in losing the animal, and if the animal can be killed so
as not to damage the head. The head of any animal so killed must be severed
from the body and sent to the Public Health Department for examination and
diagnosis immediately as time is of critical importance due to the degradation
of the tissue.
   (D)   Control of contagious disease. It is unlawful for any person to
knowingly permit or allow any animal with a contagious or infectious disease
upon the public streets, roads and way of this city; or to be within any public
transportation facility or other public building or place; or to expose such
animal in a public building or place whereby the health and safety of any
person may be affected.

impound that animal and shall immediately notify the Sheriff’s dispatch
personnel that he or she is holding the animal in his or her own possession and
provide a description of the animal and the name of the animal owner, if known.
The dispatch should notify a police officer or an animal control officer to
impound the animal at the first reasonable opportunity to do so.
      (2)   If the name of the owner or custodian is known or can be easily
obtained, the officer may return the animal to the residential address of the
owner. If there is no one present, the officer may impound the animal and shall
leave written notice at the residence of the person or place to contact to
reclaim the animal. The animal control officer shall then attempt to make
arrangements for the dog’s confinement.
   (F)   Impoundment by officers. In addition to any other remedies provided in

impound and confine any of the following animals:
      (1)   Any dog without a valid license tag;
      (2)   Any animal at large;
      (3)   Any animal that is in violation of any quarantine or confinement
order;

care. Upon determination by any police officer or veterinarian that the injury
or illness is untreatable, the animal may be euthanized by the officer or
veterinarian without regard to the waiting period set out in §
90.05. Costs of medical care or euthanasia shall be borne by the owner or

      (1)   The Commission may recommend to the Council a variance from the
provisions of this chapter on a finding that undue hardship may result from
strict compliance with specific provisions or requirements of this chapter or
that application of such provisions or requirements is impracticable. The
Commission shall only recommend variances that it deems necessary to, or
desirable for, the public interest. In making its findings, the Commission
shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity.
      (2)   No variance shall be recommended unless the Commission finds after
a public hearing that:
         (a)   1.   There are such special circumstances or conditions
affecting said property that the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter would clearly be impracticable or unreasonable.
            2.   In such cases, the subdivider shall first state his or her
reasons in writing as to the specific provisions or requirement involved;
         (b)   The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated;
         (c)   Such variance will not violate the provisions of the state code;
and
         (d)   Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the
interest and purpose of this chapter and the comprehensive development plan.
(Prior Code, § 16.32.010)
   (B)   Topographical-physical limitation variance. Where in the case of a
particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance with
the requirements of this chapter would result in extraordinary hardship to the
subdivider because of unusual topography, other physical conditions or other
such conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that these conditions would
result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the
Commission may recommend to the Council that variance modification or a waiver
of these requirements be granted.
(Prior Code, § 16.32.020)
   (C)   Planned unit development variance.
      (1)   The developer may request a variance from specified portions of
this chapter in the case of a planned unit development. Upon considering the
requested variance, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the
proposed use of the land and existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision, the probable effect
of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity, adequate
open space, light, air and other needs.
      (2)   The Commission’s findings and report to the Council shall include
whether:
         (a)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
community development and be in compliance with the comprehensive development
plan;
         (b)   The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas; and
         (c)   The proposed project will be served with adequate public
facilities.
(Prior Code, § 16.32.030)
(Ord. 462, passed 6-9-1975)
§ 152.010 ENFORCEMENT.
   No subdivision plat required by this chapter or the state code shall be
admitted to the public land records of the county or recorded by the County
Recorder until such subdivision plat has received final approval by the
Council. No public board, agency, Commission, official or other authority shall
proceed with the construction of or authorize the construction of any of the
public improvements required by this chapter until the final plat has received
the approval by the Council.

property or which may increase or create a flood hazard. Such land within a
subdivision shall be set aside for other uses such as parks or other open
space.
   (F)   Backup lots. Lots shall back into such features as freeways, arterial
streets, shopping centers or industrial properties, except where there is a
marginal access street, unless a secondary access is provided. Such lots shall
contain a landscaped easement along the rear at least 20 feet wide in addition
to the utility easement; the restricted access to the arterial street will
minimize noise and protect outdoor living areas. Lots extending through a block
and having frontage on two local streets shall be prohibited.
   (G)   Lot frontage. All rectangular lots shall have at least 75 feet of
frontage upon a publicly dedicated street. Variances may be permitted for an
approved planned unit development.
   (H)   Future arrangements.
      (1)   Where parcels of land are subdivided into unusually large lots
(such as when large lots are approved for septic tank operations) the parcels
shall be divided, where feasible, so as to allow for future re-subdividing into
smaller parcels. Lot arrangements shall allow for the ultimate extension of

   (A)   Flood areas. For any proposed subdivision that is located within a
floodplain, the developer shall provide the Commission with a development plan
of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will show and explain at
least the following:
      (1)   Location of all planned improvements;
      (2)   The location of the floodway and the floodway fringe per
engineering practices as specified by the Army Corps of Engineers;
      (3)   The location of the present water channel;
      (4)   Any planned rerouting of waterways;
      (5)   All major drainageways;
      (6)   Areas of frequent flooding;
      (7)   Means of floodproofing buildings; and
      (8)   Means of insuring loans for improvements within the floodplain.
   (B)   Justification for development. Upon the determination that buildings
are planned with the floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated
within the floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer
shall through design demonstrate conclusively to the Commission that such
development will not present a hazard to life or limb, hazard to property,
adverse effects on the safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage
channel and not have an adverse impact on the natural environment.
   (C)   Commission’s findings.
      (1)   In determining the appropriateness of subdivision for land located
within a floodplain, the Commission shall consider the objectives of this
subchapter and at least the following:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to the increased flood
heights or velocities caused by subdivision fill, roads and intended uses;
         (b)   The danger that intended uses may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
         (c)   The adequacy of proposed water supply and sanitation systems and
the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions under flood conditions;
         (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (e)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (f)   The requirements of the subdivision for a waterfront location;
         (g)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed subdivision and land use;
         (h)   The compatibility of the proposed uses with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
         (i)   The relationship of the proposed subdivision to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area;
         (j)   The safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles in
times of flood;
         (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
         (l)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If only
part of a proposed subdivision can be safely developed, the Council shall limit
development to that part and shall require the development proceed consistent
with that determination.
   (D)   Floodproofing plans. Floodproofing plans must be individually approved
by the Council upon recommendation from the Commission before such uses are
constructed. Floodproofing may include but is not limited to the following:
      (1)   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement;
      (2)   Installation of watertight doors, bulk-heads and shutters or
similar methods of closure;
      (3)   Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures;
      (4)   Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls;
      (5)   Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation;
      (6)   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures;
      (7)   Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems so as to
prevent the entrance of floodwaters;
      (8)   Installation of pumps or comparable facilities for subsurface
drainage systems to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood
pressures;
      (9)   Building design and construction to resist rupture or collapse
caused by water pressure or floating debris;
      (10)   Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains
which permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and
stormwaters into buildings or structures;
      (11)   Location and installation of all electrical equipment, circuits
and electrical appliances so that they are protected from inundation by the
regulatory flood; and
      (12)   Location of storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant
materials, flammable liquids or other toxic materials which could be hazardous
to public health, safety and welfare at elevations above the height associated
with the regulatory protection elevation or design of such facilities to
prevent flotation of storage containers, or damage to storage containers which
could result in the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters.

§ 153.023 CITY IMPACT AREA.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of establishing as area of city impact is to
identify a logical urban fringe area adjoining the city. The urban fringe area
is realizing development pressure that must be planned for in an orderly
manner. Idaho Code § 67-6526 requires cities and counties negotiate an area of
city impact.
(Prior Code, § 17.32.010)
   (B)   Consideration. The following factors were considered by the Planning
Commission and the Council in the establishment of an area of city impact:
      (1)   Trade area;
      (2)   Geographic factors; and
      (3)   Areas that can reasonably be expected to be annexed in the future.
(Prior Code, § 17.32.020)
   (C)   Geographic area. The officially adopted geographic area of city impact
is shown on the map in the ordinance codified in this chapter entitled, “Area
of City Impact for the City of Montpelier.”
(Prior Code, § 17.32.030)
   (D)   Applications. The city’s comprehensive plan, zoning and subdivision
ordinances and respective, subsequent amendments as officially adopted by the
city and the county shall apply to the area of city impact within the
unincorporated area of the county. The city and the county will review the
impact agreement annually.
(Prior Code, § 17.32.040)

may be kept under the following conditions.
      (1)   The property must have a minimum of 10,000 square feet. The square
footage shall not include any combination of the following: The footprint of
the house, the front yard and five feet of the side yards contiguous to the
house.
      (2)   Animals may be kept at a minimum ratio of not more than one animal
unit per 10,000 square feet of land and shall have access to that 10,000 square
feet of land.
      (3)   The following shall be considered one animal unit:
         (a)   One horse (donkey, mule);
         (b)   One cow;
         (c)   Three sheep;
         (d)   Twenty-six chickens (must be caged or confined and are not
required to have access to the 10,000 square feet of land);
         (e)   Twenty-six rabbits (must be caged or confined and are not
required to have access to the 10,000 square feet of land); and
         (f)   Twenty-five pigeons (must be caged or confined and are not
required to have access to the 10,000 square feet of land).
      (4)   Animals not specifically named in divisions (B)(3)(a) through (B)
(3)(f) above shall not be permitted.
      (5)   Any animal not specifically identified in this section is permitted
by conditional use only.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.020)
   (C)   Animal-free areas. Animal-free areas shall be those areas within the
city limits not allowing the keeping of any large animal units.
(Prior Code, § 17.36.030)
   (D)   Performance standards.
      (1)   Owners or managers of any large animal unit(s) shall maintain a
fence adequate to prevent animals from harming neighbors’ property, including
tree and bush foliage within the neighbors’ property but not including
overgrowth.
      (2)   Owners or managers of large animal units shall have a continuous
obligation to maintain adequate housekeeping practices to prevent the creation
of a nuisance.
      (3)   If the property does not meet the size requirements to house large
animal units, large animal units may not be maintained upon the sale of the
property.

(Prior Code, § 17.40.010)
§ 153.036 SUPPLEMENTAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to all yard regulations specified in the official schedule of
district regulations and in other sections of this chapter, the following
provisions shall be adhered to.
   (A)   Accessory buildings, detached.
      (1)   Accessory buildings, including portable car shelters, shall not be
located in any required front yard, shall be located ten feet from the

division (C) below.)
   (C)   Front yard projections; porches.
      (1)   Covered but unenclosed porches, when not more than one story high
and which do not extend more than six feet beyond the front walls of the
building (but in no case shall such projection come closer than ten feet from
the setback line), are exempt from the front yard setback provisions and need
not be included in determining front yard setback when requesting the addition
of a porch to an existing home.
      (2)   As of this subchapter date, such described porches shall not be
subject to a conditional use permit, but the owner shall be required to come
before the Planning and Zoning Commission with plans and setback measurements.
New structures will be subject to the architectural projections requirement
above.
   (D)   Front yard restrictions. In any required front yard, no fence or wall

   (F)   Side and rear yard requirements for nonresidential uses abutting
residential districts.
      (1)   Nonresidential buildings or uses shall not be located nor conducted
closer than 30 feet to any lot line of a residential district, except that the
minimum yard requirements may be reduced to 50% of the requirement if
acceptable landscaping or screening approved by the Commission is provided.
      (2)   Such screening shall be a masonry or solid fence between four and
eight feet in height, maintained in good condition and free of all advertising
or other signs.
      (3)   Landscaping provided in lieu of such wall or fence shall consist of
a strip of land not less than 15 feet in width planted with an evergreen hedge
or dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than four feet in height at the
time of planting.
   (G)   Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any district nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of three and ten feet above the
centerline grades of the intersecting streets of such corner lots and a line
joining points along said street lines 50 feet from the point of centerline
intersection.
(Prior Code, § 17.40.020)
§ 153.037 SUPPLEMENTAL GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   In addition to all other regulations as specified in this chapter, the
following provisions shall be adhered to.
   (A)   Parking and storage of certain vehicles. Automotive vehicles or
trailers of any kind or type without current license plates shall not be parked

consecutive days. Further, such vehicles and trailers are not allowed to park
within the city right-of-way, except for loading and unloading, which shall be
limited to a maximum of 72 hours.
   (B)   Storage of chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers and the like. Any
storage of chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum products or any
similar products (excepting for household use), regardless of zone, are subject
to the city’s wellhead protection plan and are prohibited in rental storage
units. Such storage, handling, manufacturing and disposal shall require
approval by the Fire Chief and must have adequate fire protection.
   (C)   Temporary buildings in conjunction with construction. Construction
site buildings to be used on a temporary basis may be permitted during the
period construction is in progress, but such facilities must be removed upon

requirements for their zoned area.
(Prior Code, § 17.40.030)
§ 153.038 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES.
   (A)   New commercial buildings will require approval from the Fire
Department.
   (B)   No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any
manner creating dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable
conditions which could adversely affect the surrounding areas or adjoining
premises, except that any use permitted by this chapter may be undertaken and
maintained if acceptable measures and safeguards to reduce dangerous and
objectionable conditions to acceptable limits are established by adhering to
the following performance requirements.
      (1)   Air pollution. Air pollution shall be subject to the requirements
and regulations established by the health authority.
      (2)   Enforcement provisions. The Administrator, prior to the issuance of
a building permit, may require the submission of statements and plans
indicating the manner in which dangerous and objectionable elements involved in
processing and in equipment operations are to be eliminated or reduced to
acceptable limits and tolerances.
      (3)   Erosion. No erosion by human, wind or water which will carry
objectionable substances onto neighboring properties shall be permitted.
      (4)   Fire hazards.
         (a)   Any activity involving the use or storage or sale or
manufacturing of noxious, flammable or explosive materials, including, but not
limited to, chemicals, pesticides, petroleum products or fertilizers, shall be
protected by adequate firefighting and fire prevention equipment and by such
safety devices as are normally used in the handling of any such material.
         (b)   Such hazards shall be kept removed from adjacent activities to a
distance which is compatible with the potential danger involved, as specified
in the International Fire Code and the National Safety Foundation, and not less
than 300 feet from a residential zone, a residence, except for an owner’s
residence, a motel or hotel, and shall comply with the following:
         (a)   Will be erected subject to the approval of the Fire Chief;
         (b)   Will have suitable loading and unloading spaces and off-street
parking facilities subject to the approval of the Fire Chief; and

      (6)   Measurement procedures. Methods and procedures for the
determination of the existence of any dangerous and objectionable elements
shall conform to the standards set by the Department of Environmental Quality
(DEQ).
      (7)   Noise. Objectionable noise, as determined by the Administrator,
which is due to volume, frequency or beat shall be muffled or otherwise
controlled. Air raid sirens and related apparatus used solely for public
purposes are exempt from this requirement.
      (8)   Radioactivity or electrical disturbance. No activity shall emit
harmful radioactivity at any point or electrical disturbance adversely
affecting the operation of any equipment at any point other than that of the
creator of such disturbance.
      (9)   Twenty-four-hour businesses. Businesses operating for 24 hours must
provide buffers such as evergreen trees or walls sufficient to address noise
and light abatement if they abut residential areas.
      (10)   Vibration. No vibration shall be permitted which is discernible
without instruments on any adjoining lot or property.

(Prior Code, § 17.64.010)
§ 153.161 ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals to the Commission concerning interpretation or administration
of this chapter may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer or
bureau of the legislative authority affected by any decision of the
Administrator.
   (B)   Such appeal shall be taken within 15 days after the decision of the
Administrator by filing with the Administrator and with the Commission a notice
of appeal specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is taken. The
Administrator shall transmit to the Commission all the papers constituting the
record upon which the appeal is based.
(Prior Code, § 17.64.020)
§ 153.162 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action taken unless
the Administrator certifies to the Commission, after the notice of appeal is
filed with him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the application, a
stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.
In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining
order, which may be granted by the Commission or by a court based upon an
application, with notice to the Administrator showing due cause.
(Prior Code, § 17.64.030)
§ 153.163 VARIANCES.
   The Commission may recommend in specific cases such variance from the terms
of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring
lands, structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be
granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary
hardship. A variance shall not be considered a right or special privilege, but
may be granted to an applicant only upon a showing of undue hardship because of
characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict with the
public interest.
(Prior Code, § 17.64.040)

conforms to the following standards.
         (a)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
         (b)   A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter.
         (c)   Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures
or buildings in the same district.
   (B)   A variance shall not be recommended unless the Commission makes
specific findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented
to it which support conclusions that the above mentioned standards and
conditions have been met by the applicant.
(Prior Code, § 17.64.050)
§ 153.165 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   (A)   Under no circumstances shall the Commission recommend an appeal or
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this chapter in said district.
   (B)   In recommending any appeal or variance, the Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. A
violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter.

      (2)   The reasons, facts and findings for approval or denial; and
      (3)   The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a
permit.
(Prior Code, § 17.64.080)
§ 153.168 NOTIFICATION TO APPLICANT.

provide the applicant with written notice of the recommendation on the request.
