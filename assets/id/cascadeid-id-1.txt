placed in or upon private property and shall be securely built, constructed and
erected in conformance with the requirements of the Uniform Sign Code.
      2.   Materials: Materials of construction for signs and sign structures
shall be of the quality and grade as specified for buildings in the Uniform
Building Code.
      3.   Restrictions On Combustible Materials: Ground signs may be
constructed of any material meeting the requirements of the Uniform Sign Code.
No combustible materials other than approved plastics shall be used in the
construction of electric signs.
      4.   Anchorage: Anchorage of signs or sign structures will be as

set forth in the Uniform Sign Code.
   (C)   Projection And Clearance:
      1.   General: Signs shall conform to the clearance and projection
requirements of the Uniform Sign Code.
   (D)   Computations: The following principles shall control the computation
of sign area and sign height:
      1.   Computation Of Area Of Individual Signs: The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets Zoning Ordinance
regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
      2.   Computation Of Area Of Multifaced Signs: The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from any one point. When two (2) identical sign faces are
placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the
same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are
not more than forty two inches (42") apart, the sign area shall be computed by
the measurement of one of the faces.
      3.   Computation Of Height: The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of:
         (a)   Existing grade prior to construction, or
         (b)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign, or

or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outdoors. Lights that are
indoors that are intended to light something outside are considered exterior
lighting for the purpose of this chapter. Exterior lighting does not include
emergency or warning lights on vehicles.
FULLY SHIELDED: Lighting which incorporates a solid barrier (the shield), which
permits no light to escape through the barrier. See section
2-4-6, figure 2 of this chapter.
GLARE: Stray, unshielded light striking the eye that may result in:
   (A)   Nuisance or annoyance glare such as light shining into a window;
   (B)   Discomfort glare such as bright light causing squinting of the eyes;
   (C)   Disabling glare such as bright light reducing the ability of the eyes
to see into shadows; or
   (D)   Reduction of visual performance.
KELVIN: Temperature scale, in this context, is used to describe the perceived
color or appearance of light ranging from cool (blue) to warm (yellow) measured
in kelvins (K). See section

granted.
      1.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, approval of the Airport Manager shall not be required for any
tree or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above
the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits
prescribed for such zones.
      2.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zone, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet (4,200')
from each end of the runway, approval of the Airport Manager shall not be
required for any tree or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zone.
      3.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, approval of the Airport Manager shall not
be required for any tree or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because
of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
      4.   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this Chapter except as set forth in Section

CHAPTER 5
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS
SECTION:
3-5-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose And Objectives
3-5-2: Definitions
3-5-3: General Provisions
3-5-4: Administration
3-5-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
3-5-6: Legal Status Provisions
3-5-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
   (A)   Statutory Authority: The State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code
sections 46-1020, 46-1023 and 46-1024 authorizes local governments to adopt
floodplain management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum
floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human
life, health, and property.
   (B)   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Cascade are subject to
periodic inundation that results in:
         (a)   Loss of life and property;
         (b)   Health and safety hazards;
         (c)   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
         (d)   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and
protection; and
         (e)   Impairment to the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      3.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management.
   (C)   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life, health, and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      7.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (D)   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to
accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
      1.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store flood waters. (Ord. 696, 1-
28-2019, eff. 2-1-2019)
3-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE): A structure on the same lot or
parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
ADDITION (To An Existing Building): An extension or increase in the floor area
or height of a building or structure.
APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator interpretation of
provisions of this chapter.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: See definition of structure.
CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities or
critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical datum
currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for measuring heights is
the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings, manufacturer homes, tiny houses or
other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial
improvements to existing structures; bulkheads, retaining walls, piers, and
pools; the placement of mobile homes; or the deposition or extraction of
materials; the construction or elevation of dikes, berms and levees.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM): The digital official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The Elevation Certificate is an important administrative
tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood insurance premium
rate; it is used to document elevation information and it may be used to
support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map
Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area formed
when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/RFPE is not considered an enclosure.
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings,
structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the
flow capacity of a floodplain.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park or subdivision where the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the original floodplain management regulations
adopted by the community, August 13, 1976.
EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the
Federal Insurance Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been
designated as Zones A, M, and/or E.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): An examination, evaluation, and determination of
flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations; or
an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or

normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
as defined in subsection (A)2 of this definition and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when
earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   (B)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection (A)1 of this definition.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the freeboard.
   (A)   In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations (BFEs)
have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet (2') of
freeboard; and
   (B)   In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established,
this elevation shall be at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent
grade.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of flooding
in the area, and applicable insurance rate.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation
(BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE).
Freeboard shall be two feet (2').
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for HAG related to building elevation
information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   (A)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
   (B)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district;
   (C)   Individually listed on a State Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
   (D)   Individually listed on a Local Inventory of Historic Places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1.   By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      2.   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter.
They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and
Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to
whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the
minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of
special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon submission and
approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building permits and/or
flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR, because a CLOMR
does not change the NFIP map.
Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
ground above the base flood elevation.
Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of
physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a
flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory
floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood
hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and when
appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally
accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM or FIS
report.
Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The
LOMR-F does not change the FIRM or FIS report.
LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to building
elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this
chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of any
accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as
North America Vertical Datum of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations
(BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow,
or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program
of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide
control works, and floodplain management regulations.
MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program created
by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
Any construction started after August 13, 1976 is subject to the ordinance in
effect at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of construction
was within one hundred eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before September 15, 1989 the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   (A)   Built on a single chassis, and
   (B)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and
   (C)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   (D)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into compliance
with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not
possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: An NFIP-insured structure that has had at least two
(2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in any
10-year period since 1978.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Also see
definition of structure in section
3-1-4 of this title.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred. See
definition of "substantial improvement". Substantial damage also means flood-
related damage sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   (A)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (B)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
chapter.
TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS: FEMA publications that provide
guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are
contained in title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations section 60.3. The
bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and local
officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by
members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact sheets provide
guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the State or local Building Code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse
includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur. (Ord. 696, 1-28-2019, eff. 2-1-2019)
3-5-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (A)   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City. Nothing in this
chapter is intended to allow uses or structures that are otherwise prohibited
by the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Basis For Special Flood Hazard Areas: The special flood hazard areas
identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator in a scientific and
engineering report titled "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Valley County and
Incorporated Areas" dated February 1, 2019, with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM) or Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM), and other
supporting data, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter.
The FIS and the FIRM are on file at Cascade City Hall, 105 South Main Street,
Cascade, Idaho.
   (C)   Establishment Of Floodplain Development Permit: A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities within special
flood hazard areas determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection
3-5-4(B) of this chapter.
   (D)   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter shall not in any way
repeal, abrogate, impair, or remove the necessity of compliance with any other
laws, ordinances, regulations, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions,
etcetera. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes more stringent or greater restrictions shall control.
   (F)   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
   (G)   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City, or by any officer
or employee thereof for flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter
or an administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (H)   Penalties For Noncompliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted, or altered unless in full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the
provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements,
including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) or imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days, or
both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from
taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 696, 1-28-2019, eff. 2-1-2019)
3-5-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   (A)   Designation Of Floodplain Ordinance Administrator: The City of Cascade
building inspector, is hereby designated as the "Floodplain Administrator",
with the responsibility to administer and implement the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: The
Floodplain Administrator shall perform, but not be limited to, the following
duties:
      1.   Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits for
all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to
assure that all necessary local, State, and Federal permits have been received,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 USC 1334.
      3.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA).
      4.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      5.   Prevent encroachments into floodways unless the certification and
flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection
3-5-5(E) of this chapter are met.
      6.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new
and substantially improved structures in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (C)3 of this section.
      7.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
to which all new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been
floodproofed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (C)3 of this
section.
      8.   Review plans to verify public utilities are constructed in
accordance with the provisions of subsections
3-5-5(A)5 - (A)7 of this chapter.
      9.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
and maintain certifications from a registered professional engineer or
architect in accordance with the provisions of subsection (C)3 of this section
and subsection
3-5-5(B)2 of this chapter.
      10.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas and floodways (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this chapter.
      11.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided, in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
3-5-3(B) of this chapter, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data,
along with floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source,
including data developed pursuant to subsection
3-5-5(C)2 of this chapter, in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
      12.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided, in accordance with the provisions of subsection
3-5-3(B) of this chapter, require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A1-30 or AE on the community's FIRM, unless it demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point in the community.
      13.   When the lowest floor and the lowest adjacent grade of a structure
or the lowest ground elevation of a parcel in a special flood hazard area
(SFHA) is above the base flood elevation (BFE), advise the property owner of
the option to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA. Maintain a
copy of the LOMA issued by FEMA in the floodplain development permit file.
      14.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      15.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the Floodplain Administrator
shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that
the work is being done according to the provisions of this chapter and the
terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has
a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises
within the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      16.   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order constitutes a misdemeanor.
      17.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The Floodplain
Administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of State or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable State or local law may
also be revoked.
      18.   Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his or her Inspections Department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      19.   Follow through with corrective procedures of subsection (D) of this
section.
      20.   Review, provide input, and make recommendations for variance
requests.
      21.   Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to,
the FIS report, FIRM and other official flood maps, and studies, adopted in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
3-5-3(B) of this chapter, including any revisions thereto including Letters of
Map Change, issued by FEMA. Notify the NFIP State Coordinator and FEMA of your
community's mapping needs.
      22.   Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including Letters of
Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-Fs) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs).
      23.   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA) of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a
submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes
affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management
requirements will be based upon current data.
      24.   Upon occurrence, notify the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA)
in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that all FHBM's and FIRM's accurately represent the community's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the community
suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new
area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.

the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor
more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. Where the Floodplain
Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he
or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may
be feasible.
      4.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective
action may appeal the order to the local elected Governing Body by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk
within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of
an appeal, the order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local
Governing Body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm,
modify and affirm, or revoke the order.
      5.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the Governing Body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished at the
discretion of the court.
   (E)   Variance Procedures:
      1.   Requests For Variances: The Cascade City Council, shall hear and
decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Issuance: Variances may be issued for:

      4.   Written Report: The applicant shall include a written report
addressing each of the above factors in subsections (E)3(a) through (E)3(k) of
this section, with their application for a variance.
      5.   Conditions: Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this chapter, Council may attach such conditions as it deems
necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
      6.   Notification: Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation
(BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such
construction below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00)
per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification
shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance.
      7.   Maintenance: The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records
of all actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the State of Idaho upon request.

3-5-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   (A)   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
provisions are required:
      1.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage in accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, "Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements", and available from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      3.   All new construction, substantial improvements, and development
shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      4.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      6.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      7.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      8.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, which is below the lowest floor and used solely for
parking, access, and storage shall:
         (a)   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         (b)   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (2)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (3)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and

            (5)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
            (6)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or flood resistant wood underpinning, regardless of
structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as
outlined above.
      9.   Any alteration, repair or reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and is
of substantial improvement, shall meet the requirements of "new construction"
as contained in this chapter.
      10.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction,
or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of
this chapter and located totally or partially within the floodway, or stream
setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the flood
protection elevation in the floodway, or stream setback, and provided that such

approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
      16.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
      17.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
      18.   If fill is placed in a floodway, a no rise certification is
required. Fill is not allowed to displace the water onto neighboring properties
and must meet requirements of the Letters of Map Revision Based On Fill as
approved by FEMA.
   (B)   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in section

Home Installation Standard" in accordance with Idaho Code section 44-2201(2).
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty six inches (36") or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty six inches (36") in height, an engineering
certification is required.
         (c)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of subsection (B)4 of this section.
         (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
      4.   Additions/Improvements:
         (a)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         (b)   Additions to non-compliant post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications to the existing structure other
than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to
comply with the standards for new construction.
         (c)   Additions and/or improvements to non-compliant post-FIRM
structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any
interior modifications to the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         (d)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten
(10) year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building
or structure, the ten (10) year period begins on the date of the first
improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective
date of this chapter. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
            (1)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
            (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.

subsection (A) of this section shall apply:
The BFE used in determining the flood protection elevation (FPE) shall be
determined based on the following criteria:
      1.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in subsections (A) and
(B) of this section.
      2.   When floodway data is available from a Federal, State, or other
source, all new construction and substantial improvements within the floodway
shall also comply with the requirements of subsections (B) and (E) of this
section.
      3.   All subdivision, manufactured home park, and other development
proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home
sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in
accordance with subsection
3-5-3(B) of this chapter and utilized in implementing this chapter. The
applicant/developer shall submit application for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR) prior to Preliminary Plat approval and have obtained a Letter
of Map Revision (LOMR) prior to any building permits for structures being
issued. See FEMA 480 and/or FEMA 265 for further information.
      4.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a
Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the lowest floor shall be
elevated or floodproofed (non-residential) to two feet (2') above the highest
adjacent grade (HAG) at the building site or to the flood protection elevation
(FPE) whichever is higher, as defined in section
3-5-2 of this chapter. All other applicable provisions of subsection (B) of
this section shall also apply.
   (D)   Standards For Riverine Floodplains With Base Flood Elevations But
Without Established Floodways: Along rivers and streams where base flood
elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source
but floodway areas are not identified for a special flood hazard area on the
FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all
development within such areas:
      1.   Standards of subsections (A) and (B) of this section, and
      2.   Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical
data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood at any point within the community.
   (E)   Standards For Floodways: Areas designated as floodways are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
3-5-3(B) of this chapter. The floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to
the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in subsections (A) and (B) of this section shall apply to all
development within such areas:
      1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator
prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or
         (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6)
months of completion of the proposed encroachment.
      2.   If subsection (E)1 of this section is satisfied, all development
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
chapter.
      3.   Manufactured homes may be permitted provided the following
provisions are met:
         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (B)3 of
this section; and
         (b)   The encroachment standards of subsection (E)1 of this section.
   (F)   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (Zone AO, AH, AR/AO, Or AR/
AH): Areas designated as shallow flooding areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one foot (1') to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition, to subsections (A) and (B) of
this section, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four
feet (4') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection (F)1 of this section,
so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required in accordance with subsection
3-5-4(C)3 of this chapter and subsection (B)2 of this section.
      3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.

in planning and land use decision making.

TAXPAYER: Any person subject to or liable for any taxes imposed by this chapter. (Ord. 711, 6-7-
          2021)
 
4-8-2: IMPOSITION AND RATE OF CERTAIN NON-PROPERTY TAXES, TO WIT: A ONE PERCENT
(1%) SALES TAX ON THE SALES PRICE OF ALL PROPERTY SUBJECT TO TAXATION:
The City of Cascade, hereby imposes and shall collect certain local-option non-
property taxes, as follows:
   A.   A municipal sales tax is hereby imposed upon each sale at retail within
the City of Cascade, Idaho, at the rate of one percent (1%) of the sales price
of all property subject to taxation under Idaho Code 63 3601, et. seq., Idaho
Sales Tax Act, including subsequent amendments thereto;
   B.   When the sales price involves a fraction of a dollar, said local-option
non-property taxes shall be collected on that fractional portion of the price
by adding thereto the tax based upon a bracket system. The bracket system for
the collection of the one percent (1%) sales tax shall be as set forth in
Exhibit 1, attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. The retailer
shall calculate the tax upon the entire amount of purchases of the consumer
made at a particular time subject to this chapter, and not separately upon each
item purchased. The retailer may retain any amount collected under said bracket
system which is in excess of the amount of tax for which they are liable to the
City during the period as compensation for the work of collecting said tax.
   C.   All monies collected and/or retained under the provisions of this
chapter shall be held in trust for the City of Cascade and for payment thereof
to the City Clerk in the manner and at the times provided in this Chapter.
   D.   This chapter, in conjunction with Idaho State Law, provides that when
there is a retail sales transaction within the City of Cascade, a local-option
sales tax is imposed. For a sale of goods, a sale is made in the City when
title passes to the buyer in the City. When delivery of goods occurs in the
City of Cascade title passes at the time of delivery. If goods are shipped from
outside the City of Cascade into the City, the Seller must obtain a City of
Cascade local-option non-property tax permit pursuant to the terms of 4-8-7,
and the sale is subject to the local-option sales tax. Alternatively, when
goods are delivered by a seller within the City of Cascade to a location
outside the City, then title generally passes outside the City, and no sales
tax is owed to the City. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-3: DURATION OF TAXES:
The non-property taxes authorized and collected under this chapter are hereby
imposed for a duration of five (5) years from the effective date of this
chapter. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-4: PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM SAID NON-PROPERTY TAXES
SHALL BE USED:
The local-option non-property tax revenue derived from and collected under this
chapter shall be used only for the following purposes:
   A.    Public streets, sidewalks, pedestrian crosswalks, pathways, and other
public rights-of-way which will help improve public health and safety.
   B.   Public parks maintenance, development, and beautification. (Ord. 711,
6-7-2021)
4-8-5: AUTHORIZATION FOR CITY CLERK TO ADMINISTER, REGULATE AND COLLECT SAID
NON-PROPERTY TAXES:
The City Clerk of the City of Cascade is hereby authorized and empowered to
administer, regulate and collect payment of all non-property taxes adopted and
imposed by this chapter. Said Clerk shall have all of the powers set forth in
this chapter together with those additional powers necessary and proper to
carry out the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-6: CREATION OF A PROPERTY TAX RELIEF FUND:
Pursuant to Idaho Code § 50-1045, there is hereby created in the office of the
City Clerk a fund to be designated as the "Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund."
Any revenues collected under this Chapter in excess of the amount budgeted by
the City Council for the use of said revenues, shall be placed by the City
Clerk into the Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund. Such excess revenues shall
be used to replace City property taxes in the ensuing fiscal year by the amount
of all excess revenues placed in said Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund. (Ord.
711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-7: ESTABLISHMENT OF GENERAL AND ENTERPRISE FUND CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE
BUDGETS:
In addition to the revenue collected from the taxes imposed by this chapter,
the City Council will establish in each fiscal year's budget a specific line
item within the general fund, sewer fund, and water fund, apart and separate
from the revenuegenerated by this chapter, for the replacement, repair and
maintenance (where maintenance will extend the life of existing capital
infrastructure) of capital infrastructure. The intent of this provision is to
also use some of the City's existing revenue sources for repair, replacement
and maintenance of the capital infrastructure of the City. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-8: PERMITS REQUIRED AND ISSUANCE OF PERMITS:
   A.   Every person desiring to engage in or conduct business of retail sales,
and/or an occupancy rental, within this City shall file with the City Clerk an
application for a City of Cascade local-option non-property tax permit for each
place of business. A separate permit is required for each place of business
within the City. Every application for said permit shall be made upon a form
prescribed by the City Clerk and shall set forth the name under which the
applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of the
business or places of businesses, and such other information as the City may
require. The application shall be signed by the owner, if they are a natural
person; or in the case of an association or partnership, by a member or
partner, in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or other person
authorized by the corporation to sign the application.
   B.   Upon filing an application meeting the requirements set out above, the
City Clerk shall issue to each applicant a permit for each place of business. A
permit shall not be assignable, and shall be valid only for the person in whose
name it is issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated
therein. It shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the location for
which it was issued. Issuance of a permit may be subject to additional
requirements as set forth in this Chapter.
   C.   On the face of the permit shall be fixed a municipal non-property tax
number which shall be used by the applicant as an identifying number on all
filing, payment and correspondence with regard to the non-property tax imposed
under this Chapter. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-9: METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF TAXES:
   A.   The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be computed and paid for each
calendar month. Said taxes are due and payable to the City Clerk on or before
the 20th day of the succeeding month. The amount of tax paid shall be computed
on all sales subject to taxation under this chapter. Each person required to
hold a City of Cascade local-option non-property tax permit and number shall
file a City of Cascade local-option non-property tax return and a copy of their
Idaho State Sales Tax Return for the month at the same time said taxes are paid
to the City Clerk, unless said person has been permitted in writing by the
Idaho State Tax Commission to file quarterly sales or use tax returns. Persons
who have been permitted to file other than monthly returns shall notify the
City Clerk in writing and the City Clerk thereupon may require reporting of
State Tax Returns over some other period, but shall require payment of taxes on
a monthly basis.
   B.   A City of Cascade local-option non-property tax return shall be filed
each and every month by every person engaging in sales subject to taxation
under this Chapter regardless of whether or not any tax is due. Returns shall
be signed by the person required to file the return or by a duly authorized
agent.
   C.   A valid sales tax exemption certificate issued by the Idaho State Tax
Commission upon filing a copy thereof with the City Clerk shall have the same
effect to exempt the sale from the taxes imposed hereunder as in the Idaho
Sales Tax Act. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-10: AUDITS DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS:
   A.   The City Clerk may order an audit of any taxpayer under this chapter
for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness or completeness of any return
or payment.
   B.   If any error or omission is discovered in such audits or in any other
way, the City Clerk may compute and determine the amount of tax due upon the
basis of facts obtained from such information within its possession and assert
a deficiency. One (1) or more deficiency determinations may be made for the
amount due for one (1) or for more than one (1) period. In making such a
determination, the City Clerk may offset over payments against amounts due.
Further, said determinations shall be made for the period or periods in respect
to which the person fails to make a return and shall be based upon any
information which is in the City Clerk's possession.
   C.   The City Clerk shall give written notice of its determination and the
amount of its deficiency, including interest, at the rate of twelve percent
(12%) per annum from the date due, to the person from whom such deficiency
amount is due. Such notice may be given personally or mailed to the person at
the address furnished to the City Clerk in the non-property tax permit
application. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-11: RE-DETERMINATION OF DEFICIENCY:
   A.   Any person against whom a deficiency determination is made under this
chapter, or any person directly interested, may petition in writing for a re-
determination within thirty (30) days after service upon the person of notice
thereof. If the petition for re-determination is not filed within the thirty
(30) day period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the
period.
   B.   If a petition for re-determination is filed with the thirty (30) day
period the City Clerk shall reconsider the determination and, if the person so
requests in the petition, grant the person an oral hearing and give said person
ten (10) days notice of the time and place of the hearing personally or by mail
addressed to the person at the address furnished to the City Clerk in said
person's application for a non-property tax permit. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-12: APPEALS, INTEREST ON DEFICIENCY:
   A.   When a re-determination is made, the City Clerk shall give notice to
the taxpayer against whom the re-determination is made. Within thirty (30) days
of the date upon which such notice of re-determination is mailed or served, the
taxpayer may file an appeal with the City Council or may file a complaint with
the District Court for review of the City Clerk's re-determination. There shall
be no right of review to the City Council nor to the District Court on the
determination of taxes due made by the City Clerk unless a re-determination has
been timely filed. No assessment of a deficiency in respect to the tax imposed
by this Chapter or proceeding to collect for its collection shall be made,
begun or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer and
expiration of such thirty (30) day period after notice of re-determination, nor
if a protest is filed until a decision on the protest becomes final. If the
taxpayer does not protest to the City Council or file an action in District
Court within the time prescribed in this section, the deficiency shall be
assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and demand from the City
Clerk.
   B.   Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the
deficiency and shall become due and payable upon notice and demand from the
City Clerk and shall be collected as part of the tax at the rate of twelve
percent (12%) per annum from the date prescribed for payment of the tax. (Ord.
711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-13: COLLECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT:
As soon as practical after monthly City of Cascade local-option non-property
tax return and payment is filed, the City Clerk shall examine the same and
determine the correct amount of the tax. For the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any payment determining the amount of tax due where none has
been made, determining liability of any person for any tax payable under this
chapter, or the liability at law or in equity of any person in respect to any
tax provided by this chapter or collecting any such liability, the City Clerk,
or duly authorized deputy, is authorized (1) to examine the books, papers,
records, or other data which may be relevant or material to the inquiry; (2) to
summon the person liable for the tax or any officer, agent or employee of such
person, or any person having possession, custody or care of books of accounting
containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for the tax,
to appear before the City Clerk, or deputy, at a time and place named in its
summons to produce such books, papers, records or other data and/or give such
testimony under oath as may be relevant or material to such inquiry. (Ord. 711,
6-7-2021)
4-8-14: REFUNDS, LIMITATIONS AND INTEREST:
   A.   If the City Clerk determines that any amount due under this chapter has
been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
computed, the City Clerk shall set forth that fact in its records and the
excess amount paid or collected may be credited on any amount due or payable to
the City Clerk for non-property taxes from that person, and any balance
refunded to the person by whom it was paid or to his successors, administrators
or executors.
   B.   No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after one (1) year
from the time the payment was made unless before the expiration of such period
a claim therefore is filed by the taxpayer.
   C.   Interest shall be allowed on the amount of such credits or refunds at
the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date which such tax was
paid.
   D.   Appeal from the City Clerk's decision denying in part or in whole a
claim for refund shall be made in accordance with the laws of the State of
Idaho with regard to claims against municipalities. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)

chapter on behalf of a corporation, as an officer employee of the corporation,
or on behalf of a partnership, as a member employee of the partnership, or on
behalf of a limited liability company, as a member or manager of the limited
liability company, shall be personally liable for payment of such tax, plus
penalties and interest. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)
4-8-16: PERIOD OF LIMITATION UPON ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION:
   A.   The amount of taxes imposed under this chapter shall be assessed within
three (3) years of the time the return upon which the tax asserted to be due

time, such tax may be collected within a period of six (6) years after
assessment. The running of limitations provided by this section shall be
suspended for the period during which the City Clerk is prohibited from making
the assessment or from collecting or proceeding in Court due to a petition for
re-determination or an appeal therefrom, and for thirty (30) days hereafter.
   B.   In the case of taxes due during the lifetime of a decedent, the tax
shall be assessed, and any proceeding in court without assessment for the
collection of such tax shall be begun, within six (6) months after written
request therefor (filed after the return is made) by the executor,
administrator, or other fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent
unless the assessment is stayed by a petition for re-determination or any
appeal therefrom.
   C.   In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax,
or of a failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in
Court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time

constituting the fraud. (Ord. 711, 6-7-2021)

times the actual, determined, or estimated average monthly amount of tax

percent (5%) of the tax not paid, or a minimum of $10 (whichever is greater).
The City Clerk shall assess and collect said fee at the time any delinquent tax

8-6-4: USE OF BACK-FLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   (A)   Back-flow prevention devices shall be installed at the ties on the
premises or the materials used in connection with service connection or within
any premises where, in the judgment of the purveyor, the nature and extent of
activities, or the materials stored on the premises, would present an immediate
and dangerous hazard to health and/or be deleterious to the quality of the
water should a cross-connection occur; even though such cross-connection does
not exist at the time the back-flow prevention devices shall be installed under
circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with Idaho State Department of Health
Regulations and is acceptable to the purveyor.
      2.   Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross-connections exist.
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross-connections do not exist.
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being
established or reestablished.
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply or where a cross-connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process
waters and cooling waters.
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature in such a
way that if back-siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard might result.
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a back-flow prevention device is required to protect the
public water supply. A back-flow prevention device shall be installed at these

hazard which exists:
      1.   An air-gap separation or a reduced pressure principle back-flow
prevention device shall be installed where the public water supply may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard.
      2.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not
hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air-gap separation, or a
reduced pressure principle back-flow prevention device shall be installed.
   (C)   Back-flow prevention devices required by this Chapter shall be
installed at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are
not used, or at a location designated by the purveyor. The device shall be
located so as to be readily accessible for maintenance and testing, and
furthermore, where no part of the device will be submerged.
   (D)   Back-flow prevention devices required by this Chapter shall be
installed under the supervision of, and with the approval of the purveyor.
   (E)   Any protective device required by this Chapter shall be a model

pressure principle back-flow prevention device will be approved if it has
successfully passed performance tests of the University of Southern California
Engineering Center or other testing laboratories satisfactory to the State of
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and the Building Official. These devices
shall be furnished and installed by and at the expense of the customer.
   (F)   Back-flow prevention devices installed pursuant to this Chapter,
except atmospheric vacuum breakers, shall be inspected and tested annually, or

backflow prevention devices at the point from which the water for irrigation is
taken from the public water supply.
   (H)   Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance,
testing or inspection of back-flow prevention devices required by this Chapter
shall be grounds for the termination of water service to the premises, or, in
the alternative, the installation of a air-gap separation at the customer's
expense.
8-6-5: CROSS-CONNECTION INSPECTION:
   (A)   No water shall be delivered to any structure hereafter built within
the City or within areas served by City water until the same shall have been
inspected by the purveyor for possible cross-connections and been approved as
being free of same.
   (B)   Any construction for industrial or other purposes which is classified
as hazardous facilities pursuant to Section
8-6-4(A)7 of this Chapter, where it is reasonable to anticipate intermittent
cross-connections, or as determined by the Building Official shall be protected
by the installation of one or more backflow prevention devices at the point of
service from the public water supply or any other location designated by the
purveyor.
   (C)   Inspections shall be made periodically of all buildings, structures,
or improvements of any nature now receiving water through the City's system,
for the purpose of ascertaining whether cross-connections exist. Such
inspections shall be made by the purveyor.
8-6-6: INSTALLATION PERMITS:
If cross-connection control devices are found to be necessary, the owner of the
property served must apply to the purveyor for a specific installation permit.
8-6-7: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
In the event an improper cross-connection is not corrected within the time
limit set by the Building Official or in the event the purveyor is refused
access to any property for the purpose of determining whether or not cross-
connections exist; delivery of water to the property shall cease until the
deficiency is corrected to the purveyor's satisfaction. In addition, the
purveyor may effect the necessary repairs or modification at the expense of the
property owner and refuse delivery of water to the property until the cost
thereof shall have been paid.

addition of the sanitary sewer base rate and the sanitary sewer improvement
rate.

base rate is based on the size of the existing or requested new water meter.
This rate is determined by comparing the city's standard water meter orifice
area to the water user's requested water meter orifice area. This comparison
would yield an adjustment factor which is then multiplied by the previously
defined sanitary sewer base rate.

8-3-1 of this title is to be used when calculating the multiplier in this
section. (Ord. 653, 5-29-2012)

sanitary sewer hookup fee will be based on the constituents of the wastewater
stream. This hookup fee is determined by comparing the City's standard
wastewater constituents to the projected industrial user's wastewater
constituents. This comparison would yield a constituents adjustment factor
which is then multiplied by the previously defined sanitary sewer base hookup
fee. The hookup fees are calculated on a case by case basis.
   (E)   Commencement Of Fees: The sanitary sewer hookup fees set out above
will commence beginning April 14, 2008.

9-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
This title shall be known and may be cited as the Cascade Rural Fire Protection
District Development Impact Fee Ordinance. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-1-2: AUTHORITY:
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Cascade's ( the "City") general
police powers, its authority to enact ordinances, and its authority as provided
by the Idaho Development Impact Fee Act codified at Chapter 82 of Title 67,
Idaho Code (the "Act") and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho to
impose development impact fees; and the City's and the Cascade Rural Fire
Protection District's authority to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement as
provided for in I.C.§ 67-8204A to impose, collect and expend development impact
fees. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-1-3: APPLICABILITY:
Except as otherwise exempted in section
9-5-1, these provisions shall apply to the development of property located
within the boundaries of the City of Cascade, Idaho. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-1-4: FINDINGS:
   A.   Cascade Rural Fire Protection District ("the District") is a taxing
District organized and existing by virtue of Chapter 14 of Title 31, Idaho
Code, and the District's boundaries include all areas within the City limits of
the City and areas surrounding the City; and
   B.   The District's duty and responsibility is to provide protection of
property against fire and the preservation of life, and enforcement of any of
the fire codes and other rules that are adopted by the state fire marshal; and
provide for the protection and preservation of life; and
   C.   The City is experiencing considerable growth and Development; and
   D.   The purposes of the Act [I.C.§ 67-8202] are as follows:
      1.   Ensure that adequate Public Facilities are available to serve new
growth and Development; and
      2.   Promote orderly growth and Development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments, such as the City and the District, may
require those who benefit from new growth and Development pay [development
impact fees] their Proportionate Share of the costs of new Public Facilities
needed to serve that new growth and Development; and
      3.   Establish minimum standards for adoption of development impact fee
ordinances by cities; and
      4.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and Development are
required to pay no more than their Proportionate Share of the cost of Public
Facilities needed to serve that new growth and Development and to prevent
duplicate and ad hoc Development Requirements; and
      5.   To empower cities to adopt ordinances to impose development impact
fees; and
   E.   The Act does not authorize the District to enact a development impact
fee ordinance; and
   F.   The Act does provide, pursuant to I.C.§ 67-8204A, in circumstances
where the City and the District are both affected by the considerable growth
and Development as is occurring within the City, that the City and the District
may enter into the Intergovernmental Agreement for the purpose of agreeing to
collect and expend development impact fees for System Improvements which
provides for a new funding mechanism for those System Improvements Costs
incurred by the District to meet the demand and growth occurring within the
City and which promotes and accommodates orderly growth and Development and
protects the public health, safety and general welfare of the residences within
the boundaries of the City; and
   G.   New growth within the City imposes and will impose increasing and
excessive demands upon the existing District's capital facilities; and
   H.   New growth within the City is expected to continue, and will place
ever-increasing demands on the District to provide and expand the District's
capital facilities to serve that new growth; and
   I.   The tax revenues generated from new Development within the City often
do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements and
expansion of existing District' capital facilities to accommodate for that new
growth; and
   J.   Section 67-8204A of the Act authorizes the City to adopt an impact fee
system and to enter into the Intergovernmental Agreement with the District to
offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to
the District's capital facilities caused by new growth and Development in the
City; and
   K.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system facilitated by the
Intergovernmental Agreement with the District, will promote the purposes set
forth in the Act, in that it would: (a) ensure that adequate District Capital
Facilities are available to serve new growth and Development; (b) promote
orderly growth and Development by establishing uniform standards by which the
City may require that those who benefit from new growth and Development pay a
Proportionate Share of the cost of new District Capital Facilities needed to
serve new growth and Development in the City; (c) establish minimum standards
for the adoption of District impact fees; (d) ensure that those who benefit
from new growth and Development are required to pay no more than their
Proportionate Share of the cost of District Capital Facilities needed to serve
new growth and Development in the City; and (e) prevent duplicate and ad hoc
Development Requirements in the City; and
   L.   The Capital Improvements Plan contains the Capital Improvements planned
by the District during the term of the Capital Improvements Plan, and such
element has been developed in conformance with the requirements Chapter 82 of
Title 67, Idaho Code; and
   M.   The Capital Improvements Plan sets forth reasonable methodologies and
analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new Development on the
District's capital facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities
created by new Development; and
   N.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the Capital Improvements Plan was based
on actual System Improvements costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. In
addition, the Capital Improvements Plan uses a fee calculation methodology that
is net of credits for the Present Value of revenues that will be generated by
new growth and Development based on historical funding patterns and that are
anticipated to be available to pay for System Improvements, including taxes,
assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers; and
   O.   The District impact fees established by this title are based on the
Capital Improvements Plan, and do not exceed System Improvements Costs to serve
new Development that will pay the District Impact Fees; and
   P.   The District's District capital facilities, included in the calculation
of fees in the Capital Improvements Plans, will benefit all new residential
Development throughout the City, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all
areas of the City as a single Service Area for purposes of calculating,
collecting, and spending the District Impact Fees collected from Developers;
and
   Q.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
Development impacts created by each type of Development covered by this title,
the development impact fees assessment of such Development covered by this
title, and the development impact fees that such Developer will be required to
pay; and
   R.   This title creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
Developers will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the costs
incurred by the District to construct and/or purchase System Improvements in
ways that benefit the Development for which each development impact fee was
paid within a reasonable period of time after the development impact fee is
paid, and in conformance with I.C.§ 67-8210; and
   S.   This title creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any District Capital
Facilities, or to replace or rehabilitate existing District Capital Facilities,
or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those facilities; and
   T.   This title creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of development impact fees, in accordance with I.C.§ 67-8204(19); and
   U.   This title is consistent with all applicable provisions of the Act
concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-1-5: PURPOSE:
   A.   This title is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement the
Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   The intent of this title is to ensure that new Development bears a
Proportionate Share of the cost of System Improvements; to ensure that such
Proportionate Share does not exceed the cost of such System Improvements
required to accommodate new Development; and to ensure that funds collected
from new Development are used for System Improvements in accordance with the
Act.
   C.   It is the further intent of this title to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of System Improvements to
new Development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by the Act.
   D.   It is not the intent of this title to collect any money from any new
Development more than the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
System Improvements created by such new Development.
   E.   It is the intent of this title that any monies collected, as an imposed
District Impact Fees, are deposited in the District Impact Fees capital
projects Trust Fund account, are never commingled with monies from a different
impact fee account, are never used for a development impact fee component
different from that for which the fee was paid, are never used to correct
current deficiencies in the District's District capital facilities, and are
never used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain or operate any District Capital
Facilities. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-1-6: ADVISORY COMMITTEE/ CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN:
   A.   The City has formed an Advisory Committee as required by I.C.§§ 67-
8205, and the committee has performed the duties required of it pursuant to
I.C.§§ 67-8205 and 67-8206(2). The City and the District intend that the
committee will continue to exist and perform those duties identified in I.C.§
67-8205 that occur following the adoption of this Development Impact Fee
Ordinance.
   B.   The District has planned for the improvement of the District's District
services capital facilities in the Capital Improvements Plan.
   C.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the City to
accommodate new Development, and would assist the District in implementing the
Capital Improvements Element of the Capital Improvements Plan.
   D.   In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the District's
District facilities, the City adopted by resolution and the District adopted by
resolution the Cascade Rural Fire Protection District Impact Fee Study and
Capital Improvement Plans (the "Capital Improvements Plan"). Galena Consulting
was hired by the District to assist the Advisory Committee in the preparation
of the study.
   E.   The methodology used in the Capital Improvements Plan, as applied
through this title, complies with all applicable provisions of Idaho law,
including those set forth in I.C.§§ 67-8204(1), (2), (16) and (23), 67-8207 and
67-8209. The incorporation of the Capital Improvements Plan by reference
satisfies the requirement in I.C.§ 67-8204(16) for a detailed description of
the methodology by which the District impact fees were calculated, and the
requirement in I.C.§ 67-8204(24) for a description of acceptable levels of
service for District's System Improvements.
   F.   In determining the Proportionate Share of the District's District
services System Improvements Costs, the Capital Improvements Plan has
considered:
      1.   The cost of the existing System Improvements; and
      2.   How the existing System Improvements have been financed; and
      3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements Costs through taxation, assessment, or Developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements Costs
through Developer or landowner contributions; and
      4.   The extent to which the new Development is required to contribute to
System Improvements Costs in the future; and
      5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area or areas; and
      6.   Extraordinary Costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development; and
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation and includes a plan for
alternative sources of revenue. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)

9-6-1: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS:
   A.   In lieu of calculating the amount of the District impact fee pursuant
to Section
9-3-3 and Exhibit III-4 of the Capital Improvements Plan, a Fee Payer may file
a request with the City that the amount of the required District impact fee be
determined by the District Administrator through an individual assessment for
the proposed Development. A request for an individual assessment process shall
involve consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information
submitted by the Fee Payer to adjust the amount of the District impact fee. If
a Fee Payer files a request for the use of an individual assessment, the Fee
Payer shall be responsible for retaining a qualified professional to prepare
the individual assessment that complies with the requirements of this title, at
the Fee Payer's expense. The Fee Payer shall, at the Fee Payer's expense, bear
the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the resulting
individual assessment complies with the requirements of this title. The Fee
Payer shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
the resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its
Proportionate Share of the cost of System Improvements, based on the District's
adopted levels of service, than the development impact fees that would
otherwise be due pursuant to pursuant to Section
9-3-3 and Exhibit III-4 of the Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same Level of Service
standards and unit costs for System Improvements used in the Capital

the District Administrator for review. The District Administrator shall issue a
written decision within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed
request for individual assessment together with all supporting information from
the Fee Payer, so as not to unreasonably delay the Developer's (Fee Payer's)
subsequent applications to the City for Building Permits.
   D.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the District
Administrator may then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by
the District Administrator as the basis for calculating the District impact
fee. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or acceptance with modifications
shall be whether the individual assessment is a more accurate measure of demand
for System Improvements element(s) created by the proposed Development, or the
costs of those facilities, than the applicable fee shown in the fee schedule
attached to the Capital Improvements Plan.
   E.   The decision by the District Administrator on an application for an
individual assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the
District impact fee, shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the fire
and/or EMS impact fee is intended to be used, and shall include an explanation
of those factors identified in I.C. § 67-8207.
   F.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with modifications
by the District Administrator then the District impact fee due under this title
for such Development shall be calculated according to such individual

type of District impact fee for which the land dedication or System
Improvements is offered. The City shall then deliver the written offer of
request to the District Administrator.
   B.   Review. After receipt of the written offer of request for credit, the
District Administrator shall review the request and determine whether the land
or System Improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing
District Capital Facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the
credit. If the District Administrator determines that the offered credit
satisfies those criteria and will be acceptable to the Board of Commissioners,
then the credit shall be issued. The District shall complete its review and
determination of an application within thirty (30) days after receipt of an
application for credit.
   C.   Credits exceeding fee amounts due. If the credit due to a Fee Payer
pursuant to sections, above, exceeds the District impact fee that would
otherwise be due from the Fee Payer pursuant to this title (whether calculated
through the fee schedule attached to the capital improvement plan or through an
independent assessment), the Fee Payer may choose to receive such credit in the
form of either:
      1.   A credit against future District impact fee due for the same System
Improvements; or

SECTION:
9-8-1: General Provisions
9-8-2: Methodology; Proportionate Methodology
9-8-3: Proportionate Share Determination
9-8-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Accounting principles. The calculation of the District impact fee shall
be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A development
impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee may result in
an incidental benefit to owners or Developers within the Service Area other
than the Fee Payer.
   B.   Levels of service. The District impact fee shall be calculated on the
basis of levels of service for Public Facilities adopted in this title that are
applicable to existing Development as well as new growth and Development. The
construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing Public
Facilities for which the District impact fee are imposed must be attributable
to the capacity demands generated by the new Development. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-8-2: METHODOLOGY; PROPORTIONATE METHODOLOGY:
The District impact fee shall not exceed a Proportionate Share of the cost of
the System Improvements determined in accordance with I.C. § 67-8207, as
amended. District impact fees shall be based on actual System Improvements
Costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. The amount of the District impact
fee shall be calculated using the methodology contained in the Capital
Improvements Plan. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
9-8-3: PROPORTIONATE SHARE DETERMINATION:
   A.   The District impact fee shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula
or method under which the District impact fee imposed does not exceed a
Proportionate Share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the District in
the provision of System Improvements to serve the new Development. The
Proportionate Share is the costs attributable to the new Development after the
District considers the following:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land or construction of System Improvements; and
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments; and
      3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the
District to System Improvements; and
      4.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.
   B.   In determining the Proportionate Share of the cost of System
Improvements to be paid by the Developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the District and accounted for in the calculation of the District
impact fees:
      1.   The costs of existing System Improvements within the Service Area;
and
      2.   The means by which existing System Improvements have been financed;
and
      3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements costs through taxation, assessments, or Developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements costs
through Developer or landowner contributions; and
      4.   The extent to which the new Development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing System Improvements in the future; and
      5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area; and
      6.   Extraordinary Costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development; and
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
CHAPTER 9
EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS
SECTION:
9-9-1: Extraordinary Impacts
9-9-1: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS:
Determinations of Extraordinary Impacts are made as follows:
   A.   In the event the City makes an initial determination that Development
may impose Extraordinary Impact, the City shall provide the Development
application to the District Administrator along with the City's initial
determination. The District Administrator shall then review and determine
whether the Development application will impose Extraordinary Impact.
   B.   If the District Administrator determines that a proposed Development
generates Extraordinary Impact that will result in extraordinary Systems
Improvements Costs, the District Administrator will notify the Fee Payer and
the City of such District impact fee determination within thirty (30) days
after District Administrator's receipt from the City of the Development
application and the City's initial determination. Such notice shall include a
statement that the potential impacts of such Development on System Improvements
are not adequately addressed by the Capital Improvements Plan, and that a
supplemental study, at the Fee Payer's expense will be required.
   C.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of Extraordinary Impact
include, but are not limited to:
      1.   An indication the assumptions used in the Capital Improvements Plan
underestimate the level of activity or impact on District Capital Facilities
from the proposed Development or activity.
   D.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a Development with
Extraordinary Impact, the District Administrator shall meet with the Fee Payer
to discuss whether the Fee Payer wants to:
      1.   Pay for the supplemental study necessary to determine the System
Improvements Costs related to the proposed Development; or
      2.   Modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary Impact; or
      3.   Withdraw the application for certification, Building Permit or
Development.
   E.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed Development's Proportionate Share of System Improvements
Costs, then the District and the Fee Payer shall jointly select an individual
or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The Fee Payer shall
enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization to pay the
costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental study to be
completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement unless the Fee
Payer agrees to a longer time.
   F.   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to:
      1.   Pay the Proportionate Share of System Improvements Costs documented
by the supplemental study; or
      2.   Modify the proposed Development to reduce such costs; or
      3.   Withdraw the application. If the Fee Payer agrees to pay the System
Improvements Costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall
be reduced to writing between the District and the Fee Payer prior to review
and consideration of any application for any Development or Building Permit
related to the proposed Development.
   G.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the Proportionate
Share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental study,
nothing in this ordinance shall obligate the City to approve Development that
results in an Extraordinary Impact to the District. (Ord. 724, 10-3-2022)
