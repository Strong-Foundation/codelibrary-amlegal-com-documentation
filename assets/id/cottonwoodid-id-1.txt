the city treasurer for payment, if not paid, shall be registered and shall draw
interest at a rate not to exceed six percent (6%) per year, as may be fixed by
the city council. Neither the holder nor the owners of any bond or warrant

except for payment from the special assessments made for the improvement for
which the bond or warrant was issued, and except as against the local
improvement guarantee fund provided in this chapter, and the city shall not be
liable to any holder or owner of such bond or warrant for any loss to the

§ 4, 1962)

The city as trustee for the fund shall be subrogated to all the rights of the

under foreclosure for delinquent local improvement assessments, or from the
rent or sale of property, title to which has been obtained subsequent to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, shall be paid into
the local improvement guarantee fund, and all delinquency certificates issued
and such property acquired shall be held by the city for the benefit of the

underlying bonds or warrants guaranteed by the fund, or to purchase the
property at county tax sales or otherwise, from the county, for the purpose of
protecting the guarantee fund. Upon acquiring title to real property, the city
may lease or sell and convey it for such price and on such terms as may be
determined by the city council, and any provisions of law, or ordinance, to the
contrary notwithstanding, and all proceeds resulting therefrom, shall belong to
and be paid into the guarantee fund; provided, however, that in the event the
city purchases the property at tax sale or otherwise, it shall not be sold for
a lesser sum than the city paid for it. (Ord. 208 § 6, 1962)
3.04.070: REPLENISHMENT OF FUND:
Whenever there is not a sufficient amount of cash in the local improvement
guarantee fund, at any time, to pay any and all warrants, together with
interest thereon, drawn against the fund, the city council may replenish the
local improvement guarantee fund by transferring or appropriating to it monies
from the general fund of the city, or other available sources, as may be
determined by the council; subject, however, to the limitations prescribed by
statute and by this chapter. Warrants drawing interest as provided in this
chapter, may be issued against the local improvement guarantee fund to meet any
financial liability against it; but at the time of making its next annual levy
the city shall provide for the levy of a sum sufficient with other resources of
the guarantee fund to pay warrants so issued and outstanding, the tax for this
purpose not to exceed one mill in any one year. (Ord. 208 § 7, 1962)
3.04.080: CLAIMS AGAINST CITY:
The holder or owner of any local improvement bond or warrant shall have no
claim thereon against the municipality by which it is issued except to the
extent of the funds created and received by assessments against the property
within the local improvement district and to the extent of this pro rata share
of any local improvement guarantee fund, authorized and created under the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 208 § 8, 1962)
3.04.090: SOURCE OF PAYMENTS:
After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter creating a
local improvement guarantee fund, any local improvement district bonds issued
thereafter shall provide that the principal sum of the bonds and the interest
thereon shall be payable out of the local improvement fund created for the
payment of the cost and expenses of the improvement, or out of any local
improvement guarantee fund duly authorized and created, and not otherwise.
(Ord. 208 § 9, 1962)
3.04.100: MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION:
The city shall have all the rights, duties and powers with reference to the
maintenance and operation of the guarantee fund as permitted or enjoined by law
and the officials of the city are required and enjoined to do any and all
things necessary for the establishment, maintenance, conduct and operation of
the guarantee fund for the purposes specified in this chapter and as required
by law; and the treasurer of the city is authorized, directed and required to
establish and maintain in his office as treasurer of the city the foregoing
local improvement guarantee fund, and to pay therein, and to pay thereout, and
to maintain and to conduct the guarantee fund, strictly in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and as required by law; and the city treasurer is
further authorized, directed and required to maintain and keep in his office
true and accurate accounts and records of all funds in, and all funds paid into
or out of the guarantee fund, together with true and correct statements and
records of the sources and origin of all monies in the guarantee fund, and true
and exact accounts and records of all bonds, warrants or interest, redeemed,
paid or purchased or purchased tax certificates or lands purchased or leased or
sold in the conduct of the guarantee fund, and of the specific local
improvement district funds paid into the guarantee fund and the bonds and
warrants, and interest thereon, for the security, payment or solution of which,
in whole or in part, the monies of the guarantee fund may be maintained and
used. (Ord. 208 § 10, 1962)
3.04.110: PROVISIONS SUPPLEMENTAL:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as in any way changing the time or
manner of calling and paying local improvement bonds, nor the method of levying
and collecting assessments and reassessments for the purpose of paying for
local improvements; but the provisions of this chapter are cumulative and
intended to supplement the existing ordinances of the city in relation to the
making of local improvements and the levying and collection of assessments and
reassessments to pay for them. (Ord. 208 § 11, 1962)

copies of the rules and regulations shall be retained at city hall for use by
the public and the contractor shall be immediately notified of all changes. The

shall deliver to the city clerk-treasurer a written agreement, on forms
provided by the city, executed by the tenant and either the record owner of the
leased premises or a third party acceptable to the city who is also presently
the holder of a current nondelinquent nontenant city service account for real
property within the city. The record owner or third party shall agree: a) to
guarantee payment of the city service account for the leased premises until
such time as the agreement is revoked, in writing, by the record owner or third
party guarantor, served upon the city clerk-treasurer, with revocation
effective upon receipt, provided, however, that such revocation shall not
release the record owner or third party guarantor for any city service account
obligation incurred prior to receipt of the written revocation by the city
clerk-treasurer, and b) that all account delinquencies for the leased premises
shall constitute a lien on the leased premises in the case of a record owner's
guarantee, or, in the case of a third party guarantor, that the third party's
city service account shall be charged for any such delinquencies.
   C.   In the event of the approval by the city of a tenant's account request,
the city shall send the city service account billings to the tenant for the
premises. In addition the city shall send a duplicate billing statement to the
record owner or third party guarantor, if requested in writing by the record
owner or third party guarantor.
   D.   It shall be the duty of tenants and record owners of any leased real
property subject to a tenant city service account to notify the city, in
writing, upon termination of any tenancy and tenant account. All tenants and
guarantors on a tenant account shall remain liable for accruing charges on the
tenant account until such time as the city receives written notice that the
tenant account is terminated or guarantee agreement revoked as provided by this
code, without regard to the identity of the persons receiving city services for
the premises.
   E.   Nothing in this section shall limit the remedies of the city with
respect to account delinquencies, including, but not limited to, the remedy of
cessation of city services to the premises. In addition to any other remedies
provided by law, the city may also cease provision of city services to a tenant
in the event of any uncured delinquency, revocation of any applicable guarantee
agreement, or failure to post or maintain any required security deposit, in the
same manner as provided for default in account payment. (Ord. 183 § 1, 2002)
13.01.040: CITY SERVICE RATES AND CHARGES:
All rates and charges for city services, including water, sewer and garbage
services, shall be established and may be amended by resolution of the city
council. (Ord. 209 § 3, 2007)
13.01.050: RATE REDUCTION FOR VACANCY OR DE MINIMIS USE:
   A.   For any premises that is vacant, or because of its nature or use is
only occupied occasionally or in a desultory manner resulting in no or de
minimis use of any city services, the city council may on petition of the owner
reduce the rate charged for city water, sewer or garbage service, or any
combination thereof, for the premises. In granting or denying the petition, the
city council may take into account one or more of the following factors, among
others: 1) the frequency and nature of past, present and anticipated use of the
premises, 2) whether the use is commercial or not for profit, 3) past, present
and anticipated use of city services for the premises, 4) the need for the city
to meet any bond, contract, franchise or financing obligations of the city for
the city services, 5) municipal budgeting obligations, 6) the need to maintain
uniform city service systems, and 7) any other factor deemed relevant by the
city council. The owner shall provide the city with all other information
requested by the city for considering the request. All decisions on rate
reduction shall be in writing. The city council may grant or deny the request
and set the amount of the reduction as it deems in the best interest of the
city. The city council also may place any terms and conditions on granting and
continuation of the rate reduction it deems in the best interest of the city.
   B.   1. Unless otherwise provided in the written decision granting the rate
reduction, all rate reductions shall automatically terminate on the earlier of
the following terminating events:
         a.   The anniversary date of granting of the rate reduction; or
         b.   Sale or transfer of fee ownership of the premises.
In the event of termination under subsection B1 of this section, the rate
reduction shall be deemed to automatically terminate on the first day of the
billing month in which the terminating event occurs. The owner shall thereafter
be responsible for payment of the rate for the city services applicable to the
premises under the ordinances and resolutions of the city as if the rate
reduction had not been granted. The city's city service account billing for the
premises at the nonreduced rate following termination shall serve as notice of
the termination.
      2.   The city may otherwise terminate any rate reduction granted upon:
         a.   Failure of the owner to permit any inspection, provide any
information requested by the city, or notify the city of any substantial
increase in use of city services as may be required under subsection C of this
section; or
         b.   The city finding that there has been a material change in the
nature of use of the premises or use of city services such that continuation of
the rate reduction would be inconsistent with this section.
In the event of termination under subsection B2 of this section, the city shall
notify the owner of the fact of the terminating event in writing and provide
for hearing before the city council to determine whether the terminating event
has occurred. Termination shall be deemed to occur on the date of the city's
decision following the hearing. The owner shall thereafter be responsible for
payment of the rate for the city services applicable to the premises under the
ordinances and resolutions of the city as if the rate reduction had not been
granted.
   C.   By requesting or accepting a rate reduction, the owner consents to the
city from time to time verifying vacancy, occupancy or city service use by
inspection of the premises, and the owner shall cooperate with the city and
provide the means of reasonable access to perform the inspections. The owner
shall notify the city upon any substantial change in use of city services for
which a rate reduction is granted no later than fifteen (15) days after
commencement of the change in use. The owner shall also provide reports of
information as may be requested by the city verifying vacancy, occupancy or
city service use to justify the continuation of any rate reduction. (Ord. 209 §
4, 2007)

13.06.020: CROSS CONNECTIONS REQUIRE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or continued in
use by the city unless the water supply is protected by backflow prevention
devices as may be required by this chapter. The installation or maintenance of
a cross connection which will endanger the water quality of the potable water
supply of the city is unlawful and is prohibited. Any such cross connection now
existing or hereafter installed is declared to be a public nuisance and shall
be abated. The control or limitation of cross connections shall be in
accordance with this chapter and the regulations set forth in section 1-8306 of

that the conditions so dictate. The city shall adopt rules and regulations as
necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 78 § 2, 1982)
13.06.030: USE OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service
connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the city, the
nature and extent of activities, or the material stored on the premises, would
present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health and/or be deleterious to
the quality of the water should a cross connection occur; even though such
cross connection does not exist at present, the backflow prevention devices
shall be installed under circumstances including, but not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with the Idaho drinking water regulations and
is acceptable to the city;
      2.   Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable,
or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain
whether or not cross connections exist;
      3.   Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross
connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short
notice to assure that cross connections do not exist;
      4.   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being
established or reestablished;
      5.   Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to
permit entry into the public water supply, or where a cross connection could
reasonably be expected to occur. This includes the handling of process waters
and cooling waters;
      6.   Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled
in such a way that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard
might result;
      7.   The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above
categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public
water supply. A backflow prevention device shall be installed at those
facilities unless the city determines that no hazard exists:
         a.   Sewage treatment plants,
         b.   Chemical or other industrial plants,
         c.   Agricultural chemical storage, formulation and distribution
facilities,
         d.   Petroleum storage facilities;
      8.   Other premises, as specified by the city, where backflow prevention
devices are required to protect the public water supply.
   B.   The type of protective device required shall depend on the degree of
hazard which exists:
      1.   An air gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the public water supply may be
contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other
contaminant which could cause a health or system hazard;
      2.   In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not
hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air gap separation, or a
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed.
   C.   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed
at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are not used, or
at a location designated by the city. The device shall be located so as to be
readily accessible for maintenance and testing, and furthermore, where no part
of the device will be submerged.
   D.   Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed
under the supervision of, and with the approval of, the supervisor.
   E.   Any protective device required by this chapter shall be a model
approved by the city. A double check valve assembly or a reduced pressure
principle backflow device will be approved if it has successfully passed
performance tests of the University of Southern California Engineering Center
or other testing laboratories satisfactory to the engineer. These devices shall
be furnished and installed by and at the expense of the customer.
   F.   Backflow prevention devices installed pursuant to this chapter, except
atmospheric vacuum breakers, shall be inspected and tested annually, or more
often if necessary. Inspections, tests and maintenance shall be at the
customer's expense.

backflow prevention devices at the point from which the water for irrigation is
taken from the public water supply.
   H.   Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance,
testing or inspection of backflow prevention devices required by this chapter
shall be grounds for the termination of water service to the premises, or, in
the alternative, the installation of air gap separation at the customer's
expense. (Ord. 78 § 3, 1982)
13.06.040: CROSS CONNECTION INSPECTION:
   A.   No water shall be delivered to any structure hereafter built within the
city or within areas served by city water until the same shall have been
inspected by the city for possible cross connections and have been approved as
being free of same.
   B.   Any construction for industrial or other purposes which is classified
as hazardous facilities pursuant to section
13.06.030 of this chapter, where it is reasonable to anticipate intermittent
cross connections, or as determined by the city, shall be protected by the
installation of one or more backflow prevention devices at the point of service
from the public water supply or any other location designated by city.
   C.   Inspections shall be made periodically of all buildings, structures, or
improvements of any nature now receiving water through the city's system, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether cross connections exist. Such inspections
shall be made by the city. (Ord. 78 § 4, 1982)
13.06.050: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
In the event an improper cross connection is not corrected within the time
limit set by the city, or, in the event the city is refused access to any
property for the purpose of determining whether or not cross connections exist,
delivery of water to the property shall cease until the deficiency is corrected
to the city's satisfaction. In addition, the city may effect the necessary
repairs or modifications at the expense of the property owner and refuse
delivery of water to the property until the cost thereof has been paid. (Ord.
78 § 5, 1982)
13.06.060: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, refuses to comply with, or
resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter or the rules
and regulations as adopted by the city, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and, upon conviction thereof, shall for each offense be punished by a fine in
any sum not exceeding three hundred dollars ($300.00) or imprisonment for a
term not exceeding ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

shall be established by resolution of the city council. Such charges may vary
between users on a case by case basis as deemed necessary and appropriate by
the city council. The city reserves the right to amend such charges by
resolution of the city council from time to time as deemed in the best interest
of the city.
   C.   Except as modified in this chapter or resolution related to the
particular connection, connections to and use of the city municipal water and
sewer systems under this chapter shall be subject to all other ordinances,
codes, regulations and laws applicable to connections to and use of the
systems, including, but not limited to, those related to procedures for
billing, payment and collection of charges for connection to and use of the
systems. All charges for water and sewer services provided under this chapter
shall be a lien on the real property served by the connection, and receipt of
such service shall constitute consent to such lien. In addition to all other
remedies of the city, which shall be nonexclusive and cumulative, the city may
immediately terminate provision of water or sewer services under this section
and disconnect the user from the city's systems in the event the user fails to
comply with or violates any such applicable resolution, code, ordinance or law,
including, but not limited to, failure to pay any charges due and payable.

ARTICLE I. AUTHORITY
15.04.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state has in the Idaho Code delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and
city council of the City of Cottonwood, (hereafter “City”), ordain as follows
in this chapter. (Ord. 96 § 1.1, 1987; amd. Ord. 254, 7-12-2021)
15.04.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately FLOODPROOFED, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 96 § 1.2, 1987; amd. Ord. 254,
7-12-2021)
15.04.030: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote health, safety and general
welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   I.   To participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and
disaster relief. (Ord. 96 § 1.3, 1987; amd. Ord. 254, 7-12-2021)
15.04.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting development that is dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that development and facilities vulnerable to floods be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 96 § 1.4, 1987; amd. Ord. 254, 7-12-2021)

actions and report any VARIANCES to the federal insurance administration upon
request. (Ord. 96 § 4.4-1, 1987; amd. Ord. 254, 7-12-2021)
15.04.220: CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES:
   A.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation
standard may be issued is for NEW CONSTRUCTION and SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS to
be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the BASE FLOOD
level, providing subsections
15.04.210(D1) through (D11) of this chapter has been fully considered. As the
lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the
VARIANCE increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of STRUCTURES listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in this section.
   C.   VARIANCES shall not be issued within a designated FLOODWAY if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   VARIANCES shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   E.   VARIANCES shall only be issued upon:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the VARIANCE would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      3.   A determination that the granting of a VARIANCE will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in subsection
15.04.210D of this chapter, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   F.   VARIANCES as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are
based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece
of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily
address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such,
VARIANCES from the flood provisions should be quite rare.
   G.   VARIANCES may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of FLOODPROOFING than watertight or dry
floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage
potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection A of
this section.
   H.   Any applicant to whom a VARIANCE is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the BASE FLOOD ELEVATION and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced LOWEST
FLOOR elevation. (Ord. 96 § 4.4-2, 1987; amd. Ord. 254, 7-12-2021)

compliance with this chapter before the notice of Building Code violation is
recorded. If the appeal is approved, the City will specify actions to be taken
by the building official to release the violation. The City may elect to add or
remove conditions of remedial action as it deems necessary and appropriate to
secure compliance with this chapter.

In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are created and
established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the
approach surfaces as they apply to the Cottonwood municipal airport. Such zones
are shown on the Cottonwood municipal airport zoning map, consisting of one
sheet, dated, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and
is on file in the city clerk-treasurer's office. An area which is located in
more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with
the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are established and
defined as follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty
feet (250') wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one
thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal distance of five
thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface. Its centerline is the

of five thousand feet (5,000') radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines
tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.
   D.   Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). (Ord. 154 § 1, 1997: Ord.
142 § 3, 1995)
17.50.040: AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no objects of natural growth shall be allowed to
grow in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the
applicable height limit herein established for such a zone. Such applicable
height limitations are established for each of the zones in question as
follows:
   A.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: Slopes twenty feet (20') outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet
(5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
   B.   Transitional Zones: Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevations as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation, which is three thousand fifty feet (3,050')
above the airport elevation, which is three thousand four hundred seventy four
feet (3,474') above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are
established height limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface,
and extending to where they intersect the conical zone.

(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty feet (350') above the airport elevation.
   E.   Excepted Height Limitations: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of
any tree to a height up to fifty feet (50') above the surface of the land,
except as stated in subsection
17.50.070A of this chapter. (Ord. 154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 4, 1995)
17.50.050: USE RESTRICTIONS:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water with any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, making it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes
of pilots using the airport, create fire strike hazards, or otherwise in any
way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft
intending to use the airport. (Ord. 154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 5, 1995)
17.50.060: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Regulations Not Retroactive: The regulations prescribed by this chapter
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein
shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any
structure, other construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and is diligently
prosecuted.
   B.   Marking And Lighting: Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is required
to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport administrator, to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstructions. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the city.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses; Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the airport
administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated
or decayed, that particular nonconforming condition shall be changed or
eliminated as to comply with the restrictions set forth in this chapter. (Ord.
154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 6, 1995)
17.50.070: VARIANCES:
   A.   Variances; General: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height
of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, not in accordance with the
regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Cottonwood city
planning commission for a variance from such regulations. The application for a
variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for a variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Cottonwood City Planning
Commission unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport
Administrator for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If
those so named do not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days, the
City Council may act on its own to grant or deny such application.
   B.   Variances; Obstruction, Marking And Lighting: Any variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain at
the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the Planning Commission, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the City at its own expense to install, operate and
maintain the necessary marking and lights. (Ord. 154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 7,
1995)
17.50.080: ENFORCEMENT:
It shall be the duty of the Airport Administrator to administer the regulations
prescribed herein and with the assistance of the Chief of Police, to enforce
the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for variances shall be made to
the Airport Administrator upon a form published for the purpose. The Airport
Administrator will indicate upon the application his or her recommendations and
shall forthwith transmit them to the Planning Commission for its action. (Ord.
154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 8, 1995)
17.50.090: APPEALS:

Commission, made in the administration of this title, may appeal to the City
Council pursuant to section

17.50.100: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by any decision of the City
Council pursuant to this chapter may seek judicial review under the procedures
provided by 67-5212, subsections (b) through (g) and 67-5612, Idaho Code. (Ord.

1995)
17.50.120: CONFLICTING REGULATIONS:
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether this conflict be with respect to the height of structures, or
trees, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall
govern and prevail. (Ord. 154 § 1, 1997: Ord. 142 § 12, 1995)
