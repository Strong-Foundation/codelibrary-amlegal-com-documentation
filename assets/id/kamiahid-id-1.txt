complete the abatement and assess back the costs thereof against the property
in like fashion as for tax assessments.
   B.   Failure to request a public hearing within the time required shall be
deemed conclusive as to the existence of the nuisance as described in the
declaration posted and mailed.
   C.   Upon receipt of a request for a public hearing, the mayor shall
establish a date for a public hearing, to be held no less than ten (10) days,
nor more than thirty (30) days from receipt of said report. The public hearing
shall be to determine if a nuisance exists, and assessment of administrative
costs, and directions for removal or remedy.
      1.   Notice of said hearing shall be provided by certified mail to any
person or entity requesting a public hearing, to the last registered owner of
the real property upon which local law enforcement or the fire chief has
determined a nuisance is present. Notice shall be deemed completed upon
mailing.
      2.   The city council shall hear all facts and testimony deemed
pertinent. The facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of
the property, vehicles, waste matter, or any other evidence regarding the
existence of a nuisance. The city council shall not be limited by the technical
rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the alleged nuisance is
located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement in
time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence
of the nuisance with his or her reasons for such denial.
      3.   The city council, upon a finding that a public nuisance exists, may
impose such conditions and take such action as deemed appropriate under the
circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter, including delaying the
time or removal or remedy of the nuisance or part thereof, if, in its opinion,
the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city
council must make written findings of fact and conclusions of law, and may
order the nuisance remedied or removed from the property as a public nuisance
and disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs
to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is
located. The order requiring removal shall include:
         a.   A description of the nuisance or part thereof and the correct
identification number and license number of any vehicle constituting a part or
all of the nuisance, if available, at the site;
         b.   A statement that the nuisance must be removed or remedied within
thirty (30) days of adoption of the order, unless some other time period is
specified by the city council.
      4.   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the city
council but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.
   D.   Upon the expiration of thirty (30) days after mailing of a declaration
of nuisance if no hearing is requested, or the later of thirty (30) days after
adoption of the order declaring a condition to be a public nuisance, or thirty
(30) days from the date of mailing of notice of the decision to an interested
person who makes a written presentation if such notice is required by this
section, or the date specified in the order if a date is specified, if the
nuisance remains in whole or in part, the local law enforcement or fire chief
shall take steps to cause the abatement of the nuisance by removal of the
offending materials, whether by fire suppression exercise, by use of city
employees, or by letting an appropriate contract in accord with the contracting
procedures of the city of Kamiah. The waste matter which constitutes the public
nuisance may be disposed of by removal to a garbage transfer station, dump,

Notes
1 1. IC § 49-208.
10.28.010: APPLICABILITY OF SPEED LAWS:
The traffic laws regulating speed of vehicles shall be as declared and
determined by this title upon the basis of engineering and traffic
investigation. Certain speed regulations shall be applicable upon specified
streets or in certain areas, in which event it shall be prima facie unlawful
for any person to drive a vehicle at a speed in excess of any speed so declared
in this title when signs are in place giving notice thereof. (Prior code §10-
205(1))
10.28.020: TRAFFIC INVESTIGATION; SPEED LIMIT ON CERTAIN STREETS:
   A.   In General: Pursuant to the authority of Idaho Code section 49-207, as
amended, the city has caused a traffic investigation report to be compiled by
the city police, which traffic investigation takes into account the residential
character of the neighborhoods within the city and in the urban districts
within the city and the city finds that said traffic investigation is
appropriate and hereby approves the same. The city generally finds that it is
appropriate to reduce the speed generally within the city below thirty five
(35) miles per hour as is hereinafter set forth, except in school zones which
require an additional reduction as is hereinafter set forth. The said traffic
investigation report shall be maintained in triplicate by the city clerk and
shall be available for public inspection upon request.
      1.   Speed Limits Designated: Except as otherwise posted, and except in
school zones, the speed limit in all areas of the city shall be twenty five
(25) miles per hour.
      2.   School Zones: City streets around or approaching any school within
this city are hereby declared to require a reduced speed of fifteen (15) miles
per hour for vehicular traffic during school hours. Therefore, upon the
recommendation in writing to the city council by the city marshal, or his
designee, the city council shall adopt specific areas around such schools
wherein the speed limit shall be fifteen (15) miles per hour. A list of the
school zones wherein the fifteen (15) mile per hour speed limit shall be
enforced is on file in the office of the city clerk and hereby incorporated by
this reference. The city shall post appropriate signs in accordance with the
Idaho Code within the school zone area indicating such reduced speed is
required.
      3.   Further Reduction Of Speed Limits: The residents of the city may
petition the city council in writing for a further reduction in the speed
limits herein specified on specific streets within the city where the residents
feel a particular hazard exists. The city council may at its next regularly
scheduled meeting direct a traffic survey for that particular area, pursuant to
Idaho Code section 49-207, as amended, and thereafter determine whether the
speed shall be reduced by further appropriate ordinance.
   B.   Bryan Drive, Baker Road/Addition, South Peach And Hopoch Hill Road:
      1.   Pursuant to Idaho Code section 49-207(2), the city has had a traffic
investigation conducted by the Kamiah marshal's office encompassing Bryan
Drive, Baker Road/Addition, South Peach and Hopoch Hill Road. Said traffic
investigation, dated January 2, 1998, considers the residential nature of the
area, the grade and width of the road, the weather conditions and other
characteristics of the area in recommending that the speed limit in the area
covered by the investigation should be posted a maximum fifteen (15) miles per
hour for public safety reasons. Said traffic investigation is incorporated by
this reference and the original report is on file in the office of the city
clerk.
      2.   The city council, on the basis of the said traffic investigation in
subsection B1 of this section, finds that the previous speed limit for the area
is greater than is reasonable and safe, and declares that the speed limit in
the area encompassed by said traffic investigation be set at fifteen (15) miles
per hour. A map of the affected area is on file in the office of the city clerk
and incorporated by this reference. (Ord. 98-11 §§1, 2, 1998: Ord. 96-3, 1996:

The traffic engineer is authorized to regulate the timing of traffic signals so
as to permit the movement of traffic in an orderly and safe manner at speeds
otherwise applicable within the district or at intersections and shall erect
appropriate signs giving notice thereof. (Prior code §10-205(3))
10.28.040: SPEED CHECK:
The speed of any motor vehicle may be checked by the use of radio microwaves or
any other electrical device. The results of such checks shall be accepted as
prima facie evidence of the speed of such motor vehicle in the police
magistrate court or legal proceedings when the speed of the motor vehicle is at
issue. The driver of any such motor vehicle may be arrested without warrant
under this chapter, provided the arresting officer is in uniform or displays
his badge of authority; provided further, that such officer has observed the
record of the speed of such motor vehicle by the radio microwaves or other
electrical device, or has received a radio message from the officer who
observed the speed of the motor vehicle recorded by the radio microwaves or
other electrical device. (Ord. 16 §1, 1959: prior code §10-205(4))

from handling, prohibited discharges or otherwise tampering with or plugging
said sewer lines, the violator shall pay for all costs incurred in connection
with the repairs of said system and/or for any damages that may result from the
tampering with, prohibited discharges or plugging of said sewer system. It
shall be unlawful for any person to deposit any substance, which may tend to
obstruct the flow or damage said sewer, in any sewer opening. (Ord. 2004-1 §1,
2003)
13.12.130: GREASE TRAPS REQUIRED:
In all cases where a building is used as a hotel, boarding house, restaurant,
service station, garage, etc., the owner or occupant shall provide a properly
constructed grease trap through which all wastes of a greasy nature shall be
drained. The mayor and city council shall have the authority, and he/she is
hereby authorized and directed to compel any person to provide and use a grease
trap as aforesaid, whenever, in his or her judgment, the same is necessary.
(Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.140: INTERCEPTORS:
Grease, oil and sand interceptors or other necessary removal facilities shall
be installed on the premises when, in the opinion of the mayor and city
council, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
grease in excessive amounts, high concentrations of blood, fruit, vegetables,
grain liquors, milk wastes, flammable wastes, sand and other harmful
ingredients. All interceptors or removal facilities shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the mayor and city council and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Where installed, all
grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner or
occupant, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times.
(Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.150: AUTHORITY; CONNECTION TO SYSTEM:
The mayor and city council of the city are hereby empowered and it is hereby
made their duty, in all cases where there is a public sanitary sewer within two
hundred feet (200') to notify every owner or person in charge of land or
premises requiring a sanitary sewer building connection as specified in section
13.12.030 of this chapter to comply with the provisions of that section within
sixty (60) days or cease to use or occupy the land. A lessee on land shall be
deemed to be in charge. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.160: CONNECTION PERMIT REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to install or alter any sanitary sewer within the city, or
to tap into or connect to any sanitary sewer main line without first having
obtained from said city a permit therefor. An application for a connection to
the city sewer system shall be made at the office of city hall and no
connection shall be made to any sewer main without a valid permit, and the
sewer tap at the main shall be made by the city. It shall be unlawful for any
person to uncover, make any connection with or opening into, use, alter, or
disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.170: EXCAVATION PERMIT REQUIRED:

public easement until the applicant has first obtained an excavation permit as
required by the city. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.180: SIDE SEWER EXTENSION OR REPAIR PERMIT REQUIRED:
When any sewer service line (side sewer) or private sewer connected to any
public sewer become obstructed, broken or out of order, the owner, agent, or
tenant of such premises shall repair the same at his or her own expense. No
person shall construct, re-lay, repair, or extend any side sewer until the
person doing said work has obtained the appropriate sewer permit for it. It
shall be unlawful for any person to extend any private sewer or side sewer
beyond the limits of the building or property for which a permit has been given
without obtaining a new permit for desired extension. The existence of a sewer
permit shall in no way be construed as making permissible any work for which
the city may require an excavation permit. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.190: INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF SEWER SERVICE LINE:
When a permit for a sewer service line (side sewer) has been granted, the sewer
tap at the sewer main will be furnished and installed by the city. All
excavation, fill material, compacting, pavement repair, piping and material to
and including exposing the sewer main is at the expense of the person or firm
desiring sewer service. The size and slope of the service line shall be subject
to approval of the mayor and city council, but in no event shall the diameter
be less than four inches (4"). The slopes of such four inch (4") service line
shall be not less than one-eighth inch (1/8") per foot, except when
specifically otherwise approved by the mayor and city council. Whenever two (2)
or more residences discharge into a sewer, diameter of service sewer shall not
be less than six inches (6"). The materials and installation shall be subject
to inspection and approval by the mayor and city council. All sewer service
lines (side sewers) in any new subdivisions may be installed as part of the
construction of the new sewer collection system within said subdivision when,
in the opinion of the mayor and city council, it is in the city's best
interests to have or allow said sewer service lines to be installed. (Ord.
2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.200: REVOKE PERMISSION TO CONNECT:
Permission given to connect sewers and drains shall be upon the express
condition that the mayor and city council may for good cause revoke the same
and the person making such connection, or his or her successor(s) in interest,
shall not have right to claim any damage in consequence of such permission
being revoked. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.210: CONSTRUCTION, STANDARD DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS; INSPECTION:
All construction or reconstruction of public, private and side sewers shall in
be accordance with standard drawings and standard specifications and subject to
inspection by the city. Plan and profile drawing shall be prepared for all new
sewer mains (whether public or private) and for all sanitary sewer extensions,
reconstructions, or renovations; and shall be reviewed and approved by the city
and, when necessary, by the Idaho department of health and welfare before any
construction work on said sewer lines is started. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.220: RIGHT TO ENTER PREMISES FOR INSPECTION:
The mayor and city council have the right to enter any premises connected with
any public sewer at all reasonable hours to determine that there is compliance
with the provisions of this chapter. If conflict is noted, the owner of said
premises or his or her agent shall be directed to alter, repair or reconstruct
said sewer facilities within fifteen (15) days. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.230: INDUSTRIAL WASTES:
Each person or firm desiring to make a connection to the public sewer for the
purpose of discharging industrial wastes thereto shall prepare and file with
the city a report which shall include actual or predicted data relating to the
quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged. The city may
authorize private treatment facilities, provided that all federal, state, and
local laws and regulations are fully complied with. Industrial waste charges
may be based upon the amount of flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and
suspended solids (SS) or any combination thereof as may be recommended by this
chapter. The sewage collection and treatment charges for industrial waste shall
completely pay for all collection and treatment costs associated with said
wastes. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.240: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS; INDUSTRIAL WASTE DISCHARGE:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any person(s) or
organization whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may
be admitted to the wastewater collection and treatment system either before or
after pretreatment, provided that there is no impairment of the functioning of
the wastewater treatment system by reason of the admission of such wastes, and
no extra costs are incurred by the city, without recompense by said person(s)
or organization. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.250: EXTENSIONS OF SEWER MAINS WITHIN CITY SERVICE AREA:
The mayor and city council shall be authorized to construct, or cause to be
constructed, extensions to the sewer system if one of the following conditions
exist:
   A.   The annual anticipated revenue made available to the city from the
customers to be immediately served by such an extension is not less than one-
tenth (1/10) of the actual cost to the city for the construction of said
extension.
   B.   The mayor and city council declare that the sewer main extension is
needed for the overall benefit and improvement of the entire sewage collection
system.
   C.   The city council approves a contract for construction of the extension
with a party or parties desiring sewer service. Provided however, that
subdividers within or adjacent to the city service area shall construct at
their own expense all sewer mains within their subdivisions or developments,
except that the city will be responsible for those sewer line costs set forth
in section
13.12.380 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.260: EXTENSIONS OF SEWER SERVICE AND MAINS IN AREAS CONTIGUOUS TO CITY
SERVICE AREA:
In areas contiguous to the city service area that may be annexed to the city,
the city may require such areas to be annexed before sewer service is provided.
All noncity resident property owners who request city sewer service must first
submit an official city application for annexation of the property into the
city limits. The completion, submission and approval of the application for
annexation shall be prerequisite to any sewer service being provided to any
nonresident property owners. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.270: EXTENSION OF SEWER LINES OUTSIDE CITY SERVICE AREA:
Sewer lines shall not, without the city council's approval, be extended outside
the city service area; however, when there will be special benefit and
improvement to the city, by reason of an extension outside the city service
area, special arrangements may be made with the council to allow said
extension, provided that the area to be serviced outside of the city service
area shall not benefit to a greater extent than like areas provided with sewer
service within the city service area, and provided further, that no such
agreements shall be made unless adequate sewer line capacity and sewage
treatment capacity is available for such sewer service. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.280: PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF COSTS OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE:
All systems of charges and fees to users within and without the city service
area shall assure that each recipient of wastewater collection and treatment
services will pay its proportionate share of the costs of operation and
maintenance (including equipment replacement) of any waste collection and
treatment services provided by the city. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.290: FEES FOR CONNECTION:
Before any sewer connection permit is issued for the installation of any sewer
service connection (side sewer), the person making the application therefor
shall pay to the city both an "equity buy in" fee and a sewer connection charge
as herein set forth:
   A.   An "equity buy in" fee shall be paid for each connection made to the
sewer system for wastewater collection lines and for wastewater treatment
plant.
   B.   A connection and inspection charge shall be paid for each connection to
be made to the sewer system, except for connections made in areas where sewer
mains were installed by local improvement district assessment, in accordance
with the following schedule:
      1.   Single-family dwelling or unit, each sewer connection: Two thousand
five hundred dollars ($2,500.00).
      2.   Multi-facility dwelling or unit, each sewer connection: Two thousand
five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) plus the following:
         a.   Mobile home courts: Five hundred dollars ($500.00) per each
trailer space in excess of one.
         b.   Motels, motor hotels, cabin courts, travel trailer courts: Five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per room, cabin or trailer space.
         c.   Apartment houses, duplexes, and similar multiple living units,
for each building: Five hundred dollars ($500.00) per living unit in excess of
one.
         d.   Condominiums and townhouses: Five hundred dollars ($500.00) per
living unit in excess of one.
         e.   Commercial buildings and others not specifically covered above:
Ten dollars ($10.00) per plumbing fixture in excess of four (4) per premises.
   C.   All "equity buy in" and service connection charges shall be paid at the
time the service connection is requested.
   D.   Failure to pay the connection and inspection charge shall result in a
connection/inspection charge of two (2) times the regular charge and may result
in a nonissuance by the city of the occupancy permit.
   E.   The above "equity buy in" fees and sewer connection charge will not
apply to or be charged against reconstruction of any existing sewer service
line serving any existing dwelling, building, etc. It is intended that both the
"equity buy in" fee and a sewer connection charge be charged only where a new
building is being constructed upon previously undeveloped property. These fees
may be changed from time to time by ordinance of the city council as such
charges are deemed necessary. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.300: SERVICE CALL CHARGE:
The mayor and city council may require a service charge in an amount not to
exceed the actual cost to the city for service calls which are only for the
convenience and benefit of the customer. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.310: FLOW CHARGES:
The flow charges shall be based upon actual monthly water usage (metered water)
during the months of November through April. During all other months, flow
charges shall be based upon the average metered monthly usage of the six (6)
months mentioned above. Exceptions to the above provisions shall be by council
action only. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.320: SCHEDULE OF RATES AND CHARGES; OWNER RESPONSIBILITY:
A sewer charge shall be levied on all users of the sewage collection and
treatment facilities to cover the actual or estimated cost of operation,
maintenance, replacement, and financing of the facilities. The user charge
system shall distribute these costs to each user or user class in approximate
portion to such user's contribution to the total wastewater load of such
facilities as follows:
   A.   Review And Revise: The council shall review the sewer use rate and,
based upon the actual costs of operations, maintenance, replacement and
financing of wastewater collection and treatment services, shall revise the
sewer use rates accordingly.
   B.   Notification: The city shall notify each user of any changes in the
sewer use charges attributable to the collection and treatment services.
   C.   Rates: There are established rates and charges for all properties
within the city of Kamiah connected with and using the facilities of the sewer
collection and disposal system of the city. Such charges shall be set and
amended by the city council as determined necessary by the city council by city
council resolution.
   D.   Owner Responsibility:
      1.   All sewer charges shall be the responsibility of and billed to the
deeded property owner of any property served by the Kamiah sewer systems.
      2.   For any property upon which is located separate businesses, or
separate residential units or a combination of business and residential units,
the property owner shall receive and pay the billing. In addition, a property
owner will also be charged applicable rates for each of the separate businesses
and residences that are located on the real property served, regardless of the
nature of the business, indoor facilities or use.
      3.   The deeded owner must, as a condition of receiving continued
service, sign an agreement with the city of Kamiah to be responsible for the
bill for sewer services, even if the property is rented or leased to another.
      4.   For all unpaid sewer charges, the city shall be entitled to a lien
on the real property served by the sewer system to be filed in the county where
sewer services are provided. In the event of nonpayment of a sewer bill, in
addition to the other remedies provided herein, the city shall be entitled to a
lien on the real property served by the sewer system for all unpaid bills. Such
lien shall be filed for all claimed unpaid amounts within six (6) months of the
last action on the account and then foreclosed in the appropriate district
court, by commencement of action within one year of the filing of the lien. The
lien may be joined with a lien for other unpaid public services, pursuant to
this code and Idaho law.
      5.   In the event payment for sewer services is made by check and the
check be returned or dishonored for any reason, the city may collect from the
owner of the property served any bank charges incurred by the city of Kamiah as
a result of said dishonor which shall be added to the next regular utility bill
and furthermore, the city may discontinue providing water service to the
property until said fees and charges are paid.
      6.   The city council may, by resolution, direct that a portion of the
charges received be set aside in a special account dedicated for a future
wastewater treatment facility.
      7.   When service is provided for less than a full month, the charges for
service shall be prorated on a daily basis. (Ord. 2008-7 §1, 2008: Ord. 2006-
7 §1, 2006: Ord. 2006-1 §1, 2005: Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.330: RETAPPING FEE:
In the event that it is necessary for the city to retap any sewer main under
any circumstances, there shall be a retapping fee charged according to the
city's actual costs related to any retap. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.340: DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS:
When bills are not paid within thirty (30) days from the past due date, the
mayor and city council shall issue an order to shut off and discontinue water
service to such delinquent customer. In case service is discontinued for
delinquency, it shall not be restored until the delinquency is paid, or until
arrangements for payment satisfactory to the city clerk have been made,
together with a fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for discontinuing and
restoring service. The fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) shall be payable
whenever a service trip is made for the purpose of discontinuing service
because of nonpayment, even though an actual shutoff may not actually have
occurred. In the event that a delinquent customer fails to pay his or her bill
within the time set forth above, the city may discontinue city water service or
remove or close sewer connection, and enter upon the property for accomplishing
such purposes. The expense of digging up and unplugging the sewer service line,
as well as the expense of restoring said sewer service line back to an operable
condition, is a debt due to the city and may be recovered by legal action
against the sewer user, in addition to the twenty five dollar ($25.00) fee set
forth above. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.350: MATERIALS AND INSTALLATIONS:
   A.   All sanitary sewer main line and storm drain main line materials,
manholes, etc., and their installation shall be in accordance with city
standard specifications of the construction of sanitary sewers and storm sewers
and the applicable standard drawings depicting various sewer line installation
details.
   B.   All sewer system material shall be of the class, strength, thickness,
etc., necessary to accommodate or provide for the depth of cover over the pipe,
the type of material and bedding around the pipe, and the type, magnitude and
extent of the external loads being applied to the pipe.
   C.   The city must approve all materials. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.360: DESIGN:
   A.   Registered Professional Engineer: The plans for all sewer lines, sewage
lift stations, sewage treatment facilities, etc., shall be designed, signed and
sealed by a registered professional engineer licensed in the state of Idaho as
the city deems necessary.
   B.   State Health Department Requirements: All sewer lines, lift stations,
sewage treatment facilities, etc., shall be designed and approved in accordance
with state health department requirements.
   C.   Minimum Sanitary Main Size: Minimum sanitary main size shall be eight
inch (8") diameter, unless a special design is approved by the city, where the
sewer line may be reduced. Minimum storm drain size shall be eight inch (8")
diameter. Larger sizes shall be required by the city's overall sewer system
master plan or as needed to provide adequate sewage carrying capacity for the
area (and surrounding developable area) being developed and/or annexed to the
city. Minimum building service line (side sewer) size shall be four inches (4")
in diameter.
   D.   General Provisions For Design: In general, sewers shall be sufficiently
deep so as to receive sewage from basements and to prevent freezing. Sewer
lines shall have at least three feet (3') of cover (from the top of the sewer
line pipe to the ground or street surface) unless a special design is approved
by the city whereby the sewer line is protected from freezing by special means
or method and the sewer is protected from "heaving" by installation of crushed
gravel backfill material under, around and over the pipe.
   E.   Mean Velocities: All sewer mains shall be designed and constructed to
provide mean velocities, when flowing full of not less than two feet (2') per
second. All sewer service lines (side sewers) shall be designed and constructed
to provide mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than three feet (3')
per second. The following are minimum slopes which should be provided; however,
slopes greater than these are desirable:
Sewer Size Minimum Slope
(Inches)   In Feet Per
           One Hundred Feet
Sewer Size Minimum Slope
(Inches)   In Feet Per
           One Hundred Feet
4 inch     2.00
6 inch     1.00
8 inch     0.40
10 inch    0.28
12 inch    0.22
15 inch    0.15
18 inch    0.12
21 inch    0.10
24 inch    0.08
27 inch    0.067
30 inch    0.058
36 inch    0.046
 
Under special conditions, if detailed justifiable reasons are given, slopes
slightly less than those required above (i.e., to provide 2.0 or 3.0 flow/feet
per second (FSP) velocity when flowing full) may be permitted. Such decreased
slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 0.3 of the
diameter or greater for the design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes
are proposed, the design engineer must furnish with his or her report his or
her computation of the depths of flow, in such pipes at the minimum and average
rates of flow for a typical day. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slopes
between manholes (i.e., a manhole shall be constructed at each point where the
sewer line slope or grade changes).
   F.   Manhole Locations: Manholes shall be located no more than four hundred
feet (400') apart on lines fifteen inches (15") in diameter or smaller.
Manholes may be located up to six hundred feet (600') apart on lines larger
than fifteen inches (15") in diameter. Manholes shall be installed at all
locations where sewer lines eight inches (8") in diameter or larger intersect,
join together or make a bend. All dead end sewer lines shall have a manhole
installed on the end thereof or a cleanout where approved by the mayor and city
council.
   G.   Sewer Main Line Drop Through Manhole: The flow line of the main sewer
line as it enters and leaves any manhole shall be determined by the engineer.
   H.   Lateral Sewer Line Connection At Manholes: Lateral sanitary sewer lines
shall not enter a manhole at an elevation appreciably higher than the sewer
main line. The flow line(s) of any lateral line(s) shall be positioned within a
manhole as follows:
      1.   The flow line of the main sewer shall be at least 0.05 foot below
the flow line of any of the lateral sewer lines entering the manhole.
      2.   Where the diameter of the main line and the lateral line differ by
less than 0.5 foot, the top of the lateral line shall be positioned even with
the top of the main line on its highest (inlet) side.
      3.   Where the diameter of the main and lateral differ by 0.5 foot or
more, the two (2) sewer line inverts shall be positioned at the same elevation.
      4.   Where a lateral sewer line would enter a manhole at an elevation of
three feet (3') or more above the main sewer line, "drop manhole" construction
shall be utilized to locate or position the flow line of the lateral line (in
relation to that of the main line) as indicated above.
      5.   Where a lateral line would enter a manhole at an elevation of less
than three feet (3') above the main sewer line, the grade or slope of the
lateral shall be adjusted so that its flow line is located (in relation to that
of the main line) as indicated above. Individual building service lines may
enter a "dead end" manhole (a manhole on the upstream and permanent end of a
sewer line) and provided further that the individual building service lines
must enter the manhole at such elevation that the top of the service line is
level with the top of the sewer main line and that the poured in place concrete
floor of the manhole brings the flow lines of the service lines into the flow
line of the main line in a smooth continuous manner.
   I.   Sanitary Sewer Lines And Water Lines: Sanitary sewer lines and water
lines shall, wherever possible, be located on opposite sides of the street, a
ten foot (10') (out to out) horizontal separation between water line facilities
and sewer line facilities (either sanitary or storm) and an eighteen inch (18")
(out to out) vertical separation between said line facilities shall always be
maintained, unless a specific variance to this requirement is obtained from the
city. The applicable separation requirements of the Idaho health department
shall also be complied with.
   J.   Drawing Requirements: All drawings shall be on linen or Mylar in pencil
or ink and of such quality that they clearly show the dimensions, locations,
sizes, etc., of all facilities represented thereon. All sewer line manholes,
inlet boxes, building service lines, etc., shall be clearly shown and
identified by name and station or other means of horizontal location. Sewer
lines shall be shown on both plans and profile unless the length of said sewer
line or sewer line extension is so short that the city waives this requirement.
If a profile of the sewer line is not provided it shall be located in the
vertical plane by elevations on the flow line of the pipe at all manholes,
inlet boxes, etc., and at other such locations and intervals as the city may
require. Drawing shall be drawn on a scale of one inch equals one hundred feet
(1" = 100') unless the amount of detail, topography, etc., necessitate their
being drawn on a larger scale (i.e., 1" = 40') to provide the clarity and
completeness needed on the drawings.
   K.   Approval: The mayor and city council must approve the design of all
sewer lines and all sewer system plans. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.370: AS BUILT DRAWINGS:
   A.   "As built" or "record" drawings of sewer main plans shall be prepared
by a professional engineer and the "corrected" original drawing or duplicate
Mylar copy of the "corrected" original drawing(s) shall be provided to the
city.
   B.   "As built" plans shall include a certification thereon signed by the
registered professional engineer in charge of the work, that the "as built"
drawings are true and correct and that he/she (the registered professional
engineer) has inspected the construction of the sewer main installation and
that the material and installation of same were all done in conformity with the
standard specifications for the construction of sanitary sewers. (Ord. 2004-
1 §1, 2003)
13.12.380: SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   The owner or developer of any piece of property or tract of land is
responsible for the construction of the sewer lines (or for the sewer line
costs) along any property sides or frontages of the property along which a
sewer line is needed for the overall completeness and continuity of the city's
sewer main system. If it is a large tract of land, the owner or developer shall
also be responsible for the necessary and required system of sewer line within
the interior of the tract of land. The owner or developer of any piece of
property shall construct all needed sewer lines of the approved size within and
along all sides or frontages of any piece of property prior to the time any
building construction thereon is occupied or utilized unless "phased"
construction of the sewer main system is specifically allowed or provided for
in the annexation or development agreement.
   B.   The owner or developer of any property or subdivision will normally be
responsible only for the cost of up to an eight inch (8") diameter sanitary
sewer line. The additional cost of providing a sanitary sewer line of a size
greater than eight inches (8") will normally be a city responsibility. The city
will reimburse the developer for the extra cost of the additional sanitary
sewer line size (over the 8 inch diameter size referenced above) as set forth
in the annexation or development agreement between the developer and the city.
Provided further, however, that if any proposed subdivision or development is
of such size or magnitude that it requires or necessitates a sewer size larger
than an eight inch (8") diameter line or if the type of development is such as
to produce a wastewater flow in excess of the capacity of an eight inch (8")
diameter sewer line, then the owner or developer of said subdivision shall be
responsible for the entire cost to whatever size of sewer line is needed to
accommodate his or her development. The additional cost of providing any extra
sewer line depth required by the city (over and above the sewer line depth
required to adequately serve the owner's or developer's property when assuming
at least a 12 foot sewer line depth at the uppermost end of the sewer line
extended through or along said property) will be a city responsibility and the
city will reimburse the owner or developer for the cost of said extra depth of
sewer line as agreed upon and as set forth in the annexation or development
agreement between the developer and the city. (Ord. 2004-1 §1, 2003)
13.12.390: SEWAGE LIFT STATIONS:
Sewer mains shall be kept as deep as practicable to keep sewage lift stations
to the smallest number possible. When a sewage lift station and its related
facilities are required, it and the sewer main system to which it is directing
sewage shall generally be designed for an entire definable area and not just to
serve a single property owner or developer. The cost of the sewage lift station
shall be equitably divided between the developer and the city as set forth in

15.24.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Idaho has delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 1-81 §1.1, 1981)
15.24.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1-81 §1.2, 1981)
15.24.030: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain in a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1-81 §1.3, 1981)
15.24.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 1-81 §1.4, 1981)
15.24.050: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. (Ord. 1-81 §3.3, 1981)
15.24.060: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 1-81 §3.5, 1981)
15.24.070: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of city. (Ord. 1-81 §3.1, 1981)
15.24.080: ADOPTION OF FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration in its flood hazard boundary map (FHBM), and any revision
thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 1-81 §3.2, 1981)
15.24.090: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever this chapter and another
ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1-81
§3.4, 1981)
15.24.100: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder. (Ord. 1-81 §3.6, 1981)

interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the
areas of special flood hazards; for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. (Ord. 1-81
§4.3, 1981)
15.24.150: VARIANCES; APPEAL BOARD:
   A.   The city council as established by law shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the city
clerk in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the city council or its designee, or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the district court, as provided by
law.
   D.   In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations, for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   E.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the provisions of subsection D of this section
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2)
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

forth in the remainder of this section.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   C.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford relief.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in subsection
15.24.150D of this chapter, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   E.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation. (Ord. 1-81 §4.4-2, 1981)

15.28.140: IDAHO STATUTE CLANDESTINE DRUG LABORATORY CLEANUP ACT:
The city of Kamiah adopts the state of Idaho clandestine drug laboratory
cleanup act.
   A.   Purpose: The legislature finds that some residential properties are
being contaminated with hazardous chemical residues created by the manufacture
of clandestine drugs. Innocent members of the public may be harmed when they
are exposed to chemical residues if the residential properties are not
decontaminated prior to any subsequent rental, sale or use of the properties.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare
by authorizing the department of health and welfare to establish a program
providing a process and standards for the cleanup of clandestine drug
laboratories.
   B.   Definitions: As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise
requires:
   CLANDESTINE DRUG LABORATORY: The areas where controlled substances or their
immediate precursors, as those terms are defined in section 37-2701, Idaho
Code, have been, or were attempted to be, manufactured, processed, cooked,
disposed of or stored, and all proximate areas that are likely to be
contaminated as a result of such manufacturing, processing, cooking, disposing
or storing.
   DEPARTMENT: The Idaho department of health and welfare.
   LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY: Any policing agency of the state or of any political
subdivision of the state.
   RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY: Any building or structure to be primarily occupied by
people, either as a dwelling or as a business, including a storage facility,
mobile home, manufactured home or recreational vehicle that may be sold, leased
or rented for any length of time. "Residential property" does not include any
water system, sewer system, land or water outside of a building or structure.
   RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OWNER: The person holding record title to "residential
property", as defined in this section.
   C.   Rules: The department shall promulgate rules establishing the
acceptable process and standards for the cleanup of clandestine drug
laboratories. The department shall also promulgate rules establishing a program
for addition to, and removal from, a list of residential properties that housed
a clandestine drug laboratory.
   D.   Law Enforcement Agency: Following the adoption of rules pursuant to
section 6-2604, Idaho Code, and using a format established by the department, a
law enforcement agency, upon locating chemicals, equipment, supplies or
immediate precursors indicative of a clandestine drug laboratory on a
residential property, shall notify the residential property owner and the
department.
   E.   Residential Property Owner Cleanup Responsibility:
      1.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection E2 of this section, and
pursuant to rules adopted as provided in this chapter, upon notification to a
residential property owner by a law enforcement agency that chemicals,
equipment, supplies or immediate precursors indicative of a clandestine drug
laboratory have been located on the owner's residential property, the
residential property owner shall meet the cleanup standards established by the
department. The residential property shall remain vacant from the time the
residential property owner is notified, in accordance with rules adopted as
provided in this chapter, of the clandestine drug laboratory until such time as
the residential property owner has received a certificate issued by the
department evidencing that the cleanup standards have been met.
      2.   A residential property owner may, at his or her option, elect to
demolish the residential property instead of meeting the cleanup standards
established by the department.
   F.   Residential Property Owner Immunity: Once a residential property meets
the cleanup standards established by the department pursuant to rules adopted
as provided in this chapter, the residential property owner and any
representative or agent of the residential property owner shall be immune from
civil actions involving health claims brought by any future owner, renter or
other person who occupies the residential property, and by any neighbor of such
residential property, where the alleged cause of injury or loss is based upon
the use of the residential property for the purposes of a clandestine drug
laboratory, provided however, that such immunity shall not apply to any person

VARIANCES
SECTION:
16.28.010: Purpose
16.28.020: Findings
16.28.010: PURPOSE:
The commission may recommend to the city council as a result of a unique
circumstance such as topographic physical limitations or a planned unit
development a variance from the provisions of this title on a finding that
undue hardship would result from the strict compliance with specific provisions
or requirements of this title or the application of such provision or
requirement is impracticable. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit, but only where strict application of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship or inequity. (Ord. 2000-2 Art. VII §1, 2000)
16.28.020: FINDINGS:
No variance shall be favorably acted upon by the city council unless there is a
finding upon recommendations by the commission, as a result of a public
hearing, that all of the following exist:
   A.   That there are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this title would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable; in such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provisions or
requirements involved;
   B.   That the strict compliance with the requirements of this title would
result in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual
topography, other physical conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that
these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives
of this title;
   C.   That the granting of a specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the
property is situated;
   D.   That such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code.

CHAPTER 16.32
SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION:
16.32.010: Purpose
16.32.020: Floodplains, Subdivisions Within
16.32.030: Hillside Subdivisions
16.32.040: Cemetery Subdivisions
16.32.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to identify various types of developments that
normally pose special concerns. This chapter outlines the plan submittal
requirements and design standards that shall be taken into consideration when
acting on special developments. The provisions of this chapter are in addition
to the plan requirements, design standards, and improvement standards that are
required by previous chapters of this title. (Ord. 2000-2 Art. VIII §1, 2000)
16.32.020: FLOODPLAINS, SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN:
   A.   Flood Areas: For any proposed subdivision that is located within an
area of special flood hazard, the developer shall provide the commission with a
development plan of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will show
and explain at least the following:
      1.   Location of all planned improvements;
      2.   The location of the base flood and the floodway as documented in the
flood insurance rate maps for Lewis County or other such authoritative source;
      3.   The location of the present water channel;
      4.   Any planned rerouting of waterways;
      5.   All major drainageways;
      6.   Areas of known frequent flooding;
      7.   Means of floodproofing buildings; and
      8.   Means of insuring loans for improvements within the floodplain. New
construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within the
floodplain shall comply with the standards and requirements set forth in the
Lewis County flood damage protection ordinance.
   B.   Justification For Development:
      1.   Upon the determination that buildings are planned within the
floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated within the
floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer shall
demonstrate conclusively to the commission that such development will not
present a hazard to life, limb or property and will not have adverse effects on
the safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage channel or the natural
environment.
      2.   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If only
part of the proposed subdivision can be safely developed, the council shall
limit development to that part and shall require that development proceed
consistent with that determination.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that:
         a.   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
         b.   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages; and
         c.   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards. (Ord. 2000-2 Art. VIII §2, 2000)
16.32.030: HILLSIDE SUBDIVISIONS:
The provisions of this section shall apply to any development proposal for
properties where any average slope exceeds twelve percent (12%) or where
adverse conditions associated with a slope stability, erosion or sedimentation
are present.

      3.   Tree and shrub masses, grass, wildflowers and topsoil;
      4.   Rock outcroppings;
      5.   Streambeds, draws and drainage swales, especially where tree and
plant formations occur; and
      6.   Characteristic vistas and scenic panoramas.
   B.   Hillside Development Evaluation:
      1.   All development proposals shall take into account and shall be
judged by the way in which land use planning, soil mechanics, engineering
geology, hydrology, civil engineering, environmental and civic design,
architectural and landscape design are applied in hillside areas, including,
but not limited to:
         a.   Planning of development to fit the topography soils, geology,
hydrology and other conditions existing on the proposed site;
         b.   Orientation of development on the site so that grading and other
site preparation is kept to an absolute minimum;
         c.   Shaping of essential grading to blend with natural landforms and
to minimize the necessity of padding and/or terracing of building sites;
         d.   Division of large tracts into smaller workable units on which
construction can be completed within one construction season so that large
areas are not left bare and exposed during the winter/ spring runoff period;
         e.   Allocation of areas not well suited for development because of
soil, geology or hydrology limitations for open space and recreation uses;
         f.   Minimizing disruption of existing plant and animal life; and
         g.   Consideration of the view from and of the hillside.
Areas having soil, geology or hydrology hazards shall not be developed unless
it is shown that their limitations can be overcome; that the safety, use or
stability of a public way or drainage channel is not jeopardized; and that the
natural environment is not subjected to undue impact.
   C.   Development Plans: The developer shall obtain the following
information:
      1.   Soils Report: For any proposed hillside development a soils report
shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include data
regarding the nature, distribution and strength of existing soils, conclusions
and recommendations covering the adequacy of sites to be developed.
      2.   Geology Report: For any proposed hillside development a geology
report shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include
an adequate description of site geology and an evaluation of the relationship
between the proposed development and the underlying geology and recommendations
for remedial remedies.
      3.   Hydrology Report: For any proposed hillside development a hydrology
report shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include
an adequate description of the hydrology, conclusions and recommendations
regarding the effect of hydrologic conditions on the proposed development, and
opinions and recommendations covering the adequacy of sites to be developed.
      4.   Grading Plan: A preliminary grading plan may be required by the
planning and zoning commission or administrator. When required, the grading
plan shall be submitted with preliminary plat proposal for the following sites
or conditions:
         a.   Average slope of site is twelve percent (12%) or steeper;
         b.   Unstable soil condition;
         c.   Cut or fills adjacent to or encroaching in existing improvements
(canals, roadways, creeks, etc.);
         d.   Site work requiring retaining walls;
            The grading plan will include, but is not limited to, the
following:
            • Topographic lines of existing land;
            • Grading lines for important areas;
            • Proposed drainage channels and related construction;
            • Quantities for cut and fill materials; and
            • Site of borrow or waste material.
      5.   Final Grading Plan: A final grading plan shall be submitted with
each final plat and shall include the following information:
         a.   Limiting dimensions, elevations or finish contours to be achieved
by the grading, including all proposed cut and fill slopes, proposed drainage
channels and related construction.
         b.   Detailed plans and locations of all surface and subsurface
drainage devices, wall, dams, sediment basins, storage reservoirs and other
protective devices to be constructed.
         c.   A schedule showing when each stage of the project will be
completed including the total area of soil surface which is to be disturbed
during each stage together with each estimated starting and completion dates.
In no event shall the existing ("natural") vegetation ground cover be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to grading.

VARIANCES
SECTION:
16A.28.010: Purpose
16A.28.020: Findings
16A.28.010: PURPOSE:
The commission may recommend to the city council as a result of a unique
circumstance such as topographic physical limitations or a planned unit
development a variance from the provisions of this title on a finding that
undue hardship results from the strict compliance with specific provisions or
requirements of this title or the application of such provision or requirement
is impracticable. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience
or profit, but only where strict application of this title would result in
unnecessary hardship or inequity. (Ord. 2001-5 Art. VII §1, 2001)
16A.28.020: FINDINGS:
No variance shall be favorably acted upon by the city council unless there is a
finding upon recommendations by the commission, as a result of a public
hearing, that all of the following exist:
   A.   That there are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this title would
clearly be impracticable or unreasonable; in such cases, the subdivider shall
first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provisions or
requirements involved;
   B.   That the strict compliance with the requirements of this title would
result in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual
topography, other physical conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that
these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives
of this title;
   C.   That the granting of a specified variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the
property is situated;
   D.   That such variance will not violate the provisions of the Idaho Code.
(Ord. 2001-5 Art. VII §2, 2001)
CHAPTER 16A.32
SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION:
16A.32.010: Purpose
16A.32.020: Subdivisions Within Floodplains
16A.32.030: Hillside Subdivisions
16A.32.040: Cemetery Subdivisions
16A.32.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to identify various types of developments that
normally pose special concerns. This chapter outlines the plan submittal
requirements and design standards that shall be taken into consideration when
acting on special developments. The provisions of this chapter are in addition
to the plan requirements, design standards, and improvement standards that are
required by previous chapters of this title. (Ord. 2001-5 Art. VIII §1, 2001)
16A.32.020: SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN FLOODPLAINS:
   A.   Flood Areas: For any proposed subdivision that is located within an
area of special flood hazard, the developer shall provide the commission with a
development plan of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will show
and explain at least the following:
      1.   Location of all planned improvements;
      2.   The location of the base flood and the floodway as documented in the
flood insurance rate maps for Lewis County or other such authoritative source;
      3.   The location of the present water channel;
      4.   Any planned rerouting of waterways;
      5.   All major drainageways;
      6.   Areas of known frequent flooding;
      7.   Means of floodproofing buildings; and
      8.   Means of insuring loans for improvements within the floodplain. New
construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within the
floodplain shall comply with the standards and requirements set forth in the
Kamiah flood damage protection ordinance.
   B.   Justification For Development:
      1.   Upon the determination that buildings are planned within the
floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated within the
floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer shall
demonstrate conclusively to the commission that such development will not
present a hazard to life, limb or property and will not have adverse effects on
the safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage channel or the natural
environment.
      2.   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If only
part of the proposed subdivision can be safely developed, the council shall
limit development to that part and shall require that development proceed
consistent with that determination.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that:
         a.   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
         b.   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages; and
         c.   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards. (Ord. 2001-5 Art. VIII §2, 2001)
16A.32.030: HILLSIDE SUBDIVISIONS:
The provisions of this section shall apply to any development proposal for
properties where any average slope exceeds twelve percent (12%) or where
adverse conditions associated with a slope stability, erosion or sedimentation
are present.

      3.   Tree and shrub masses, grass, wildflowers and topsoil;
      4.   Rock outcroppings;
      5.   Streambeds, draws and drainage swales, especially where tree and
plant formations occur; and
      6.   Characteristic vistas and scenic panoramas.
   B.   Hillside Development Evaluation:
      1.   All development proposals shall take into account and shall be
judged by the way in which land use planning, soil mechanics, engineering
geology, hydrology, civil engineering, environmental and civic design,
architectural and landscape design are applied in hillside areas, including,
but not limited to:
         a.   Planning of development to fit the topography soils, geology,
hydrology and other conditions existing on the proposed site;
         b.   Orientation of development on the site so that grading and other
site preparation is kept to an absolute minimum;
         c.   Shaping of essential grading to blend with natural landforms and
to minimize the necessity of padding and/or terracing of building sites;
         d.   Division of large tracts into smaller workable units on which
construction can be completed within one construction season so that large
areas are not left bare and exposed during the winter/ spring runoff period;
         e.   Allocation of areas not well suited for development because of
soil, geology or hydrology limitations for open space and recreation uses;
         f.   Minimizing disruption of existing plant and animal life; and
         g.   Consideration of the view from and of the hillside.
Areas having soil, geology or hydrology hazards shall not be developed unless
it is shown that their limitations can be overcome; that the safety, use or
stability of a public way or drainage channel is not jeopardized; and that the
natural environment is not subjected to undue impact.
   C.   Development Plans: The developer shall obtain the following
information:
      1.   Soils Report: For any proposed hillside development a soils report
shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include data
regarding the nature, distribution and strength of existing soils, conclusions
and recommendations covering the adequacy of sites to be developed.
      2.   Geology Report: For any proposed hillside development a geology
report shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include
an adequate description of site geology and an evaluation of the relationship
between the proposed development and the underlying geology and recommendations
for remedial remedies.
      3.   Hydrology Report: For any proposed hillside development a hydrology
report shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. This report shall include
an adequate description of the hydrology, conclusions and recommendations
regarding the effect of hydrologic conditions on the proposed development, and
opinions and recommendations covering the adequacy of sites to be developed.

         b.   Unstable soil condition;
         c.   Cut or fills adjacent to or encroaching in existing improvements
(canals, roadways, creeks, etc.);
         d.   Site work requiring retaining walls;
         The grading plan will include, but is not limited to, the following:
            • Topographic lines of existing land;
            • Grading lines for important areas;
            • Proposed drainage channels and related construction;
            • Quantities for cut and fill materials; and
            • Site of borrow or waste material.
      5.   Final Grading Plan: A final grading plan shall be submitted with
each final plat and shall include the following information:
         a.   Limiting dimensions, elevations or finish contours to be achieved
by the grading, including all proposed cut and fill slopes, proposed drainage
channels and related construction.

17.44.020: AIRPORT ZONES:
   A.   Created: In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there
are created and established certain zones for existing and future planned
airport conditions as they apply to a particular airport. These zones include
all the land lying within the primary zones, approach zones, transitional
zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such zones are shown on the Kamiah
municipal airport hazard zoning map consisting of one sheet prepared by J-U-
B Engineers, Inc., and dated January 1977, which is attached to the ordinance
codified herein and made part hereof. Whenever the zoning map shows zones for
future planned airport improvements, the more stringent future planned zones
govern. Their limitations and boundaries shall be adapted for present zoning
purposes.
   B.   Airport Zones Enumerated: The various zones are established and defined
as follows:
      1.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zones: Utility runway visual approach
zones are established as the area beneath the approach surfaces. The inner edge
of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
two hundred fifty feet (250') wide. The approach zones expand outward uniformly
to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a horizontal
distance of five thousand feet (5,000') from the primary surface, its
centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
      2.   Transitional Zones: Transitional zones are established as the area
beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at
ninety degree (90°) angles to the runway centerline and the centerline extended
at a slope of seven feet (7') horizontally for each foot vertically from the
sides of the primary approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal
surface.
      3.   Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is established as the area
below the horizontal surface. The horizontal zone perimeter is constructed by
swinging arcs of five thousand foot (5,000') radii from the center of each end
of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by the
drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the
approach transitional zones.
      4.   Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area below the
conical surface. The conical zone is the area that commences at the periphery
of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of
four thousand feet (4,000'). (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.44.030: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
   A.   Compliance With Established Limits: Except as provided in this chapter,
no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be
maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the
applicable height limit established in this section for such zone. Such
applicable height limitations are established for each of the zones in question
as set forth in this section.
   B.   Zones:
      1.   Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: In the utility runway visual
approach zone height limitation slopes upward horizontally twenty feet (20')
for each foot vertically, beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as
the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand
feet (5,000') along the extended runway centerline.
      2.   Transitional Zones: In transitional zones height limitation slopes
upward and outward seven thousand feet (7,000') horizontally for each foot
vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred
fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation which is one thousand two hundred
six feet (1,206') above mean sea level.
      3.   Horizontal Zone: In the horizontal zone height limitation is one
hundred fifty feet (150') above the airport elevation or a height of one
thousand three hundred fifty six feet (1,356') above mean sea level.
      4.   Conical Zone: In the conical zone height limitation slopes upward
and outward twenty feet (20') horizontally for each foot vertically beginning
at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at one hundred fifty feet (150')
above the airport elevation and extending to the height of three hundred fifty
feet (350') above the airport elevation.
   C.   Excepted Height Limitations:
      1.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to
thirty feet (30') above the surface of the land.
      2.   Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the
more restrictive limitation shall prevail. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.44.040: USE RESTRICTIONS AND NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Use Restrictions: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this chapter
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals
or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the
eyes of the pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing,
takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
   B.   Nonconforming Uses; Regulations Not Retroactive: The regulations
prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing in this chapter
shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of
any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date hereof, and is diligently prosecuted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses; Marking And Lighting: Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection B of this section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation,
operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be
deemed necessary by the city planning commission chairman to indicate to the
operators of any aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the city of Kamiah, Idaho. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.44.050: PERMITS:
   A.   Future Uses:
      1.   No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure
or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any
zone created by this chapter unless a permit therefor shall have been applied
for and granted.
      2.   However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy five
feet (75') of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the
horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a
horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred feet (4,200') from each end of
the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for the respective zone.
      3.   Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the
resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such a determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted.
   B.   Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date hereof or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the city planning
commission determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned
or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to
exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations.
   D.   Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the
city planning commission for a variance from such regulations. Such variances
shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit
of this chapter.
   E.   Hazard Marking And Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if
such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and
be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner
of the structure or tree in question to permit the city of Kamiah, at its own
expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as
may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of airport hazard. (Ord.

17.56.070: Exemptions
17.56.080: Abandonment
17.56.090: Obsolescence And Removal
17.56.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process, rules and standards for
the construction of wireless telecommunication facilities to:
   A.   Protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   Provide guidelines for the siting and design of wireless communication
facilities.
   C.   Protect the city's environmental resources and to minimize adverse
impacts on visual resources.
   D.   Ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are compatible with
adjacent land uses.
   E.   Minimize the number of towers by encouraging the joint use
(collocation) of facilities and by maximizing the use of existing towers and
structures.
   F.   Allow competition in telecommunication service.
   G.   Enhance the ability to provide wireless telecommunication services to
city residents, businesses and visitors. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.56.020: WHERE ALLOWED:
Wireless telecommunication facilities require the granting of a conditional use
permit by the planning and zoning commission except as specified in section
17.56.070 of this chapter. Facilities are allowed in the industrial (M) zone
but are also permitted with a conditional use permit in the C-2 zone when not
in the designated scenic corridor of U.S. Highway 12. Facilities are not
permitted in the residential (R) or commercial (C-1) zones. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.56.030: PREFERRED FACILITIES:
Site location and development of wireless communication facilities shall
preserve the existing character of the surrounding land uses and buildings and
the aesthetic visual character of the area. If technically feasible, new
facilities shall use the most preferred facility type. The order of preference
for new facilities is as follows (from most preferred to least preferred):
   A.   Collocation on an existing tower.
   B.   Antennas attached to existing structures such as buildings, light
poles, utility poles.
   C.   Concealed or camouflaged facilities.
   D.   New towers/facilities under one hundred feet (100') in industrial
zones.
   E.   New towers/facilities one hundred feet (100') to one hundred seventy
five feet (175') in industrial zones.
New facilities shall use the most preferred type and location where technically
feasible, even if it results in an increase in the number of facilities or a
higher cost. A lesser preferred facility type may be permitted only if the
applicant presents substantial evidence to show that it will have a lesser
visual impact or is more technically necessary than the use of more preferred
facilities. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.56.040: DISFAVORED FACILITIES:
   A.   Any site that is within a state or federal designated scenic corridor
such as U.S. Highway 12.
   B.   Any site within a visual corridor or scenic vista, for example, in or
along a ridgeline exposed to view from highway travelers or to residential
areas, along a public trail, in a park or recreation area, unless the facility
blends with the surrounding natural or manmade environment.
   C.   Sites adjacent to or very close to residential areas.
   D.   Sites adjacent to or very close to sacred sites. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
17.56.050: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Height: New facilities shall not exceed one hundred ninety nine feet
(199') in height.
   B.   Setbacks: The setback for towers is one hundred five percent (105%) of
the tower height from all property lines so that in case of collapse or failure
the tower would be contained on the property. Setbacks may be allowed to extend
onto adjacent properties if there are dedicated fall zone easements. The
setbacks may be reduced if a registered engineer can certify that in case of
failure the tower would be contained on site. In commercial and industrial
zones, the setbacks may be reduced to thirty percent (30%) of the tower height
if a registered engineer can prove that in case of failure the tower would be
contained on site. Guys and accessory buildings must meet the setbacks of the
underlying zoning classification. Facilities that are located on new or
replaced utility poles, streetlights, or traffic signal poles are exempt from
setback requirements.
   C.   Color And Materials: Towers and attached antennas must be painted or
coated in a color that blends with the surrounding environment. Muted colors,
earth tones and subdued hues such as gray shall be used. All associated
structures such as equipment and buildings, including the roofs, shall be
painted the earth tone colors.
   D.   Fencing: New towers, other than flagpoles, utility poles, or other
camouflaged facilities, shall be fenced to prevent trespass.
   E.   Lighting: Lighting on any new tower is prohibited unless required by
the federal aviation administration or by other applicable state or federal
requirements. Motion detector security lighting may be approved if the lights
are fully shielded. Any outdoor lighting requires a separate lighting permit.
   F.   Landscaping: Perimeter landscaping may be required as a condition of
approval of the facility, depending on the location. Existing vegetation shall
be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
   G.   Signs: No advertising is permitted anywhere upon or attached to the
facility. Signage is limited to two (2) small nonilluminated warning and
identification signs not to exceed four (4) square feet in area.
   H.   Permits: A building permit is required for the construction of any new
tower and for accessory structures.
   I.   Storage: Long term vehicle storage and other outdoor storage are
prohibited.
   J.   Term Of Use Permit: The conditional use permit shall have a time limit
of no more than a five (5) year period; the applicant and/or structure owner
shall be responsible for submitting a new application for renewal. The
applicant shall demonstrate that changes in technology have not eliminated the
need for the facility as approved. Renewal of the conditional use permit shall
be based on compliance with the conditions of approval. (Ord. 2007-4, 2007)
