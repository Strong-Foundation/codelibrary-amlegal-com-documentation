      1.   All ordinances of the City shall be typewritten or printed and
presented to the City Council by a member at any regular or special meeting.
Every such ordinance shall be read at the meetings of the Council on three (3)
different days. At each reading, it shall be open to discussion and amendment
or may be referred to a committee unless by majority vote other disposition is
made. All ordinances which have been amended shall, after the second reading,
be engrossed by the City Clerk as amended. On final passage, the yeas and nays
shall be called and recorded and a concurrence of a majority of the full
Council shall be required for passage.
      2.   Provided, however, that on the vote of one-half (1/2) plus one (1)
members of the Council, the Council may dispense with the portion of this
subsection requiring all ordinances to be read on three (3) different days; and
on the vote upon the motion to dispense with this rule, the yeas and nays shall
be called and recorded.
      3.   When any such ordinance is passed, it shall be signed by the Clerk,
and the date of its passage by the Council shall be added thereto, and it
shall, within three (3) days thereafter, be presented to the Mayor, or, in case
of his absence from the City, to the President of the Council for his approval.
If he approves the same, he shall attach his signature thereto.
   B.   Veto By Mayor; Reconsideration By Council:
      1.   Should the Mayor not approve the ordinance, the Mayor shall, before
the next regular meeting after such ordinance is presented to him for his
approval, return the ordinance to the Council with his objections in writing.
When any ordinance is so returned by the Mayor, it shall be reconsidered by the
Council at the first regular meeting thereafter. If, on such reconsideration,
one-half (1/2) plus one (1) of the members of the full Council shall vote in
the affirmative, the ordinance shall become a law notwithstanding the Mayor's
veto. The Clerk, in such cases, shall annex a certificate to the ordinance
stating the same was vetoed by the Mayor, and that, on its reconsideration, it
received the required majority of votes.
      2.   Should the Mayor refuse or neglect to sign such ordinance and return
the same with his objections in writing at the next regular meeting after the
same has been presented to him, it shall become law without his signature. The
Clerk shall annex to such ordinance a certificate to the effect that the Mayor
has failed to sign or veto the same, and it has therefor become a law without
his signature.
   C.   Clerk To Maintain Ordinances: It shall be the duty of the City Clerk to
safely keep the original ordinances as engrossed, and, after final passage, the
Clerk shall copy the same at length in a book to be known as the "Ordinance
Book of Athol", which book shall be provided by the Council for that purpose
and shall be kept as a permanent record of the City. (Ord. 113, 9-3-1967)

ANNEXATIONS
SECTION:
1-10-1: Application
1-10-2: Pre-Annexation Studies
1-10-3: Annexation Procedure
1-10-1: APPLICATION:
Any person desiring to request annexation of lands within his or her ownership
may initiate the annexation consideration process by submitting a completed
annexation request form to the City Clerk accompanied by the filing fee
established by resolution of the City Council. Upon receipt of such completed
form, a report prepared by City staff will be submitted to the Mayor and the
City Council for deliberation concerning the desirability of considering
annexation of the requested lands. Upon receipt of such report, the City
Council, in consultation with City staff, shall decide whether it wishes to
further consider annexation of the requested lands or not. In the course of
such consideration, the City Council may determine what analysis and study it
would require to properly evaluate the consequences and effects of the proposed
annexation. The City Council may, if it wishes to further consider the matter,
establish the necessary prepaid annexation processing fee to be remitted by the
requester if he desires to proceed with the request. Such prepaid fees may
include a standard administrative fee (reasonably related to the administrative
costs of processing an annexation request, including staff and legal expense)
established by resolution of the City Council, in addition to any study based
fees established after City Council consideration of the specific annexation
request. (Ord. 410, 1-17-2017)
1-10-2: PRE-ANNEXATION STUDIES:
The City Council may require the completion of relevant studies before allowing
an annexation proposal to go forward for initial public hearing. Any studies
required by the City Council as a prerequisite to consideration of an
annexation request shall be conducted by City staff or by a consultant chosen
and engaged by the City. The estimated costs of such studies shall be prepaid
by the annexation applicant before the studies are undertaken. Any consultant
engaged to perform specified tasks in the course of evaluating the consequences
of a possible annexation shall serve the City of Athol as its client, not the
parties requesting annexation. Any such studies shall be conducted in
accordance with direction from the City to determine the anticipated
consequences of the proposed annexation. Such studies shall become public
documents upon their completion and shall be made available to the applicant
and other interested parties prior to the conduct of any deliberations. (Ord.
410, 1-17-2017)
1-10-3: ANNEXATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   Upon completion of the required preannexation studies and payment of
requisite fees, the City Clerk shall schedule any authorized annexation
proposal for a public hearing before the City Council as soon as such request
may be accommodated by the Council schedule. No such hearing shall be scheduled
until the required preannexation studies have been received unless the City
Council waives such requirement. The legal purpose of such public hearing shall
be to receive public comment and determine proper zoning or land use
regulations for the lands in question. The public hearing concerning zoning in
anticipation of annexation shall be conducted as a quasi-judicial public
hearing with published notice as required by Idaho Code 50-222 as it now exists
or as subsequently amended.
   B.   Upon completion of the public hearing concerning zoning, and after
considering such other relevant information as it chooses to rely upon, the
City Council may decide to enact an ordinance annexing the subject lands, or
any parts thereof, and establish the zoning designation therefor. All fees and
expenses required to be paid must have been received and an annexation
agreement must have been executed and performed to the extent required by the
City Council prior to passage of the annexation ordinance. (Ord. 410, 1-17-

KENNEL: A place where four (4) or more adult dogs or cats, or any combination
thereof, are kept or boarded. An adult dog or cat shall be construed to mean an

   A.   Purpose: It shall be the purpose of this section to provide standards
and procedures for the care and ownership of certain domestic animals within
the incorporated areas of the City. This section does not address all aspects
of animal ownership, rather it establishes some minimum standards for animal
care, control and treatment for public safety and animal welfare; the
responsibility for actions and behavior of domestic animals remains with the
owner. For purposes of this chapter, all species of animals shall be classified
as either a large animal or a small animal in keeping with the definitions of
section
4-3-1. Any codes not covered in this code shall be required to follow the codes
of Kootenai County with respect to procedures for animal care and impoundment.
   B.   Requirements For Keeping:
      1.   It shall be unlawful for any person within the limits of the City on
a parcel of less than one acre in size to maintain any horse, cow, bull, or any
other large animals as defined herein. The number of animals shall be limited
as outlined in subsection C of this section.
      2.   On parcels over one acre, the following requirements shall be in
force:
         a.   All excreta from the animal shall be removed daily from any
building or shelter where the animal is kept, or from any yard or enclosure
where the animal is permitted. This excreta shall be buried in the ground or
placed in a covered container. Subsequent and final disposal thereof, if made
in the City, shall be done by burying the same in the ground.
         b.   No large animals shall be kept or permitted in any building,
shelter, yard enclosure or pasture, unless the parcel is a minimum size of one
acre and is at least one hundred fifty feet (150') from any residence, street
or highway in the City, except the residence of the owner.
      3.   It shall be unlawful for the owner or custodian of any animal to
refuse or fail to provide such animal with sufficient wholesome and nutritious
food, water, veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering, humane care and
treatment, or to unnecessarily expose any such animal to intolerably hot,
stormy, cold or inclement weather without adequate shelter.
      4.   No owner or custodian of any animal shall abandon such animal on any
street, road, highway or public place, or on private property when not in the
care of another responsible person. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
animal to fail to keep such animal under restraint or permit such animal to run
at large upon the streets and public ways of the city or upon private property
without consent of the owner or present occupant. It shall be prima facie
evidence of a violation of this section when an animal is found by an animal
safety officer or police officer while it is away from its owner (or
responsible person).
      5.   If a person feeds or harbors any animal, they shall be considered an
owner or custodian for purposes of this chapter.
      6.   Every owner and custodian of animals shall be responsible for any
damage done by their animals to another person's property.
   C.   Keeping Of Exotic Or Wild Animals: It shall be unlawful for anyone to
own, harbor, or permit at large any wild or exotic animal without the express
written authorization of the Athol City Council. Such authorization may be
given only if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that the
animal will not constitute a threat to public health or safety. The City
Council may conduct a public hearing to obtain the opinions of adjoining
residents and property owners when considering such requests. The City Council
may charge an applicant for such authorization an appropriate fee to recover
the authorization processing costs incurred by the City.
   D.   Animal Intensity: The following animal intensity limits shall apply:
      1.   Large animals - One large animal per acre of total parcel area.
      2.   Small animals - One small animal or fowl for each two thousand
(2,000) square feet of parcel area.
   E.   Remedy For Violation: Any person who violates any provision of this
section may be subject to civil remedy, as necessary, to assure compliance with
this section. Cost of this remedy shall be defrayed by the owner of the animal.
(Ord. 416, 3-21-2018; amd. Ord. 430, 11-17-2020)

      2.   Any animal constituting a public nuisance or considered a danger to

impounded or destroyed;

situations where the owner is deceased, has been arrested or has been evicted
from his regular place of residence;
      10.   Any animal that has been declared vicious and the owner or harborer
fails to adhere the established guidelines set forth in section
4-3-2 of this title.
   B.   An animal safety officer or police officer may also, or in lieu of
impoundment of a cat or dog running at large, issue to the owner a notice of
violation which calls for payment of an animal control fee or, in the
alternative, may issue a uniform citation charging the owner with a criminal
violation of this chapter. The animal safety officer or police officer may
issue a uniform citation or refer the matter to the city prosecutor in order to
initiate misdemeanor criminal proceedings for the underlying violation of this
chapter. Such citation or complaint shall be punishable as a criminal
misdemeanor as otherwise provided by this code. (Ord. 430, 11-17-2020)

is to protect the public health by the control and prevention of actual and
potential cross connections by requiring the proper installation and
safeguarding of service lines leading to premises where cross connections exist
or are likely to occur, by periodic inspection and by regulating plumbing
within premises or to the public water system itself. An additional purpose is
to provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection
control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water delivered by the city water system. (Ord. 257,
3-2-2004)
6-2A-2: APPLICABILITY:
This article applies throughout the city to every premises and the owners and
occupants thereof served by the water system of the city. It applies to all
systems installed prior to or after its enactment. Every owner and occupant of
any premises covered by this article is responsible for compliance with its
terms and shall be strictly liable for all damage incurred as a result of
failure to comply with the express terms and provisions contained herein. The
water operator will administer the provisions of this article. Any deviation,
modification, or changes from approved standards must be approved by the city
water operator. (Ord. 257, 3-2-2004)
6-2A-3: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section:
AIR GAP (AG) SEPARATION: The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the
receptacle, and must be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case may the
gap be less than one inch (1").
AUXILIARY SUPPLY: Any water source or system other than the city of Athol water
system that may be available in the building or on the premises.
BACKFLOW: The flow other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign
liquids, gases, or substances into the distribution of the public water system.
Back Pressure: Backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or other means
that could create pressure within the system greater than the potable water
supply system.
Back Siphonage: A form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure
within the water system.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly to counteract back pressures or
prevent back siphonage.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical arrangement whereby a public water system is
connected, directly or indirectly, with any other nonportable water system,
sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other
device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage, or other
waste liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting
contamination to the public water system as a result of backflow. Bypass
arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover
devices, or other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of
which, backflow may occur, are considered to be cross connections.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA): An assembly composed of two (2) single,
independently acting check valves, including resilient seated, tightly closing
shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and equipped with properly
located resilient seated test cocks for testing the water tightness of each
check valve.
PRESSURE VACUUM BREAKER BACK SIPHONAGE PREVENTION ASSEMBLY (PVBA): An assembly
containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an
independently operating internally loaded air inlet valve located on the
discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly
located resilient seated test cocks and tightly closing resilient seated
shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed
to protect against a back siphonage condition only.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY (RPBA): An assembly
incorporating two (2) or more check valves and an automatically operating
differential relief valve located between the two (2) checks, two (2) resilient
seated shutoff valves, one located at each end of the assembly and equipped
with properly located resilient seated test cocks for testing. The assembly
must operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check
valves, less than the pressure on the public water system side of the assembly.
At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves must be less
than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve must operate to maintain the reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere thereby providing an atmospheric zone between the
two (2) check valves. (Ord. 257, 3-2-2004)
6-2A-4: CROSS CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED:
   A.   All cross connections, whether or not they are controlled by automatic
devices such as check valves or by hand operated mechanisms such as gate valves
or stop cock, are prohibited.
   B.   Any reinjection of water by individual, commercial, or industrial uses
to the public water system is specifically prohibited. Water-to-water and
water-to-air heat exchangers are considered a cross connection because of
health risks. Any modifications allowing reinjection are prohibited.
   C.   Failure on the part of persons, firms or corporations to discontinue
the use of all cross connections is sufficient cause for the immediate
discontinuance of public water service to the premises. (Ord. 257, 3-2-2004)
6-2A-5: INSTALLATION OF BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLIES:

6-3-12: VIOLATIONS; REVOCATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   Franchise Violations: Whenever the grantor believes that the grantee
has allegedly violated one or more terms, conditions or provisions of this
franchise, a written notice shall be given to the grantee. The written notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the alleged violation so as to afford the
grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee shall have thirty
(30) days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to either correct the
violation or, if the violation cannot be corrected within the thirty (30) day
period, to have commenced and be diligently pursuing corrective action. The
grantee may, within ten (10) business days of receipt of notice, notify the
grantor that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in
fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the grantor shall specify with
particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the running of
the above described time.
      1.   The grantor shall hear the grantee's dispute at a regularly or
specially scheduled meeting. The grantee shall have the right to subpoena and
cross examine witnesses. The grantor shall determine if the grantee has
committed a violation and shall make written findings of fact relative to its
determination. If a violation is found, the grantee may petition for
reconsideration.
      2.   If, after hearing the dispute, the claim is upheld by the grantor,
the grantee shall have thirty (30) business days from such a determination to
remedy the violation or failure.
The time for the grantee to correct any alleged violation shall be extended by
the grantor if the necessary action to correct the alleged violation is of such
a nature or character to require more than thirty (30) days within which to
perform, provided the grantee commences the corrective action within the thirty
(30) day period and thereafter uses reasonable diligence to correct the
violation. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the grantee does not waive any
of its rights under federal law.
   B.   Franchise Revocation: In addition to all other rights which the grantor
has pursuant to law or equity, the grantor reserves the right to revoke,
terminate or cancel this franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining
thereto in accordance with the following procedures and applicable federal law,
in the event that:
      1.   The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts,
or is adjudged as bankrupt and grantee's creditors or trustee in bankruptcy do
not agree to fulfill and be bound by all requirements of this franchise; or
      2.   The grantee violates a material provision of this franchise after
being notified of such violation and being given time to cure or refute the
alleged violation in accordance with subsection A of this section.
   C.   Revocation Procedures: In the event that the grantor determines as set
forth above that the grantee has violated any material provision of the
franchise, the grantor may make a written demand on the grantee that it remedy
such violation and that continued violation may be cause for revocation. If the
violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied within thirty
(30) days following such demand or such other period as is reasonable, the
grantor shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by the grantee is due to acts of God or other causes which result
from circumstances beyond the grantee's control. Such determination shall not
unreasonably be withheld.
      1.   A public hearing shall be held and the grantee shall be provided
with an opportunity to be heard upon fourteen (14) days' written notice to the
grantee of the time and the place of the hearing. The causes for pending
revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such cause shall be recited in
the written notice. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that need
to be shown by the grantor to support a revocation.
      2.   If notice is given and, at the grantee's option, after a full public
proceeding is held, the grantor determines there is a violation, breach,
failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee which is not an event of force
majeure, the grantor shall direct the grantee to correct or remedy the same
within such reasonable additional time, in such manner and upon such reasonable
terms and conditions as the grantor may direct.
      3.   If, after a public hearing, it is determined that the grantee's
performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of
the franchise was prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be
deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result
thereof, provided the grantee has notified the grantor in writing within thirty
(30) days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes
beyond the grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall
include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor
strikes.
      4.   If, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option, a full
public proceeding is held, the grantor determines there was a violation,
breach, failure, refusal or neglect, which is not an event of force majeure,
then the grantor may declare, by resolution, the franchise revoked and canceled
and of no further force and effect unless there is compliance within such
period as the grantor may fix, such period not to be less than thirty (30)
days.
      5.   If the grantor, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option,
a full public proceeding is held and appeal is exhausted, declares the
franchise breached, the parties may pursue their remedies pursuant to franchise
or any other remedy, legal or equitable. The grantee may continue to operate
the system until all legal appeals procedures have been exhausted.
      6.   Notwithstanding the above provisions, the grantee does not waive any
of its rights under federal law or regulation. (Ord. 255, 10-6-2003)
6-3-13: FORECLOSURE, RECEIVERSHIP AND ABANDONMENT:
   A.   Foreclosure: Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the system,

subject to any applicable provisions of state law, including the bankruptcy
act, one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless:
      1.   Within one hundred twenty (120) days after his election or
appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have complied with all the material
provisions of this franchise and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
      2.   Such receiver or trustee, within said one hundred twenty (120) days,
shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having
jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this franchise. (Ord. 255,
10-6-2003)
6-3-14: REMOVAL, TRANSFER AND PURCHASE:
   A.   Removal After Revocation:
      1.   Upon revocation of the franchise, as provided for herein, the
grantee shall proceed to remove, at the grantee's expense, all or any portion
of the system from all streets and public property within the territorial
boundaries of the grantor. In so removing the system, the grantee shall be
responsible for any repairs or damages caused by its removal and shall maintain
insurance during the term of removal.
      2.   If the grantee has failed to commence removal of the system, or such
part thereof as was designated within thirty (30) days after written notice of
the grantor's demand for removal is given, or if the grantee has failed to
complete such removal within one year after written notice of the grantor's
demand for removal is given, the grantee may abandon such system to the
grantor.

the grantor's lawful police powers that do not materially impair or abrogate
any of the grantee's contractual rights under this franchise and that are not
preempted by state or federal law.
   B.   Separability: If any term, condition or provision of this franchise or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be
held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof and the application

those as to whom it shall be held invalid or unenforceable shall not be
affected thereby, and this franchise and all the terms, provisions and
conditions hereof shall, in all other respects, continue to be effective and to
be complied with. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is
subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the
provision which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with
the law, rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon
return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the grantee
and the grantor.
   C.   Administration Of Franchise: This franchise is a contract and, except
as to those changes which are the result of the grantor's exercise of its
police power in management of its rights of way and its generally applicable
regulation of commerce, neither party may take any unilateral action which
materially changes the explicit mutual promises in this contract. Any changes
to the franchise must be made in writing, signed by grantee and grantor.

any cable service through a cable system, unless a franchise authorizing such
use of such street or property or areas has first been obtained.
   E.   Reservation Of Rights: Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
franchise will not constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either
expressly or impliedly, by the grantee of any constitutional or legal right
which it may have or may be determined to have, either by subsequent
legislation or court decisions. The grantor hereby acknowledges that the
grantee reserves all of its rights under applicable federal and state
constitution laws and regulations.
   F.   Force Majeure: With respect to any provision of this franchise chapter,
the violation, or noncompliance with, which could result in the imposition of a
financial penalty, forfeiture or other sanction upon the grantee, such
violation or noncompliance will be excused where such violation or
noncompliance is the result of an inability to secure materials, an act of God,
war, civil disturbance, strike or other labor unrest, or any event beyond the
grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable.
   G.   Captions: The subsection captions and headings in this franchise are
for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

intended structures, the parcel of land, and uses of the buildings and land,
conform in all respects with the applicable provisions of this Code. Whenever
any construction or site work is not in compliance with this title, specific
conditions of approval, or other related laws, ordinances or requirements, the
City may issue a Notice of Violation and order any work stopped by written
notice. Such Notice of Violation or Stop Work Order may be served on any
persons engaged in doing or causing such work to be done, and upon such
service, persons shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the City to
proceed. If no persons are present then the Stop Work Order shall be posted in
a conspicuous location at the site.
   B.   Notice Of Violation: A copy of the Notice of Violation shall be mailed
to the property owner of record and any known holder of any legal interest in
the property, if applicable. The notification shall include:
      1.   The property owner and the legal description of the parcel, as well
as the street address, if any;
      2.   A detailed description of the nature of the violation;
      3.   A description of remedial actions that could be undertaken to
resolve the violation; and
      4.   The length of time allotted to resolve the violation.
The property owner shall have forty five (45) days from the date the Notice of
Violation was mailed to resolve the violation. If resolution does not occur
within those forty five (45) days, the Notice of Violation may be recorded in
the Office of the County Recorder, with a copy mailed to the owner.
   C.   Appeals: The Notice of Violation shall also advise the owner of the
process for appeals of Notices of Violation and Stop Work Orders. An owner or a
holder of any legal interest in the property may appeal a Notice of Violation
or Stop Work Order pursuant to section
1-1-5 of this Code. The appeal shall be heard in accordance with subsection
1-1-5B of this Code. If the appeal is denied (i.e., the action is affirmed),
the City Council shall specify an exact number of days to gain compliance with
this title before the Notice of Violation is recorded, and may add or remove
conditions of remedial action. If the appeal is approved (i.e., the action is
reversed), the City Council shall specify actions to be taken to release the
violation.
   D.   Fees: Prior to or at such time as a violation is resolved, the owner
shall pay the fee specified in the current adopted fee schedule unless the
enforcement action was reversed by the City Council or a court of competent
jurisdiction. Upon payment of such fees or a determination that payment of fees
is not necessary, the City shall cause a Release of Notice of Violation to be
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder. The release shall contain all of
the information contained in the Notice of Violation, as well as the corrective
action taken to resolve the violation. A copy of the release shall be mailed to
the owner.
   E.   Complaints: Any affected person may file a written complaint alleging
that a violation of this Code has occurred. Such complaint, stating fully the
causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the City Clerk. The City shall
investigate the allegations made in the complaint, and, if it appears that
there is reasonable cause to find that the alleged violation did occur, shall
take action thereon as provided in this chapter.
   F.   Penalties: Penalties for failure to comply with or violations of the
provisions of title 7, 8, or 9 of this Code shall be as follows:
      1.   A first violation of any of the provisions of title 7 or 8 of this
Code, or failure to comply with any of their requirements shall constitute an
infraction punishable as set forth in subsection
1-4-1B of this Code.
      2.   A second or subsequent conviction for violation of any of the
provisions of title 7 or 8 of this Code, or failure to comply with any of their
requirements within twelve (12) months of the first violation shall constitute
a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in subsection
1-4-1A of this Code, with a maximum fine of three hundred dollars ($300.00) and
ninety (90) days in jail, per Idaho Code.
      3.   Each day on which a violation continues shall be considered a
separate violation for purposes of both civil and criminal action. The
landowner, tenant, subdivider, builder, or any other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may be found guilty of
a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City Council or
any other public official or private citizen from taking such lawful action as
is necessary to restrain or prevent any violation of title 7 or 8 of this Code,
or of Idaho Code.
      4.   The City Attorney or other attorney who represents the City may also
take civil action in District Court to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate any
action taken, or which may be taken, in violation of title 7 or 8 of this Code,
to vacate any subdivision or condominium plat recorded in violation of title 9
of this Code, or to otherwise enforce the provisions of this Code. In addition
to other actions that may be ordered by the court, if the City prevails, the
violator shall pay to the City all fees associated with the violation then due
and owing. The City may also seek the imposition of a civil penalty in an
amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day,
with a total maximum civil penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).

this Code. Withholding of permits may be appealed in accordance with section
1-1-5 of this Code.

agreements may be used by the city council as a condition of rezoning. Such
conditional zoning development agreements allow a specific project with a
specific use to be developed on property in an area that is appropriately zoned
for proposed uses or conditionally allowed on the subject parcel(s), but which
use and its location may necessitate sensitive treatment in relation to its
setting. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005)
8-5-2: INITIATION OF AGREEMENT:
An agreement may be initiated with the consent of the applicant for the
rezoning of a particular parcel of land or collection of parcels of land
through the following methods:
   A.   By application of the property owner(s); or
   B.   By requirement of the city council. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005)
8-5-3: TIME LIMITS:
All time limits required by state law or local municipal ordinance may be
stayed, modified, or extended upon affirmative vote of the city council. The
council may establish time limits for submittal of an agreement. Failure by the
applicant to comply with such time limit shall be deemed just cause for
termination of conditional zoning development agreement proceedings and denial
of the zone change application. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005)
8-5-4: FORM OF AGREEMENT:
An agreement shall be in the form required by the city council. No agreement
shall be accepted by the city council which does not include the following:

be required.
   G.   Signed letters of application approval, or preapproval, from any
applicable federal, state, county, or local agencies involved in the permitting
process for the specific use proposed. Letters shall include any written

consent to comply with all applicable federal, state, county, and local rules,
regulations, and standards shall be substituted.
   H.   A statement by the owner of the property that failure to comply with
the commitments in the agreement shall be deemed consent to rezone the property

   A.   A conditional zoning development agreement may be approved by the city
council only after the public hearing and notice provisions of Idaho Code
sections 67-6509 and 67-6511 and section
8-4-6 of this title are implemented.
   B.   The city council may add conditions, terms, duties, or obligations to

8-5-9: TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT:
   A.   A conditional zoning development agreement may be terminated by the
city council, without the consent of the breaching party, for failure to comply
with the commitments expressed in the agreement. Such termination shall take
place after a public hearing on the termination, at which time testimony shall
be taken to establish noncompliance with the conditions, terms, obligations, or
duties contained within the agreement. The public hearing shall follow the
notice and hearing provisions of Idaho Code sections 67-6509 and 67-6511 and
section

time to remedy the violation prior to the initiation of termination
proceedings.
   B.   Upon termination of the agreement, the property shall revert to the
zone applicable prior to the adoption of the agreement and its companion
rezoning ordinance (pursuant to a new council resolution terminating the
agreement and a companion ordinance rezoning the property back to its earlier
designation due to the breach of the agreement). All uses of the property which
are not consistent with the subsequently applied zone, following termination of
the agreement, shall cease. The owner of the property may apply for a
conditional use of the parcel, if such use is a conditional use within the
subsequently applied zone. Any conditional zoning development agreement shall
stipulate that costs incurred to rezone the property upon termination of the
agreement be paid by the owner(s) of the property. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005)
8-5-10: ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT:
Development agreements may be enforced by the city council through any means
deemed to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, specific enforcement,

8-6-7: PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE:
When an application for a variance is filed, a public hearing shall be
scheduled before the City Council. The City Clerk- Treasurer shall give notice

the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building, or structure; and

characteristics: the size of the area required for full development of such
uses; traffic and parking incidental to their operation; and/or the effect such
uses may have on adjoining land uses and on the growth and development of the
area in which they are proposed to locate. Since such uses may be suitable only
in specific locations, or only if designed and laid out in a particular manner,

grounds in support of the special (conditional) use permit which the applicant
wishes to make. Such applications and accompanying materials shall be filed
with the city clerk- treasurer.
   A.   The application shall include a review and analysis of the
comprehensive impacts of the proposed special (conditional) use permit.

more specific fashion than those generally required in subsection A of this
section. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005)
8-7-5: FILING FEES:
Filing fees in an amount specified by resolution of the city council shall be
paid upon the filing of each application for a conditional use permit for the

person or entity, the owners of contiguous property within three hundred feet
(300') of that owned by the applicant shall also be notified. The notice
required by this section shall be provided to these property owners/purchasers
of record by first class mail, by the city clerk-treasurer, but at the
applicant's expense. (Ord. 263, 7-12-2005; amd. 2006 Code)

acres for exclusively residential development, and five (5) acres for
developments combining accessory uses with residential use.
      2.   The site shall abut a dedicated public street, and the main street
serving the planned unit development shall be connected to at least one
arterial or collector street as defined in the city's comprehensive plan.
   B.   Minimum Lot Size: The minimum lot size provisions of the residential
(R) zone are waived in a planned unit development, except that such minimum lot
size provisions shall serve as the criterion to determine planned unit
development densities.
   C.   Setback Requirements: Setbacks from front or flanking streets, and
interior or rear property lines in a planned unit development shall all be as
required by the city council.
   D.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking shall be provided in a planned
unit development in the same ratios as required for the types of uses therein
as specified elsewhere in this title.
   E.   Platting Requirements: A planned unit development shall be exempt from
the specific design requirements of the city's subdivision regulations.
However, when any parcel of land in a planned unit development is intended for
individual ownership, sale, or public dedication, the platting procedural
requirements of the city's subdivision ordinance and applicable state laws
pertaining to subdivision of land shall be followed.
   F.   Design Standards:
      1.   Open Space: Open space required shall be as follows:
         a.   Common Open Space: Each planned unit development shall provide
not less than thirty percent (30%) of the gross land area for common open
space, which shall be either:
            (1)   Held in common ownership by all of the owners in the
development area; or
            (2)   Dedicated for public use, if acceptable to the city.
         b.   Private Open Space: Private, usable open space shall be provided
for each dwelling unit in a planned unit development as follows:
            (1)   For single-family structures, detached or attached, private
open space shall be at ground level, and shall be equal to twenty percent (20%)
of the site covered by the dwelling unit, except that in no case shall this
open space be less than two hundred (200) square feet.
            (2)   For dwelling units in multiple residential structures, having
no direct access to ground level, private open space shall be provided in the
following amounts:
               (A)   For dwelling units one story above ground level, an area
(balcony or deck) equal to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross square
footage of the dwelling unit; and
               (B)   For dwelling units two (2) or more stories above ground
level, an area (balcony or deck) equal to a minimum of five percent (5%) of the
gross square footage of the dwelling unit.
      2.   Land Area And Dwelling Unit Computations: Open space and street
areas are computed as follows:
         a.   Street Right Of Way: Streets in a planned unit development shall
be computed at twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area, regardless of the
amount of land actually used for streets in the final design.
         b.   Density And Development Formula: In a planned unit development,
the city council may authorize a dwelling unit density not more than twenty
percent (20%) greater than that permitted by the underlying residential (R)
zone; provided, that the environmental amenities sought by this chapter are
met. Development areas shall be computed according to the following formula:
   G    Is gross land area in square feet
   S    Is street area (i.e., 20 percent of G) in square feet
   C    Is common open space (i.e., 30 percent of G) in square feet
   DU    Is number of dwelling units
   M    Is minimum lot size of underlying residential (R) zone
   N    Is net developable area (G minus S) in square feet
Dwelling units permitted are computed as follows:
DU = N x 1.2 ÷ M
Example of calculations for a three (3) acre site:
G (which is 130,680 square feet) minus S (which is 26,136 square feet) equals N
(which is 104,544 square feet) times 1.2 (which is 125,433 square feet) divided
by M (which is 14,520 square feet) equals DU (which is 8.6 dwelling units)
rounded up to 9 units.
      3.   Maximum Site Coverage: Site coverage shall not be more than that
permitted by the underlying residential (R) zone (i.e., 50 percent) based on
conventional subdivision design.
      4.   Landscaping Required: All common open space shall be landscaped in
accordance with the landscaping and irrigation plan submitted by the applicant
and approved by the city council. Such landscaping shall be maintained by the
homeowners' association, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the
city. In the event that such landscaping and irrigation is not maintained in a
reasonable manner, the city shall have the right to provide for the maintenance
thereof and bill the homeowners' association accordingly. If unpaid, such bill
shall become a lien against the homeowners' association.
      5.   Relationship To Adjacent Areas: The design of a planned unit
development shall take into account the relationship of the site to the
surrounding areas. The perimeter of the planned unit development shall be so
designed as to minimize undesirable impact of the planned unit development on
adjacent properties and, conversely, to minimize undesirable impact of adjacent
land use and development characteristics upon the planned unit development.
      6.   Setback Requirements: Setbacks from the property lines of the
planned unit development shall be comparable to or compatible with those of the
existing development of adjacent properties or, if adjacent properties are
undeveloped, the type of development which may reasonably be expected on such
properties given the existing zoning on such properties or the projections of
the comprehensive plan. In no event shall such perimeter property line setback
be less than ten feet (10').
      7.   Streets: All public streets within or adjacent to a planned unit
development shall meet city standards in force at the time of application.
Article B: Planned Unit Developments In The Commercial (C) Zone:

CHAPTER 14
NONCONFORMING USES, PARCELS AND BUILDINGS
SECTION:
8-14-1: General
8-14-2: Nonconforming Structures
8-14-3: Nonconforming Use Of Structures, Land, Or Structures And Land In
Combination
8-14-4: Nonconforming Parcels Of Land
8-14-1: GENERAL:
Within the City of Athol there exist parcels of land, structures and uses which
were lawful prior to adoption of this title or under previously adopted
ordinances, but which no longer conform to the regulations for the zoning
district in which they are located. It is the intent of this chapter to permit
these nonconformities to continue until they are substantially destroyed,
removed or brought into conformance with this title, providing the
nonconformity is not enlarged or expanded. Nonconformities shall be regulated
according to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 416, 3-21-2018)
8-14-2: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
   A.   Nonconforming structures shall not be expanded or enlarged in a way
that increases the nonconformity. For example, a home that does not meet the
rear setback requirement to the property line may not construct a deck or
addition to any portion of the house that further encroaches into that setback.
An addition may, however, be constructed to the front of the house.
   B.   A nonconforming structure that is completely demolished, removed, or
relocated from the parcel on which it was previously located may be replaced
within twelve (12) months of its demolition, removal, or relocation, provided
that no portion of any replacement structure shall increase the previously
existing nonconformity. Otherwise, any subsequently built structures shall
conform to the provisions of this title.
   C.   Ordinary repairs and additions may be performed on a nonconforming
structure, including but not limited to repair or replacement of the roof,
walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that such work does not increase
the nonconformity. (Ord. 416, 3-21-2018)
8-14-3: NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES, LAND, OR STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION:
   A.   The nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in
combination, shall not be expanded beyond that which lawfully existed on the
effective date of this title or previously adopted applicable ordinances.
Criteria used to determine use and expansion shall include hours of operation,
square footage of structures or area used, traffic generated, volume of goods
handled, number of dwelling units. A nonconforming use shall not be used as
justification for expanding or adding structures or other nonconforming uses.
   B.   Upon written request to, and approval by, the Administrator, a
nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use, providing the
new use would result in the same or greater conformity to this title, and
providing the previous use is permanently abandoned. Nonconforming uses must
progress towards conformity. For example, a nonconforming business that
produces noise and emissions could be replaced by another nonconforming
business that is quieter and does not produce emissions. If a nonconforming use
is replaced with a permitted use, nonconforming uses shall not thereafter be
allowed.
   C.   When any nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months, any subsequent use shall conform to this title.
Nonconforming uses that are discontinued are also governed by the requirements
of section 67-6538, Idaho Code.
   D.   Ordinary repairs and additions may be performed on a structure housing
a nonconforming use, including, without limitation, repair or replacement of
the roof, walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that such work does not
increase the nonconformity.
   E.   A structure housing a nonconforming use that is completely removed may
not be replaced unless the use and structure are in conformance with this
title. (Ord. 416, 3-21-2018)
8-14-4: NONCONFORMING PARCELS OF LAND:
   A.   A parcel of land shall not be modified in any manner that results in it
becoming a nonconforming parcel, or that expands or enlarges an existing
nonconformity, unless the modification resulted from the exercise of eminent
domain.
   B.   Upon written request to, and approval by the Administrator, a
nonconforming parcel may be changed, providing the modification results in the
same or greater conformity with this title. Nonconforming parcels must progress
toward conformity. For example, the lot line of a lot that does not meet the
minimum size could be adjusted to increase the size of the lot, but it could
not be adjusted in a manner that would make the lot smaller. (Ord. 416, 3-21-
2018)

road or a public or improved private right-of-way.
      2.   A boundary line adjustment may add land from an unplatted parcel to
an existing lot or from an existing lot to an unplatted parcel.
      3.   A parcel that is not eligible for development permits because it
does not conform to the applicable provisions of City Code, or was created
improperly, cannot become eligible for development permits solely as a result
of a boundary line adjustment.
      4.   In order to ensure that no additional parcels of land are
inadvertently created, boundary line adjustments should be accomplished by
recordation of a deed of conveyance for the property that is to be transferred,
and then by recordation of a second deed for the receiving parcel which
describes the new, exterior parcel boundaries. A statement should also be
included on the deeds of conveyance which indicates that those instruments are
being recorded for boundary line adjustment purposes, and that no additional
parcels are being created as a result of the adjustment.
   D.   Decedent's Estates: Divisions made pursuant to a will, testamentary
trust, testamentary provision of an inter vivos trust, or other similar
instrument associated with a decedent's estate. The instrument must contain
language providing for the division to be made. Such divisions must comply with
the following requirements:
      1.   Each parcel has legal access to a public road;

(Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-5-4: PROCESSING AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL:
   A.   Procedure for Processing of Applications:
      1.   Site Inspection and Sketch Plan Review: The applicant must provide a
sketch plan, consisting of simple, conceptual drawings which show the layout of
proposed streets and lots. The city planner will review the approval process
with the applicant and will confer with the applicant as to the design and
feasibility of the proposal.
      2.   Existing Code Violations: If any unpermitted site disturbance or
subdivision development has previously occurred (e.g., construction of roads,
driveways, building pads, etc.), a site disturbance permit must be obtained,
and stormwater and erosion control systems and BMPs must be installed and
approved before a subdivision application will be accepted as complete for
purposes of vesting and processing. Any other violations of City Code must also
be corrected prior to application, except to the extent that approval of the
application will remedy any such violation.
      3.   Subdivision Design: The applicant and design consultant will then
lay out the proposed subdivision, and the project surveyor will draw a proposed
preliminary plat. Surveying of lot lines shall not be necessary until after
preliminary approval is granted. Applications for phased subdivisions must
include a proposed completion schedule for each phase, and for the project as a
whole. Each phase of a phased subdivision must include at least ten (10) lots.
      4.   Application: The applicant must then submit a complete application
to the City, including a sufficient number of copies as determined by the
Administrator. The application and proposed plat must meet the requirements of
section
9-5-3. Incomplete applications will not be processed.
      5.   Agency Review:
         a.   If the application is complete, the department will forward it to
other agencies with relevant jurisdiction or expertise with a request for
review and comment within thirty (30) days of receipt. After the agency review
memo and pertinent information have been sent, the applicant should contact
each agency to determine whether there are additional requirements which will
apply to the proposed subdivision. Agency responses should explain whether the
proposal appears feasible and will meet the agency's requirements, any negative
effects that may result from the subdivision and any actions which may be
needed to mitigate those effects and ensure that the development does not
compromise the quality, or increase the cost, of public services and
facilities, any additional information that may be needed, and what is required
or recommended prior to final approval.
         b.   Agencies that may be asked to comment include, but are not
limited to, the fire protection and highway districts with jurisdiction, the
Idaho Transportation Department, the school district, Panhandle Health
District, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the Idaho Department
of Water Resources, water and sewer service providers, utility providers, the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kootenai County, and the Idaho Department of
Lands. In addition to providing general comments, the department will request
that the following agencies address these specific items:
            (1)   Panhandle Health District: The requirements for the lifting
of sanitary restrictions, as may be required prior to recordation.
            (2)   School district: Any measures which may be needed to mitigate
the effect that new students from the subdivision will have on the district, so
that there will be no substantial cost to existing residents.
            (3)   Fire protection district: The minimum required fire flows in
gallons per minute and duration.
         c.   Requests by an agency for actions to be taken, or fees to be
paid, to mitigate impacts of a subdivision should be roughly proportional, both
in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development.
      7.   Scheduling: After all required agency letters are received, the
department will review the application and schedule it for public hearing.
Prior to scheduling, the applicant may make minor changes, but once the
application is scheduled for hearing, the proposal cannot be significantly
modified. If additional information is provided after hearing on the
application has been scheduled, the Administrator may require additional agency
review or additional public notice, or both, and may reschedule or continue the
hearing to allow time for the additional information to be reviewed.
      8.   Staff Report and Recommendation: Prior to the hearing, the
Administrator will prepare a report on the proposal. The report shall include
an evaluation of the proposal's compliance with the applicable provisions of
this title, a recommendation of approval or denial, and the reasons for the
recommendation. If the recommendation is for approval, the report shall include
any recommended conditions of approval.
   B.   Hearing and Decision-Making Process:
      1.   Notice: Notice of all public hearings on applications for
preliminary subdivision approval shall be given in accordance with this
section. Prior to the public hearing, notice thereof shall be published once in
the official newspaper of the City at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. Notice shall be also sent by U.S. mail, postmarked at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the hearing, to all property owners and purchasers of record
whose property is within or adjacent to the area bounded by lines three hundred
feet (300') from the external boundary of the proposal area and any additional
area that may be substantially impacted as determined by the Administrator.
Notice shall also be posted on the subject property not less than seven (7)
days prior to the hearing. All hearing notices shall include the date, time,
and place of the hearing as well as a summary of the proposal, including the
legal description of the property and its general location. It shall be the
responsibility of the Administrator to prepare the notices of public hearing
and publish, mail and post the same.
      2.   Hearing: Hearings on applications shall be conducted by the Council
as a quasi-judicial public hearing.
   C.   Required Findings:
      1.   In making a decision on an application, the City Council shall only
consider the application materials which have been submitted and the relevant
testimony and evidence in the record. The applicant shall bear the burden of
proof (including both the burden of going forward with evidence and the burden
of persuasion) that the application complies with the applicable requirements
of this chapter.
      2.   To recommend preliminary approval of an application, the City
Council must make all of the following findings:
         a.   The applicant has provided information sufficient to determine
whether the application complies with the relevant requirements of this
chapter.
         b.   The application complies with the requirements of section
9-5-3.
         c.   The application complies with, or is capable of complying with,
the requirements of this chapter.
         d.   The plan, project and lots proposed in the application are
capable of complying with all other applicable provisions of City Code without
variances.
         e.   The plan, project and proposed lots are capable of complying with
the requirements of other agencies with jurisdiction or providing services.
         f.   The proposal will contribute to orderly development of the area.
The design, density and proposed uses (including infrastructure facilities such
as wastewater treatment), are compatible with existing homes, businesses,
neighborhoods, and with the natural characteristics of the area. The
subdivision will create lots of reasonable utility and livability, which are
capable of being built upon without imposing an unreasonable burden on future
owners. Areas not suited for development are designated as open space.
         g.   The proposed subdivision will provide adequate open space for
recreation, wildlife, agriculture or timber production where appropriate. Road
construction and disturbance of the terrain, vegetation and drainageways will
be minimized and will not result in soil erosion upon completion. The design
adequately addresses site constraints or hazards and will adequately mitigate
any negative environmental, social or economic impacts.
         h.   Services and facilities such as schools, electricity, water,
wastewater disposal, stormwater management, garbage disposal, EMS, police and
fire protection are feasible, available and adequate. The proposal includes on
and off-site improvements, or payments in lieu of such improvements, to
mitigate the impacts of the subdivision so that it does not unduly compromise
the quality, or increase the cost, of public services. Any request by an agency
for actions to be taken, or fees to be paid, to mitigate impacts of a
subdivision shall not be recommended as a condition of preliminary approval
unless the proposed actions or fees are roughly proportional, both in nature
and extent, to the impact of the proposed development.
         i.   Proposed roads, sidewalks and trails establish or adequately
contribute to a transportation system for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians
that is safe, efficient and that minimizes traffic congestion.
         j.   The proposal is not anticipated to result in significant
degradation of surface or ground water quantity or quality.
         k.   Public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to be
heard on the application have been given in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Idaho Code and this title.
      3.   If the City Council makes all of the required findings set forth in
section, it shall grant preliminary approval of the application. If the
proposal cannot meet one or more of these requirements, or if insufficient
information was provided to make that determination, the City Council shall
deny the application.
      4.   The decision of the Council shall comply with section 67-6535, Idaho
Code, and shall cite the applicable legal standards, state the evidence and
conclusions on which the decision was based, and explain any relevant contested
facts and its evaluation of these facts. If the decision is to approve, it
shall include any recommended conditions of approval.
      5.   Conditions of approval shall be roughly proportional, both in nature
and extent, to the reasonably expected impacts of the proposed development. Any
request by an agency for actions to be taken, or fees to be paid, to mitigate
impacts of a subdivision shall not be required as a condition of preliminary
approval unless the proposed actions or fees are roughly proportional, both in
nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development.
      6.   Preliminary subdivision approval shall be valid for two (2) years.
For subdivisions done in conjunction with a PUD, or that include three (3) or
more phases with a total of fifty (50) or more lots, an alternate completion
schedule may be requested in the preliminary application and may be approved by
the Council. At any time prior to expiration of the approval, the applicant may
make a written request to the Administrator for a single extension of up to two
(2) years, according to the extension process provided in section
9-5-5. For phased developments, one automatic two (2) year extension shall be
granted upon recordation of the plat for the first phase. Subsequent extensions
for phased developments may be requested in accordance with section
9-5-5.
   D.   Reconsiderations and Appeals:
      1.   Reconsideration: Every applicant or affected person seeking judicial
review of the City Council's final decision must first file with the City
Council a written petition for reconsideration of the Council's decision,
specifying deficiencies in the decision for which reconsideration is sought
within fourteen (14) days.
         a.   The City Council may reconsider its decision only if it finds any
of the following:
            (1)   There was a clerical error in the decision;
            (2)   The decision resulted from fraud or mistake;
            (3)   There is newly discovered evidence or a change in
circumstances;
            (4)   There was a procedural error;
            (5)   The Council previously rejected the application by a tie
vote; or
            (6)   The decision was made in violation of substantive law.
         b.   The City Council shall review the petition for reconsideration at
its next regular meeting and decide whether to reconsider the matter. If the
City Council grants reconsideration in whole or in part, a hearing before the
City Council will be scheduled to address the specific deficiencies identified
by the applicant or affected person, which shall be conducted pursuant to the
public notice procedures of this chapter. The issues examined upon
reconsideration shall be limited to issues raised by the petition for
reconsideration and the record previously established, as well as the
applicable law. The cost of all required notices shall be borne by the party
(ies) appealing the decision and paid in advance.
         c.   Following the hearing on the reconsideration, the City Council
may affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, its prior decision and
shall provide a written decision to the applicant and the affected person(s)
within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for reconsideration. If the
City Council fails to timely decide, the request for reconsideration is deemed
denied.
      2.   Judicial Appeals: After a notice of decision is issued, or after a
revised notice of decision is issued under a reconsideration proceeding, any
aggrieved party with standing to appeal, may appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   E.   Construction Approval:
      1.   Preconstruction Plan Approval: After preliminary subdivision
approval is granted, the applicant shall submit construction plans for review
and approval by the City and other agencies with jurisdiction. The City will
review those plans for conformance with the design standards contained in title

plans may include, without limitation, plans for roads, water and sewer
systems, trails, vegetation buffers, and stormwater, erosion and dust control.
No construction, site disturbance or other development activity may commence
until plans are approved and the appropriate development permits are issued by
the City.
      2.   Construction Approval: After construction plans have been approved
and development permits have been issued, the applicant may either install the
improvements, obtain written approval of the construction by the design
professionals and applicable agencies, and apply for final subdivision
approval, or, alternatively, may submit a financial guarantee and subdivision
completion agreement which complies with the requirements of sections
9-7-9 and
9-8-8, and are approved by the Administrator, and then apply for final
subdivision approval. (Ord. 442, - -2023)

      11.   Improvements are either complete and approved by all agencies with
jurisdiction and those providing services, or construction plans have been
approved and a financial guarantee approved by the Administrator and by all
agencies with jurisdiction and those providing services. If an agency is unable
or unwilling to approve a financial guarantee, the Administrator may assume
this authority.
      12.   If any land, shared infrastructure, or improvements will be
privately maintained, documents establishing the maintenance organization have
been approved by the Administrator and are ready to be recorded with the plat.
      13.   For phased projects, the phase for which final approval has been
applied complies with all of the requirements of this title and with those of
other agencies and service providers.
   C.   Recommendation: If the application and the subdivision comply with all
of the requirements of subsection B of this section, the Administrator shall
recommend approval. If the application and the subdivision do not comply with
one or more of these requirements, or if insufficient information was provided
to make that determination, the Administrator shall recommend denial. The
Administrator shall make a recommendation within forty five (45) days of the
receipt of a complete application unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant.
   D.   City Council Decision:
      1. The City Council shall make the final decision on applications for
final subdivision approval. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Administrator, the city clerk shall schedule the application for deliberations
before the council. Deliberations shall be conducted in accordance with the
Idaho open meetings law, title 74, chapter 2, Idaho Code, but the Council shall
not allow public testimony, nor shall it admit additional evidence into the
record.
      2.   After reviewing the evidence in the record and the standards for
approval, the Council shall then take one of the following actions:
         a.   Approve the request;
         b.   Deny the request; or
         c.   Remand the application to the Administrator.
      3.   To grant final approval of an application, the Council must make all
of the findings set forth in subsection B of this section. If the Council makes
all of those findings, it shall grant final approval of the application. If the
proposal cannot meet one or more of those requirements, or if insufficient
information was provided to make that determination, the Council may either
deny the application, remand the application to the Administrator, or schedule
a public hearing to receive additional application materials, testimony and
evidence.
      4.   The order of decision of the Council shall comply with section 67-
6535, Idaho Code, and shall cite the applicable legal standards, state the
evidence and conclusions on which the decision was based, and explain any
relevant contested facts and its evaluation of these facts. The order of
decision shall be issued within thirty five (35) days of the deliberations
where the case was decided unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant. (Ord.
442, - -2023)
9-5-8: RECORDATION OF PLAT:
Within one (1) year of final subdivision approval, the applicant must submit
the mylar plat and any associated documents to the city clerk in a form ready
to record. The applicant must obtain the owner's signature and the health
district signature on the plat, before submittal to the city. All signatures
and stamps must be in reproducible, quick drying, permanent, indelible, black
ink. The Administrator will check for compliance with the final subdivision
approval and will obtain signatures on the plat from the clerk and city
engineer, before returning the plat to the applicant to obtain the remaining
county signatures and record the plat. An extension of the one-year period for
recordation may be requested prior to the expiration of the then current
period, and such requests may be granted by the Administrator. If the plat is
not submitted within one year, and a request for extension is not timely made
and granted by the Administrator, the approval shall be null and void. (Ord.

CONDOMINIUM PLATS
SECTION:
9-6-1: Description And Applicability
9-6-2: Application Requirements
9-6-3: Approval Procedure
9-6-4: Final Approval And Recordation Of Plat
9-6-1: DESCRIPTION AND APPLICABILITY:
The procedure set forth in this chapter shall apply to approval of condominium
plats when the proposed condominium is located on one or more existing lots and
no further division of land on which the proposed condominium is located is
proposed. If the condominium plat does not meet these criteria, it must be
approved as a subdivision. The determination as to whether a proposed
condominium constitutes a division of one or more existing lots shall be within
the discretion of the Administrator, subject to the appeal procedure set forth
in Section
1-1-5 of City Code. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-6-2: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Complete Application Required: The application shall submit one (1)
application packet to the city clerk in electronic format except as may be
approved by the Administrator. The director will determine which agencies are
to receive applications for review and comment, and the department will forward
the application to those agencies. The application shall include the proposed
declaration of condominium, proposed condominium plat, and all materials
required for approval as set forth in section
9-5-3, except as may be waived by the Administrator.
   B.   Fee: At the time of filing a condominium plat application, the
applicant shall pay an application fee to the city as provided in the fee
schedule approved by resolution of the Council.
   C.   Information Required: A proposed condominium plat and declaration of
condominium shall include all information required under title 50, chapter 13,
and title 55, chapter 15, Idaho Code. The form and content of the proposed
condominium plat and supplemental pages shall also comply with the requirements
of section
9-5-3, table B-11, with the exception of final lot lines.
   D.   Compliance With Zoning Regulations:
      1.   The proposed condominium plat shall comply with all applicable
requirements of the underlying zone.
      2.   If the applicant is also applying for approval of a planned unit
development in conjunction with the proposed condominium plat, the standards
for planned unit developments shall apply, as set forth in title 8, chapter 9,
including any modifications of other zoning standards allowed therein.
Applications for approval of a condominium plat associated with a planned unit
development shall be submitted concurrently with the PUD application.
   E.   Processing: No condominium plat application shall be processed until
all maps and information required by this section have been filed, checked and
accepted by the Administrator, and the required fees have been paid.
   F.   Additional Requirements for Phased Condominiums:
      1.   If the condominium project will contain more than one phase, the
condominium plat for the first phase and each subsequent phase must also
include the following information:
         a.   All future buildings or structures planned for the site, showing
appropriate dimensions and locations;
         b.   Identification of the order in which subsequent buildings or
structures will be constructed;
         c.   A statement that each phase will be superseded by the subsequent
phase.
      2.   If the initial condominium plat was required to be approved through
the subdivision or planned unit development approval process, subsequent phases
may be approved under the provisions of this section so long as the plat does
not further divide land and the Administrator determines that the condominium
plat does not significantly deviate from the plat of any previous phase or any
conditions of approval for the initial phase. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-6-3: APPROVAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Procedure for Processing of Applications:
      1.   Site Inspection and Plan Review: The applicant must provide a draft
declaration of condominium and conceptual condominium plat drawing. The
Administrator and applicant will review the approval process with the applicant
and will confer with the applicant as to the design and feasibility of the
proposal.
      2.   Existing Site Disturbances and Code Violations: If any unpermitted
site disturbance or development has previously occurred (e.g., construction of
roads, driveways, building pads), a site disturbance permit must be obtained,
and BMPs must be installed and approved before an application for approval of a
condominium plat will be accepted as complete for purposes of vesting and
processing. The Administrator may require placement or replacement of trees or
other vegetation needed for screening and buffering of the condominium as a
condition of condominium plat approval. Any other violations of this Code must
also be corrected prior to application, except to the extent that approval of
the application will remedy any such violation.
      3.   Condominium Design: The applicant and design consultant will then
lay out the design of the project and, if necessary, will revise the proposed
declaration of condominium, and the project surveyor will draw a proposed
condominium plat. The requirements for design, improvements and maintenance for
condominium plats shall be as set forth in title 9, chapter 7.
      4.   Application: The applicant must then submit a complete application
packet to the city clerk. The application, the proposed declaration and
proposed plat must meet the requirements of section
9-6-2. Incomplete applications will not be processed.
      5.   Agency Review:
         a.   If the application is complete, the Administrator shall review
the application and forward it to other agencies with relevant jurisdiction or
expertise with a request for review and comment within thirty (30) days of
receipt. After the packets have been sent, the applicant should contact each
agency to determine whether there are additional requirements which will apply
to the proposed condominium. Agency responses should explain whether the
proposal appears feasible and will meet the agency's requirements, any negative
effects that may result from the condominium and any actions which may be
needed to mitigate those effects and ensure that the development does not
compromise the quality, or increase the cost, of public services and
facilities, any additional information that may be needed, and what is required
or recommended prior to final approval.
         b.   Agencies that may be asked to comment include, but are not
limited to, the fire protection and highway districts with jurisdiction, the
Idaho Transportation Department, the school district serving the area,
Panhandle Health District, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality,
utility providers, Kootenai County Noxious Weeds Department, Idaho Department
of Lands, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. In addition to providing
general comments, the department will request that the following agencies
address these specific items:
            (1)   Panhandle Health District: The requirements for the lifting
of sanitary restrictions, as required prior to recordation.
            (2)   Sewer provider (if separate from city): A will-serve letter,
and any actions required to secure sewer connections.
         c.   Requests by an agency for actions to be taken, or fees to be
paid, to mitigate impacts of a condominium should be roughly proportional, both
in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development.
      7.   Comment Period: The Administrator shall also schedule the
application for a thirty (30) day public comment period, which shall run
concurrently with the agency comment period. The department shall cause a
notice of comment period to be published in the Coeur d'Alene Press at the
applicant's expense. The Administrator shall also cause notice to be mailed to
all property owners within 300 feet of the subject property and any contiguous
lots or parcels under the same ownership, at the applicant's expense, on or
before the first day of the comment period. Information submitted prior to the
close of the comment period shall be entered into the record on the
application.
   B.   Order of Decision and Required Findings:
      1.   After the close of the comment period, the Administrator shall
review the relevant evidence in the record and the standards for approval and
shall issue an order of decision. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof
(including both the burden of going forward with evidence and the burden of
persuasion) that the application complies with the applicable requirements of
this chapter. To approve a condominium plat, the Administrator must make the
following findings:
         a.   The applicant has provided information sufficient to determine
whether the application complies with the relevant requirements of this
chapter.
         b.   The declaration of condominium meets the relevant requirements of
title 55, chapter 15, Idaho Code.
         c.   The condominium plat meets the relevant requirements of section
9-6-2 of this chapter, title 50, chapter 13, Idaho Code, and title 55, chapter
15, Idaho Code.
         d.   The condominium plat and the project are in compliance with other
applicable provisions of this Code without variances.
         e.   The condominium plat and the project meet the requirements of all
agencies with jurisdiction and those providing services.
         f.   The design and proposed uses are compatible with existing homes,
businesses and neighborhoods, and with the natural characteristics of the area.
The condominium creates individual units and common areas of reasonable utility
and livability, capable of being built upon without imposing an unreasonable
burden on future owners. Areas not suited for development are designated as
common areas of the condominium and as open space.
         g.   Negative environmental, social and economic impacts have been, or
will be mitigated. Driveway construction and disturbance of the terrain,
vegetation and drainageways will be minimized and will not result in soil
erosion. The design adequately addressed site constraints or hazards.
         h.   Services and facilities which will serve the condominium are
available and adequate. On- and off-site improvements, or payments in lieu of
such improvements, that are roughly proportional, both in nature and extent, to
the impact of the proposed development have been made in order to mitigate the
impacts of the condominium so that it does not compromise the quality or
increase the cost of services.
         i.   The sanitary restrictions will be lifted prior to recordation.
         j.   Appropriate documents which establish a condominium owners'
association which will bear responsibility for maintenance of commonly owned
land, infrastructure, or other improvements, have been approved by the
Administrator and are ready to be recorded with the condominium plat.
         k.   Public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to
comment on the application have been given in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Idaho Code and this chapter.
      2.   If the application and the condominium comply with all of the
requirements of subsection B1 of this section, the Administrator shall approve
the application. If the application and the condominium do not comply with one
or more of these requirements, or if insufficient information was provided to
make that determination, the Administrator shall deny the application.
      3.   The order of decision of the Administrator shall comply with section
67-6535, Idaho Code, and shall cite the applicable legal standards, state the
evidence and conclusions on which the decision was based, and explain any
relevant contested facts and its evaluation of these facts. Decisions of
approval shall include any conditions of approval. The order of decision shall
be issued within thirty five (35) days of the close of the comment period
unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant.
      4.   The decision of the Administrator may be appealed in accordance with
the provisions of Section
1-1-5 of this Code. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-6-4: FINAL APPROVAL AND RECORDATION OF PLAT:
Within one (1) year of approval, the applicant must meet any conditions and
submit the mylar plat and any associated documents to the city clerk in a form
ready to record. The applicant must obtain the owner's signature and the health
district signature on the plat, before submittal to the city. All signatures
and stamps must be in reproducible, quick drying, permanent, indelible, black
ink. A current title report, which may be an updated version of the title
report originally submitted with the application, must also be submitted with
the plat. The Administrator will check for compliance with any conditions of
approval and will obtain signatures on the plat from the mayor, clerk and city
engineer, before the plat and any associated documents are returned to the
applicant to seek the remaining signatures. An extension of the one-year period
for recordation may be requested prior to the expiration of the then current
period, and such requests may be granted by the Administrator for good cause
shown. If the plat is not submitted within one year, and a request for
extension is not timely made and granted by the Administrator, the approval
shall be null and void. (Ord. 442, - -2023)

DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS
SECTION:
9-7-1: Purpose
9-7-2: General Design Requirements
9-7-3: Utility And Service Standards
9-7-4: Easements And Rights Of Way
9-7-5: Subdivision And Lot Design
9-7-6: Roads And Trails
9-7-7: Improvement Requirements
9-7-8: Operation And Maintenance Requirements
9-7-9: Financial Guarantees
9-7-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this section is to delineate the minimum on site design
requirements for subdivisions and condominium plats. While off-site
improvements may also be required to mitigate the effects of the development,
these will be considered project by project. For purposes of this chapter, the
term "subdivision" shall include condominiums except where condominiums are
specifically referenced therein. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-2: GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   No land shall be subdivided which the Council finds to be unsuitable
for building sites because of potential hazards, such as flooding, inadequate
drainage, severe erosion potential, site contamination, excessive slope,
rockfall, landslides, subsidence (sinking or settling), high groundwater,
inadequate water supply or sewage disposal capabilities, high voltage power
lines, high pressure gas lines, poor air quality, vehicular traffic hazards, or
any other situation that may be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare
of residents or the public, unless the hazards are eliminated or adequately
mitigated.
   B.   Development of land shall occur in conjunction with services and
facilities that are appropriate for the size and density of the development.
Services and facilities necessary to serve the subdivision must be feasible,
available and adequate, and the proposal must include such on- and off-site
improvements as will mitigate the impacts of the development, so that the
existing quality of services is not compromised and there is no substantial
increase in the cost of services to existing residents. Mitigation of impacts
may include on- and off-site improvements, or payments in lieu of such
improvements, so long as they are authorized by law, are directly related to
the proposed subdivision, and are roughly proportional, both in nature and
extent, to the impacts of the proposed subdivision.
   C.   For lots that will not be used for habitable structures, such as open
space, and unmanned utility lots, the Council may waive any of the requirements
for services and facilities listed in this chapter so long as the public,
agencies, infrastructure, and future lot owners will not be negatively
affected. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-3: UTILITY AND SERVICE STANDARDS:
   A.   Domestic Water Systems:
      1.   Connection to the city's water system shall generally be required,
unless such connection is infeasible and an alternative acceptable to the
Council is proposed.
      2.   The new components of a water system and any necessary improvements
to an existing system must be designed and constructed in conformance with the
current edition of the "Idaho Standards For Public Works Construction" and the
"Supplemental Construction Specifications to the ISPWC and Design Standards"
adopted by the City of Athol, the requirements of DEQ, the fire protection
district with jurisdiction, and if applicable, the water district, utility or
corporation which will be providing service. Distribution lines shall be
installed to each lot.
   B.   Fire Protection Systems: Subdivisions shall comply with the applicable
requirements of the fire protection district with jurisdiction, including those
pertaining to roads, driveways, fire flows, hydrants, water storage and
defensible space. In addition, each lot shall have a building site capable of
being accessed by a driveway which complies with the standards of the fire
protection district.
   C.   Sewage Disposal Systems: If a public sewage system is available and
provides a "will serve" letter, connection shall be required. If a private,
shared sewage system is available and provides a "will serve" letter,
connection may be required, providing the cost of service is commensurate with
that charged to existing customers. If connection to a shared system is
required, collection lines shall be installed to each lot. All sewage disposal
systems shall meet the standards of the Panhandle Health District and/or DEQ,
the current edition of the "Idaho Standards For Public Works Construction" and
the "Supplemental Construction Specifications to the ISPWC and Design
Standards" adopted by the City of Athol. If required, shared sewage systems
shall be installed and approved, or the necessary improvements secured by a
financial guarantee, prior to final approval of the subdivision. Individual
septic systems may be installed after final subdivision approval, in
conjunction with individual site development.
   D.   Underground Utility Placement: Underground installation of utilities
shall be required unless utility providers determine that site conditions would
preclude or would render such installation impractical or cost prohibitive,
taking into consideration such factors as terrain, available easements, safety,
maintenance, repair, replacement and the like.
   E.   Stormwater Management: Lots shall be laid out to provide drainage away
from building sites. Infiltration of stormwater in small quantities is
preferred. The collection and concentration of stormwater in detention and
retention basins, wet ponds, constructed wetlands or similar facilities is
discouraged and shall only be allowed when there is no feasible alternative.
Discharge of untreated stormwater into streams, lakes, natural wetlands or
groundwater is prohibited.
   F.   Under Road Utilities: Whenever a utility is proposed to be installed
under a road, the utility's location and construction shall meet the
requirements of the City for public roads, or the road owner for private roads.
In all instances, placement of utilities shall be coordinated with proposed
road improvements and shall be installed before the road is completed. (Ord.
442, - -2023)
9-7-4: EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS OF WAY:
   A.   Utility Easements: A general utility easement of at least ten feet
(10') in width shall be provided to each lot. Any shared components of sewage,
water, stormwater or other infrastructure systems shall either be within the
general utility easement, or within an easement dedicated or conveyed to the
entity responsible for maintenance. Easements must also be provided for
individual sewage lines and drainfields that will not be located on the same
parcel as residences.
   B.   Roads: Rights of way for public and private roads shall meet the
requirements of the City as outlined in the "Supplemental Construction
Specifications to the ISPWC and Design Standards" adopted by the City of Athol.
Cut and fill slopes and stormwater systems adjacent to roads and driveways must
either be shown as easements or rights of way in favor of the maintenance
entity. When future access may be needed to adjacent parcels of land, road
easements and rights of way shall extend to the property line of the
subdivision.
   C.   Trails And Sidewalks: Public trail easements or rights of way may be
required, depending on the location of the subdivision and the need for
pedestrian trails or sidewalks. If required, they shall be dedicated or
conveyed to the City or to the maintenance entity. The width of trail easements
and rights of way shall be adequate for the intended use, and shall meet the
requirements of the city and the maintenance entity. When future access may be
needed to adjacent parcels of land, trail easements and rights of way shall
extend to the property line of the subdivision.
   D.   Other Requirements:
      1.   All required easements and rights of way shall be shown on the face
of the plat. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-5: SUBDIVISION AND LOT DESIGN:
   A.   Compatibility: Subdivisions shall be designed to be compatible with
existing homes, businesses and neighborhoods, and with the natural
characteristics of the area. Subdivisions shall minimize grading, road
construction and disturbance of the terrain, vegetation, soils, and
drainageways, and shall prevent soil erosion. To achieve this, the Council may
require building envelopes, no disturbance zones, height restrictions and
planting or retention of vegetation. The Council may also require a suitable
perimeter fence for the subdivision to buffer incompatible uses.
   B.   Lot Design: Subdivisions must result in lots of reasonable utility and
livability. Subdivision designs shall not contain irregular configurations that
result in unusable land or that may cause future land use conflicts. All
building lots must have at least one building site that can meet required
setbacks and be accessed with a driveway which complies with the fire district
access standards
   C.   Lot Access: All new lots shall have frontage and direct access onto a
public road, unless an alternative design or private roads are approved through
the PUD process. A previously existing lot with an existing residence shall not
be considered a new lot. No new accesses to individual lots are permitted from
state highways. When warranted for public safety, the City or Idaho
Transportation Department may require relocation, reconfiguration,
consolidation or elimination of existing approaches.
   D.   Continuity: No single lot shall be divided by a right of way, road,
municipal boundary line, or by another parcel of land.
   E.    Public Access, Parks and Facilities: Public access easements or the
conveyance of land for public access may be required for subdivisions that are
contiguous to public lands, or for areas designated in a city facilities
acquisition plan. If so required, the property owner shall be paid fair market
value for the easement or land. For developments which include 25 residential
lots or greater, dedication of parkland shall be required unless specifically
waived by the City. The parkland shall be at least 21,780 square feet and said
minimum size shall increase by 800 square feet for each residential lot over
25. Land for parks shall be located and configured to encourage use and serve
the intended function. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-6: ROADS AND TRAILS:
   A.   Public And Private Roads:
      1.   Roads within subdivisions shall comply with the most current edition
of the "Idaho Standards For Public Works Construction" and the "Supplemental
Construction Specifications to the ISPWC and Design Standards" as adopted by
resolution of the City Council ("the Standards"). Such roads shall be dedicated
as public roads to the City, unless the Council determines it to be in the
public interest to dedicate the road to another public highway agency.
      2.   When future access may be needed to adjacent parcels of land, roads
shall extend to the property line of the subdivision or condominium unless
topography or other factors make continuation of the road impossible or
impracticable.
      3.   Privately owned and maintained roads may only be allowed within
approved Planned Unit Developments, or as an emergency egress, as approved by
the Council.
   B.   Connectivity: Roads, trails and sidewalks in subdivisions shall be
designed to complement and enhance existing transportation systems so as to
create an integrated network that allows for the safe and efficient movement of
people within the subdivision, to adjacent subdivisions, and to nearby
commercial areas, schools, places of worship, and other community facilities.
Roads shall be designed with as many connections as possible, and with
relatively direct routes in and out of the subdivision, without running traffic
through previously established neighborhoods. Cul-de-sacs are discouraged but
may be approved where natural or built features preclude connection to existing
or future roads. A newly developed dead-end road shall not serve more than
twenty-five (25) parcels. Where feasible, subdivisions shall have at least two
(2) means of emergency access which comply with the standards of the fire
protection district with jurisdiction. When future access may be needed to
adjacent parcels of land, road and trail rights of way shall extend to the
property lines of the subdivision. Roads and trails shall be designed to
minimize conflict between vehicles and pedestrians.
   C.   Road Names, Signing, And Addressing: All road names, identification
signs, and addressing shall comply with City requirements.
   D.   Pedestrian And Bicycle Access:
      1.   Off road trails, lanes or walkways may be required:
         a.   If shown on a bicycle facilities plan adopted by the City or
public highway agency with jurisdiction;
         b.   Along through streets in subdivisions within one mile of a
school, park, bicycle trail, recreational area, or community facility; or
         c.   When necessary to ensure the safety of pedestrians and
bicyclists.
      2.   The trail shall be designed to serve the intended use, and except
for bicycle lanes, shall be separated from the road by a vegetation strip at
least five feet (5') wide. If there is no direct route through a subdivision,
or if cul-de-sacs are proposed, one or more trails may be required to provide
short, direct routes for pedestrians. For safety, trails should be located in
close proximity to and visible from homes and streets. If a trail or walkway is
required, an easement or right of way must be dedicated to an appropriate
entity who will be responsible for maintenance. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-7: IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Installation Of Improvements:
      1.   Before application for final approval of any plat, required
improvements shall be either:
         a.   Installed and approved by the design professional who developed
the plans and the agencies with jurisdiction or providing services; or
         b.   Secured by a financial guarantee and subdivision completion
agreement which complies with the standards set forth in sections
9-7-9 and
9-8-8 and has been approved by the Administrator.
      2.   If a portion of the work has been completed and approved by the
design professional and agencies with jurisdiction or providing services, only
the remaining work will need to be covered by the financial guarantee.
   B.   Plan Approval and Site Disturbance Permit:
      1.   Approvals Required: No site disturbance, terrain modification,
construction or clearing shall take place until preliminary subdivision
approval has been granted, construction plans have been approved by all
agencies with jurisdiction and those providing services, and a site disturbance
permit has been issued by the City.
      2.    Construction Plan Signature: All construction plans shall be
stamped and/or signed by an Idaho licensed professional engineer or other
appropriate design professional.
      3.   Dust Control Required: Dust control is required on all construction
sites, and a dust control plan must be submitted for review and approval by the
Administrator prior to the start of any site work. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-8: OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Operation And Maintenance Required: All subdivision improvements,
common areas and green space shall be operated and maintained by the owner, in
accordance with applicable best management practices and approved plans. An
organization that will operate and maintain shared land and improvements must
be, or have been, established prior to or concurrent with final approval and
recordation of the plat. Organizational options include taxing districts (such
as water or sewer districts), for profit corporations, limited liability
companies or other lawfully created business entities, nonprofit corporations,
limited liability companies or other lawfully created business entities, or
cooperative corporations such as a homeowners' association. If private
maintenance by a cooperative corporation is proposed, the documents
establishing the organization must be approved by the Administrator, and must
be recorded concurrently with the plat. In addition, if land or improvements
are going to be owned and managed by a cooperative corporation, and the
corporation ceases to exist, or fails to fulfill its obligations, the
individual lot owners shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
land and improvements.
   B.   City Authority to Maintain Private Systems: If a private maintenance
organization fails to maintain commonly owned land, shared infrastructure or
improvements in accordance with applicable BMPs and approved maintenance plans,
the City may perform, or contract for the performance of, the necessary
maintenance, and the Administrator may bill individual property owners for the
associated costs. Any unpaid assessments may result in termination of the
service. Before any action may be taken, the City shall notify the maintenance
organization and the property owners within the subdivision of the deficiencies
and the intended action via certified mail. Any notices sent via certified mail
which are returned to the City shall be re- sent via first class mail. The City
shall give the property owners and maintenance organization at least forty five
(45) days to correct the deficiencies before taking action. A property owner or
affected person may appeal the proposed action in accordance with Section
1-1-5 of City Code. Nothing in this section shall obligate the City to provide
maintenance of private systems. (Ord. 442, - -2023)
9-7-9: FINANCIAL GUARANTEES:
   A.   Financial Guarantee in Lieu of Improvements: Financial guarantees may
be provided in lieu of improvements upon review and approval by the
Administrator and all affected agencies prior to application for final approval
of a subdivision. If an agency is unwilling or unable to approve a financial
guarantee, the Administrator may assume this authority. The amount of the
guarantee shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the estimated cost of
construction and the expiration date of the guarantee shall be at least sixty
(60) days after the expected agency approval date for the improvements. Cost
estimates shall be developed by the design professional who developed the
construction plans. If it is anticipated that improvements will be completed
over a period of time, separate financial guarantees should be provided (e.g.,
one for roads, another for the water system, etc.). Partial releases are not
permitted.
   B.   Warranty: A separate financial guarantee is required as a warranty to
ensure correction of any deficiencies identified within twelve (12) months of
final approval of improvements. The amount of this warranty shall be twenty
percent (20%) of the total cost of construction. If improvements are completed
and approved by applicable agencies and design professionals prior to
application for final subdivision approval, the warranty shall be provided with
the application. If improvements are to be completed after final approval, the
warranty shall be provided prior to release of the financial guarantee for
construction. If the applicant fails to provide this warranty, the director may
withdraw a portion of the construction guarantee to meet this requirement or
may take other enforcement action as authorized by law.
   C.   Subdivision Completion and Warranty Agreements: A subdivision
completion and warranty agreement which complies with the requirements of
section
9-8-8 shall accompany each financial guarantee, and must be approved by the
Administrator. These agreements shall be contractually binding on the City and
the property owner, and, if a party to the agreement, the contractor. Financial
guarantees shall provide for installation and agency approval of improvements
within two (2) years from the date of final subdivision approval. Upon written
request by the property owner, the Administrator may grant one extension of up
to one year for good cause shown.
   D.   Types Of Financial Guarantees:
      1.   The City will accept the following types of financial guarantees:
         a.   An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution
chartered by the federal government or a state government.
         b.   Cash deposit (cash, cashier's check, bank draft, or money order).
         c.   Certificate of deposit or other similar bank account which
provides that the board and the director have exclusive access to the account.
         d.   Surety bond.
   E.   Failure To Complete Improvements or Correct Deficiencies: Any failure
to complete improvements or correct deficiencies in accordance with a
subdivision completion or warranty agreement and approved plans shall
constitute good and sufficient cause for the Administrator to take enforcement
action as authorized by law, and/or to draw on the funds and contract for
completion of the work. In addition to direct costs to complete the work, the
Administrator may also withdraw funds to cover the City's administrative costs
associated with such actions. Before any action may be taken, the City shall
give the property owner written notice via certified mail. Any notice sent via
certified mail which is returned to the City shall be re-sent via first class
mail. The property owner shall permit the contractor and City staff to access
the property to complete the necessary improvements. If the Administrator or
City is unable to gain access to the funds, or if costs exceed the value of the
financial guarantee, the property owner will be billed for the outstanding
balance.
   F.   Release Of Financial Guarantee: No financial guarantee shall be
released until the associated improvements have been approved in writing by the
agencies with jurisdiction or providing services, the developer's design
professional and the Administrator. No partial releases are permitted. (Ord.

This title shall be known and may be cited as the INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ORDINANCE. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-1-2: AUTHORITY:
This title is enacted pursuant to the City of Athol's (the "City") general
police powers, its authority to enact ordinances, and its authority as provided
by the Idaho Development Impact Fee Act codified at Chapter 82 of Title 67,
Idaho Code (the "Act") and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho to
impose, collect development impact fees pursuant to its authority to enter into
an intergovernmental agreement as provided for in Idaho Code section 67-8204A.
(Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-1-3: APPLICABILITY:
Except as otherwise exempted in section
10-5-1, these provisions shall apply to the development of property located
within the boundaries of the City of Athol, Idaho. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-1-4: FINDINGS:
   A.   Timberlake Fire Protection District ("the Fire District") is a taxing
District organized and existing by virtue of Chapter 14 of Title 31, Idaho
Code, and the Fire District's boundaries include all areas within the City
limits of the City and areas surrounding the City.
   B.   The Fire District's duty and responsibility is to provide protection of
property against fire and the preservation of life, and enforcement of any of
the fire codes and other rules that are adopted by the state fire marshal; and
provide for the protection and preservation of life.
   C.   Kootenai County Emergency Medical Services Systems (the "Ambulance
District") is an ambulance service district organized and existing by virtue of
Chapter 39 of Title 31 Idaho Code and the and the Ambulance District's
boundaries include all areas within the City limits of the City and the entire
area of Kootenai County.
   D.   The Ambulance District's duty and responsibility is to provide
ambulance services.
   E.   The City is experiencing considerable growth and development.
   F.   The purposes of the Act (Idaho Code section 67-8202) are as follows:
      1.   Ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new
growth and development;
      2.   Promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments, such as the City and the District, may
require those who benefit from new growth and development pay (development
impact fees) their proportionate share of the costs of new public facilities
needed to serve that new growth and development; and
      3.   Establish minimum standards for adoption of development impact fee
ordinances by cities; and
      4.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and development are
required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the cost of public
facilities needed to serve that new growth and development and to prevent
duplicate and ad hoc development requirements; and
      5.   To empower cities to adopt ordinances to impose development impact
fees.
   G.   The Act does not authorize the Fire District or the Ambulance District
to enact a development impact fee ordinance.
   H.   The Act does provide, pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-8204A, in
circumstances where the City and a fire district and a City and an ambulance
district are both affected by the considerable growth and development as is
occurring within the City, that the City and these districts may enter into an
intergovernmental agreement for the purpose of agreeing to collect and expend
development impact fees for system improvements which provides for a new
funding mechanism for those system improvements costs incurred by these
districts to meet the demand and growth occurring within the City and which
promotes and accommodates orderly growth and development and protects the
public health, safety and general welfare of the residences within the
boundaries of the City.
   I.   New growth within the City imposes and will impose increasing and
excessive demands upon the Fire District's and upon the Ambulance District's
existing capital facilities.
   J.   New growth within the City is expected to continue, and will place
ever-increasing demands on the Fire District and the Ambulance District to each
provide and expand their capital facilities to serve that new growth.
   K.   The tax revenues generated from new development within the City often
do not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements and
expansion of existing Fire District and Ambulance District capital facilities
to accommodate for that new growth.
   L.   Idaho Code section 67-8204A authorizes the City to adopt an impact fee
system and to enter into the intergovernmental agreements with the Fire
District and with the Ambulance District to offset, recoup, or reimburse the
portion of the costs of needed improvements to each of their capital facilities
caused by new growth and development in the City.
   M.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system facilitated by the
intergovernmental agreement with each District, will promote the purposes set
forth in the Act, in that it would: (a) ensure that each District has adequate
capital facilities which are available to serve new growth and development; (b)
promote orderly growth and development by establishing uniform standards by
which the City may require that those who benefit from new growth and
development pay a proportionate share of the cost of each of the District's
capital facilities needed to serve new growth and development in the City; (c)
establish minimum standards for the adoption of Fire District and Ambulance
District impact fees; (d) ensure that those who benefit from new growth and
development are required to pay no more than their proportionate share of the
cost of each District's capital facilities needed to serve new growth and
development in the City; and (e) prevent duplicate and ad hoc development
requirements in the City.
   N.   Each Capital Improvements Plan contains the capital improvements
planned by each District during the term of their Capital Improvements Plan,
and such element has been developed in conformance with the requirements
Chapter 82 of Title 67, Idaho Code.
   O.   Each Capital Improvements Plan sets forth reasonable methodologies and
analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on
each District's capital facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or
constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities
created by new development.
   P.   In accordance with Idaho Code, each Capital Improvements Plan was based
on actual system improvements costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. In
addition, each Capital Improvements Plan uses a fee calculation methodology
that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated
by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are
anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements, including taxes,
assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers.
   Q.   The Fire District impact fees established by this title are based on
the Fire District's Capital Improvements Plan, and do not exceed system
improvements costs to serve new development that will pay the Fire District
impact fees.
   R.   The Ambulance District impact fees established by this title are based
on the Ambulance District's Capital Improvements Plan, and do not exceed system
improvements costs to serve new development that will pay the Ambulance
District impact fees.
   S.   The Fire District's capital facilities and the Ambulance District's
capital facilities, include in the calculation of the fees in their Capital
Improvements Plans, will benefit all new residential development throughout the
City, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the City as a
single service area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and spending the
each district's impact fees collected from developers.
   T.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
development impacts created by each type of development covered by this title,
the development impact fees assessment of such development covered by this
title, and the development impact fees that such developer will be required to
pay.
   U.   This title creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
developers will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the costs
incurred by each of the districts to construct and/or purchase system
improvements in ways that benefit the development for which each development
impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after the development
impact fee is paid, and in conformance with Idaho Code section 67-8210.
   V.   This title creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for either of the District capital
facilities, or to replace or rehabilitate either of the existing District
capital facilities, or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those
facilities.
   W.   This title creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of development impact fees, in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-
8204(19).
   X.   This title is consistent with all applicable provisions of the Act
concerning development impact fee ordinances. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-1-5: PURPOSE:
   A.   This title is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement the
Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   The intent of this title is to ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of system improvements; to ensure that such
proportionate share does not exceed the cost of such system improvements
required to accommodate new development; and to ensure that funds collected
from new development are actually used for system improvements in accordance
with the Act.
   C.   It is the further intent of this title to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of system improvements to
new development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by the Act.
   D.   It is not the intent of this title to collect any money from any new
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
system improvements created by such new development.
   E.   It is the intent of this title that any monies collected, as an imposed
Fire District and Ambulance District impact fee, are deposited in each separate
District impact fee capital projects trust fund account, are never commingled
with monies from a different impact fee account, are never used for a
development impact fee component different from that for which the fee was
paid, are never used to correct current deficiencies in the each District's
capital facilities, and are never used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain or
operate any District capital facilities of either District. (Ord. 439, 10-18-
2022)
10-1-6: ADVISORY COMMITTEE/CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN:
   A.   The City has formed an advisory committee as required by Idaho Code
section 67-8205, and the committee has performed the duties required of it
pursuant to Idaho Code sections 67-8205 and 67-8206(2). The City, the Fire
District and the Ambulance District intend that the committee will continue to
exist and perform those duties identified in Idaho Code section 67-8205 that
occur following the adoption of this Development Impact Fee Ordinance.
   B.   The Fire District has planned for the improvement of that District's
fire prevention and EMS services capital facilities in the Capital Improvements
Plan.
   C.   The Ambulance District has planned for the improvement of that
District's ambulance services capital facilities in the Capital Improvements
Plan.
   D.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the City to
accommodate new Development, and would assist each of these Districts in
implementing their capital improvements element of the Capital Improvements
Plan.
   E.   In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the Fire
District's fire prevention and EMS facilities, the City adopted by resolution
and the Fire District Board of Commissioners adopted by resolution the
Timberlake Fire Protection District Impact Fee Study and Capital Improvements
Plan (the "Fire District Capital Improvements Plan").
   F.   In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the Ambulance
District's ambulance facilities, the City adopted by resolution and the
Ambulance District Board of Commissioners adopted by resolution the Kootenai
County Emergency Medical Services System Impact Fee Study and Capital
Improvement Plan (the "Ambulance District Capital Improvements Plan").
   G.   The methodology used in the Fire District Capital Improvements Plan and
the Ambulance District Capital Improvements Plan, as applied through this
title, complies with all applicable provisions of Idaho law, including those
set forth in Idaho Code sections 67-8204(1), (2), (16) and (23), 67-8207 and
67-8209. The incorporation of the Capital Improvements Plan by reference
satisfies the requirement in Idaho Code section 67-8204(16) for a detailed
description of the methodology by which the District impact fees were
calculated, and the requirement in Idaho Code section 67-8204(24) for a
description of acceptable levels of service for each District's system
improvements.
   H.   In determining the proportionate share of each District's system
improvements costs, each Capital Improvements Plan has considered:
      1.   The cost of the existing system improvements; and
      2.   The means by which the existing system improvements have been
financed; and
      3.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to system
improvements costs through taxation, assessment, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to system improvements costs
through developer or landowner contributions; and
      4.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
system improvements costs in the future; and
      5.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area or areas; and
      6.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development; and
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation and includes a plan for
alternative sources of revenue. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)

development. A request for an individual assessment process shall involve
consideration of studies, data, and any other relevant information submitted by

files a request for the use of an individual assessment, the fee payer shall be
responsible for retaining a qualified professional to prepare the individual
assessment that complies with the requirements of this title, at the fee
payer's expense. The fee payer shall, at the fee payer's expense, bear the
burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the resulting
individual assessment complies with the requirements of this title. The fee
payer shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
the resulting individual assessment is a more accurate measure of its
proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, based on the District's
adopted levels of service, than the District impact fees that would otherwise
be due pursuant to pursuant to section
10-3-3 and their Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   Each individual assessment shall be based on the same level of service
standards and unit costs for system improvements used in the Capital

with the City at any time that the number of dwelling units in the proposed
development and the types and amounts of development in each non-residential
category identified in section
10-3-3 and the Capital Improvements Plan as known. Upon filing of a request for
individual assessment, the City shall transmit the request to the District
Administrator for review. The District Administrator shall issue a written
decision within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed request for
individual assessment together with all supporting information from the fee
payer, so as not to unreasonably delay the developer's (fee payer's) subsequent
applications to the City for building permits.
   D.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the District
Administrator may then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by
the District Administrator as the basis for calculating the District Impact
Fees. The criteria for acceptance, rejection or acceptance with modifications
shall be whether the individual assessment is a more accurate measure of demand
for system improvements element(s) created by the proposed development, or the
costs of those facilities, than the applicable fee shown in the fee schedule
attached to the Capital Improvements Plan.
   E.   The decision by the District Administrator on request for an individual
assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the District
Impact Fees, shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the District
Impact Fees are intended to be used, and shall include an explanation of those
factors identified in Idaho Code section 67-8207.

      1.   One hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the county assessor; or
      2.   That fair market value established by a private appraiser acceptable
to the District in an appraisal paid for by the fee payer.
   B.   Improvements: Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall be valued by the District at the present value of
such improvements based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates submitted by the fee payer to the District. The
District administrator shall determine the amount of credit due based on the
information submitted, or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate
or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable
to the District as a more accurate measure of the value of the offered system
improvements to the District. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-7-4: WHEN CREDITS BECOME EFFECTIVE:
   A.   Land: Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when
the land has been conveyed to the District in a form acceptable to the
District, at no cost to the District, and has been accepted by the District.
Upon request of the fee payer, the District shall issue a letter stating the
amount of credit available.
   B.   Improvements. Approved credits for acquisition or construction of
system improvements shall generally become effective when (a) all required
construction has been completed and has been accepted by the District, (b) a
suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the
District, and (c) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and
acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the District and the State of Idaho. Upon request of the fee
payer, the District shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit
available. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-7-5: CREDIT REQUEST PROCEDURES:
   A.   Request: In order to obtain a credit against District impact fees
otherwise due, a fee payer shall submit to the City a written offer of request
to dedicate to the District specific parcels of qualifying land or a written
offer to contribute or construct specific System Improvements to the District
capital facilities in accordance with all applicable state or City design and
construction standards, and shall specifically request a credit against the
type of District impact fees for which the land dedication or system
improvements is offered. The City shall then deliver the written offer of
request to the District Administrator.
   B.   Review: After receipt of the written offer of request for credit, the
District Administrator shall review the request and determine whether the land
or system improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing
District capital facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the
credit. If the District Administrator determines that the offered credit
satisfies the criterion and will be acceptable to the Fire District Board of
Commissioners and/or the Ambulance District's District's Board of
Commissioners, as the case may be, then the credit shall be issued. The
District shall complete its review and determination of an application within
thirty (30) days after receipt of an application for credit.
   C.   Credits exceeding fee amounts due. If the credit due to a fee payer
pursuant to sections, above, exceeds the District impact fees that would
otherwise be due from the fee payer pursuant to this title (whether calculated
through the fee schedule attached to the capital improvement plan or through an
independent assessment), the fee payer may choose to receive such credit in the
form of either:
      1.   A credit against future District impact fees due for the same system
improvements; or
      2.   A reimbursement from District impact fees paid by future development
that impacts the system improvements contributed or dedicated by the fee payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the fee payer, the District shall
be under no obligation to use any District funds - other than District impact
fees paid by other development for the same system improvements - to reimburse
the fee payer for any credit in excess of District impact fees that are due.
   D.   Written Agreement Required: If credit or reimbursement is due to the
fee payer pursuant to this section, the District shall enter into a written
agreement with the fee payer, negotiated in good faith, prior to the
contribution, dedication, or funding of the system improvements giving rise to
the credit. The agreement shall provide for the amount of credit or the amount,
time and form of reimbursement, and shall have a term not exceeding ten (10)
years.
   E.   The District Administrator's determination on the written offer of
request for credit shall be provided to the fee payer and the City. The
Districts shall also provide to the City an instruction of the impact fee to
collect from the fee payer, if, after the Districts' acceptance of the request
for credit, the impact fee differs from the fee schedule. (Ord. 439, 10-18-
2022)

METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION OF FIRE PREVENTION AND EMS DISTRICT IMPACT FEES
SECTION:
10-8-1: General Provisions
10-8-2: Methodology; Proportionate Methodology
10-8-3: Proportionate Share Determination
10-8-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Accounting Principles: The calculation of the District impact fees
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
development impact fee shall not be deemed invalid because payment of the fee
may result in an incidental benefit to owners or developers within the service
area other than the fee payer.
   B.   Levels Of Service: The District impact fees shall be calculated on the
basis of levels of service for public facilities adopted in this title that are
applicable to existing development as well as new growth and development. The
construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing public
facilities for which the District impact fees are imposed must be attributable
to the capacity demands generated by the new development. (Ord. 439, 10-18-
2022)
10-8-2: METHODOLOGY; PROPORTIONATE METHODOLOGY:
The District impact fees shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of
the system improvements determined in accordance with Idaho Code section 67-
8207, as amended. District impact fees shall be based on actual system
improvements costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. The amount of the
District impact fees shall be calculated using the methodology contained in the
Capital Improvements Plan. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
10-8-3: PROPORTIONATE SHARE DETERMINATION:
   A.   District impact fees shall be based on a reasonable and fair formula or
method under which the District impact fees imposed does not exceed a
proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the District in
the provision of system improvements to serve the new development. The
proportionate share is the costs attributable to the new development after the
District consider the following:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land or construction of system improvements;
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new development in the form of user fees and debt service payments;
      3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by the
District to system improvements; and
      4.   All other available sources of funding such system improvements.
   B.   In determining the proportionate share of the cost of system
improvements to be paid by the developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the District and accounted for in the calculation of the District
impact fees:
      1.   The costs of existing system improvements within the service area;
      2.   The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
      3.   The extent to which the new development will contribute to system
improvements costs through taxation, assessments, or developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to system improvements costs
through developer or landowner contributions;
      4.   The extent to which the new development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
      5.   The extent to which the new development should be credited for
providing system improvements, without charge to other properties within the
service area;
      6.   Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
development;
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding system improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers and special taxation. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
CHAPTER 9
EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS
SECTION:
10-9-1: Extraordinary Impacts
10-9-1: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS:
Determinations of extraordinary impacts are made as follows:
   A.   In the event the City makes an initial determination that development
may impose extraordinary impact, the City shall provide the development
application to the District Administrator along with the City's initial
determination. The District Administrator shall then review and determine
whether or not the development application will impose extraordinary impact.
   B.   If the District Administrator determines that a proposed development
generates extraordinary impact that will result in extraordinary systems
improvements costs, the District Administrator will notify the fee payer and
the City of such District impact fees determination within thirty (30) days
after District Administrator's receipt from the City of the development
application and the City's initial determination. Such notice shall include a
statement that the potential impacts of such development on system improvements
are not adequately addressed by the Capital Improvements Plan, and that a
supplemental study, at the fee payer's expense will be required.
   C.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of extraordinary impact
include, but are not limited to:
      1.   An indication the assumptions used in the Capital Improvements Plan
underestimate the level of activity or impact on District capital facilities
from the proposed development or activity.
   D.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a development with
extraordinary impact, the District Administrator shall meet with the fee payer
to discuss whether the fee payer wants to:
      1.   Pay for the supplemental study necessary to determine the system
improvements costs related to the proposed development;
      2.   Modify the proposal to avoid generating extraordinary impact; or
      3.   Withdraw the application for certification, building permit or
development approval.
   E.   If the fee payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed development's proportionate share of system improvements
costs, then the District and the fee payer shall jointly select an individual
or organization acceptable to both to perform such study. The fee payer shall
enter into a written agreement with such individual or organization to pay the
costs of such study. Such agreement shall require the supplemental study to be
completed within thirty (30) days of such written agreement, unless the fee
payer agrees to a longer time.
   F.   Once the study has been completed, the fee payer may choose to:
      1.   Pay the proportionate share of system improvements costs documented
by the supplemental study; or
      2.   Modify the proposed development to reduce such costs; or
      3.   Withdraw the application. If the fee payer agrees to pay the system
improvements costs documented in the supplemental study, that agreement shall
be reduced to writing between the District and the fee payer prior to review
and consideration of any application for any development approval or building
permit related to the proposed development.
   G.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the fee payer to pay the proportionate
share of system improvements costs documented by the supplemental study,
nothing in this title shall obligate the City to approve development that
results in an extraordinary impact to the District. (Ord. 439, 10-18-2022)
