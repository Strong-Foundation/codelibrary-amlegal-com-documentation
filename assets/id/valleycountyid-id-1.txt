is willing to grant full or partial tax exemption requests.
      2.   The Board may require additional information from an applicant in
order to make a fully informed decision. If any information provided by the
applicant includes a trade secret, as that term is defined by Idaho law, the
Board may review the application materials in executive session.
      3.   If an application is approved, or partially approved, the applicant
and Valley County shall enter into a contract as a condition of approval for
the duration of the exemption period. The contract shall provide the terms and
conditions upon which the exemption is granted and shall give Valley County the
authority to terminate, modify, or impose additional requirements if the
contract is breached or if a project ceases to qualify for the tax exemption.
      4.   No later than March 1 of each year, beginning the year an exemption

not considered during the original approval. If it is determined that there is
a substantial change, it may be taken back to the Board of County Commissioners
for additional review.
      NOTICE: FAILURE TO TIMELY SUBMIT A COMPLETE ANNUAL REPORT IS GROUNDS FOR
TERMINATION OF THE EXEMPTION.
   F.   Termination or Expiration:

SCORING EVALUATION FOR TAX EXEMPTION
SECTION:
1-9-1: General; Purpose
1-9-2: Job Creation And Wages
1-9-3: Growth
1-9-4: Housing
1-9-5: Impact To Infrastructure
1-9-6: Scoring Matrix
1-9-1:  GENERAL; PURPOSE:
   A.   General: Title 1, Chapter 8 of the Valley County Code provides for the
property tax exemptions for certain types of commercial and industrial uses as
designated by Idaho State Statute. The exemption is intended to provide an
economic incentive for construction of capital improvements. Section
1-8-4 .F of this code is a Tax Percentage Reduction Table that uses the scoring
matrix as provided in this chapter.
   B.   Purpose:
      1. The scoring matrix is to be used as a tool to assist in the
determination of the percentage of property tax exemption.
      2. The Assessor prepares a preliminary scoring matrix. The Board of
County Commissioners shall review and may change based upon information
gathered in the public meeting with providers.
   C.   Response values will use the following criteria in the consideration of
scores in the matrix. (Ord. 19-08, 9-30-2019)
1-9-2:  JOB CREATION AND WAGES:
   A.   New or existing business in Valley County:
      Is the business new to the county (yes or no)? Yes = 10 No= 0
   B.   How many Jobs in the first year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5+ years:
      There are expected to be several jobs created at the start of business,
but long term growth is what we want to score. Assuming positive market
conditions, will the project consistently grow and add jobs? The more jobs
created over time, the higher the score.
      Example 1. 1st year 10 jobs, 2nd year 5 jobs, 3rd year 5 jobs, 4th year
10 jobs, 5th year 10 jobs = a score of 9-10;
      Example 2. 1st year 5 jobs, 2nd year 3 jobs, 3rd year 3 jobs, 4th year 0
jobs, 5th year 0 jobs. A score of 2-3
   C.   Wages of jobs. What percentage of PCI:
      Using the United States Census bureau most recent PCI (Per Capita
Income), what is percentage of the annual wages being paid by the project
compared to the PCI. Data can be found at this location https://www.census.gov/
quickfacts/fact/table/valleycountyidaho/POP010210
      Annual income / PCI = %:
      Example 1. Employee earns $35,000 a year, PCI $34,400. 35,000/
34,400=102%; score 10.
      Example 2. Employee earns $18,000 a year, PCI is $34,400 18,000/
34,400=52%; score 5.
   D.   Hiring from within local workforce:
      Are jobs going to be filled by local residents? Are jobs that need
specialized skill going to be transferred to Valley County permanently/
temporarily? Residents = % *1 , nonresident permanent = % *.5, nonresident
temporary
      Residents multiple by 1, nonresident permanently relocated multiply by
.5, nonresident temporary multiply by 0
      Example 1. 70% hired residents 30% hired nonresidents temporary. 70%*1.0=
7 30%*0=0; 7+0= score 7
      Example 2. If 50% hired residents, 30 % nonresident temporary, 20%
nonresidents permanent.
      50% * 1 =5, 30% *0 =0, 20% * . 5 =1; 5 +0 + 1= Score 6
   E.   Estimated full and part time jobs:
      Percentage of full time jobs to part time jobs. Full time jobs/total jobs
= Score
      Example 1. 50 employees. 30 are full time, 20 are part time. 30/50= 60%
full time score 6
      Example 2. 14 employees. 5 are full time, 9 are part time. 5/14=35% score
4 (rounded up) (Ord. 19-08, 9-30-2019)
1-9-3:  GROWTH:
   A.   Long term business plan:
      Well thought out viable long term plan which includes growth in positive
market conditions, plans for economic slowdowns with minimal layoffs, no
closure = high score, No business plan = no score.
      Example 1. The project has detailed outline and expects continued annual
growth, there is a contingency for a market slowdown Score 10
      Example 2. The project describes what they plan to do, but not in detail,
no projected growth, unsure of how well the business will operate over time
Score 3
   B.   Estimated growth over 5 years, 10 years:
      Duration of project 25 years or more = higher score; short term projects
10 years = low score.
      Example 1. The project plans on operating for 8 years then relocating.
Score 0
      Example 2. The project plans to operate indefinitely in Valley County.
Score 10 (Ord. 19-08, 9-30-2019)
1-9-4:  HOUSING:
   (Emphasis on employer provided housing).
   A.   Will the project offer employee housing:
      Example 1. The project will offer housing to all employees. Score 10
      Example 2. The project will offer housing to 50% of its workforce. Score
5
      Example 3. The project will only offer housing to management staff. Score
3
   B.   How many units:
      Percentage of housing to employees, some latitude for projects that have
large employee bases. Under 30 employees. # of employees receiving housing /
total # of employees.
      For large employers, in excess of 30 employees, the difference between
the percentage of employees housed versus not housed will receive only .5
deduction (60% not offered housing 60 *.5 =30% reduction).
      Example 1. The project plans to have 20 employees, all of whom will
receive on site housing. Score 10
      Example 2. The project will have 50 employees, but only have 25 housing
units, 50% * 1.5 = score 7.5
      Example 3. The project will not offer housing. Score = 0
      Example 4. The project will have 25 employees, only management staff of 4
is offered housing. 4 / 25 = 1.6 Score 2 (rounded up)
      Example 5. The project will have 28 employees. 14 employees will be
offered housing. 14 / 28 = Score 5
   C.   New structure:
      Multifamily housing, cannot be sold or used as temporary vacation
rentals, individual housing, cannot be sold or used as temporary vacation
rentals. If housing is built for more than 50% of employees, score 10, if
housing is built for less than 50% but more than 25% score 5, if housing is
built for less than 25% of employees, score 2.
   D.   Existing structure (Location):
      Impact on where housing is located, did it take away from overall market
rental opportunities?
      Example 1. Buildings exist on site, but were warehouses previously, then
converted into individual living units. Score 10
      Example 2. The project is going to utilize existing dwellings located on
site. Score 7
   Example 3. The project is purchasing existing building and converting it to
living units Score 10
   Example 4. The project purchases existing off site multifamily dwellings for
employee only use, displacing others. Score = 0 (Ord. 19-08, 9-30-2019)
1-9-5:  IMPACT TO INFRASTRUCTURE:
   (less impact = higher score)
   A.   Local Roads:
      Will the project include heavy equipment on the roads, will the employees
be commuting long distances?
      Example 1. Project will bus employees from specific location to site,
minimizing impact. Score 10
      Example 1a. Same as above, but the project will also have many heavy
equipment vehicles on the roadways. Score 6
      Example 2. The company will have 30 employees who commute. Score 4
      Example 2a. Same as above, however the project will also have several
heavy equipment vehicles on the roadways. Score 1
   B.   Local EMS, Fire District:
      Will the project consist of services that may put a strain on local
emergency services?
      Projects that have higher personal injury risk will get a low score.
      Projects that have new dwellings on site housing units will also have a
low score.
      May consult with EMS supervisors for guidance and impact.
      Example 1. The project will be a manufacturing facility that will employ
40 people. The people use heavy machine/tools for manufacturing. The potential
for injury or needed emergency response will be greater. Score 6
      Example 2. The project will have 20 dwelling units on site for employee
housing. Increasing the need for emergency services. Score 5
      Example 3. The project will relocate 30 employees to Valley County. More
demand on the emergency services. Score 6
      Example 4. The project is a manufacturing facility that uses large
machine tools and will employ 80, 30 people have been relocated to Valley
County, the project built 25 housing units on site, and 20 more units off site.
Using the above examples this will create a high demand for emergency services,
the score will be 0.
   C.   Local Law Enforcement District:
      Depending on which law enforcement district the project will be located
could have an impact towards law enforcement response time. Areas covered by
Valley County Sheriff's office may have an effect on response time; whereas
projects in the City of McCall may be able to respond faster.
      Example 1. The project is located in Yellow Pine. The Valley County
Sheriff office will have much longer response time versus if the project was
located in Cascade. Score will be 1.
   Example 2. The project is located in the City of McCall, response time would
be quicker. However, depending on the number of employees the project hires,
the City of McCall may need additional staff.
   D.   Local Hospital District:
      Will the project have an impact on the hospital district it is located
in? Is the project considered non-hazardous or hazardous?
      Example 1. The project is a sawmill that fabricates large glulam beams
and employs 20 people. This particular industry has a higher percentage of
worker injuries. The score would be 4.
      Example 1a. The same glulam sawmill will employ 200 people. The number of
employees would have a much larger impact versus the project that has 20
employees. The score would be 1.
      Example 2. The project will manufacture fishing poles. There are less
than 20 employees. This industry has a lower percentage of worker injuries. The
score would be 10
      Example 2a. The same fishing pole manufacture project will employ 200
people. While this is a statistically safer manufacturing project, the number
of employees would have a larger impact versus the project that has 20
employees. The score would be 7.
   E.   Local School District:
      If the project is primarily located in McCall school district, the amount
of employee's children put a strain on the school. If the project is located
primarily within the Cascade school district will the amount of employees'
children create an additional base for the school? This may need to be adjusted
over time as the capacity fluctuates.
      Example 1. Project is expected to employee 30 people in the McCall school
district, these employee's may have children who will attend public schools.
Score 3
      Example 2. Project is expected to employ 30 people in the Cascade school
district, these employee's may have children who will attend public schools.
Since Cascade Schools are under quota this could be seen as a positive impact.
Score 7
   F.   Environmental Impact/Pollution:
      Will the project emit pollution via air, water, land, noise, waste.
      Example 1. Project will have 2 smoke stacks, use existing water resources
for operations, will include machinery at the site, will operate 24 hours a
day. Score 1
      Example 2. Project has ensured every measure to limit the impacts of air,
noise, light, water pollutions. Score 10
   G.   Utilities (LEED):
      What measures will the project utilize to have less impact on the
environment?   
      Example 1. Solar panels and energy efficiency has been taken into account
during construction. Score 10
      Example 2. Poorly insulated building, heavy electric usage on the grid.
Score 1
   H.   Utilities - Electricity, Water, Sewer.
      Will the project place a strain on existing services, will those services
need upgraded to accommodate the project?
      Example 1. Project will need to tie into city sewer system, city water
system. Idaho Power will need to install new electric lines for the project.
Score 1
      Example 2. Project will tie into city sewer, but have their own well
system. Score 5
      Example 3. Project will provide their own septic, water and solar
electrical systems. Score 10
   I.   Utilizing of local businesses for material/goods.
      Will the project buy materials locally? Utilize legal, advertising, etc.
in their operations.
      Example 1. Project plans to contract a local machine company to make
parts, hires a local accountant and law firm. Score 10
      Example 2. Project will ship materials from out of the area when
resources are available in area. Does hire a local accountant, but hires other
services from out of the area. Score 3
      Example 3. Project does not utilize any existing businesses for
resources, tangible or intangible. Score 1 (Ord. 19-08, 9-30-2019)

Administrative Code.
   B.    Applicability: These operational rules, regulations and standards
apply to any user of the public waterways of Valley County, except for law
enforcement officials acting in their official capacity during an enforcement
or emergency action:

negligent behavior for any person to operate any type of vessel on the public
waters of Valley County in such a manner as to not pay proper attention to the
actual and potential hazards then existing; to operate at a rate of speed
greater than stated herein as permissible; or to operate in a manner that,
given the exercise of reasonable care, will prevent being able to stop said
vessel within the assured clear distance ahead. Specifically prohibited and
deemed negligent behavior is engaging any vessel in wake jumping or having it
become fully airborne; weaving at a speed greater than no wake through
congested traffic; or using a vessel to willfully harass another vessel, a
swimmer, a diver or any wildlife.
      2.    Age For Operation Of A Vessel Of Certain Type Or Horsepower:
         a.   It shall be unlawful to operate, or to allow someone to operate,
a motor driven vessel of 15 horsepower or less if the operator is a person

does not remedy the illegality if a reasonable person would determine that the
vessel is not being used and is being left unattended for more than three (3)
days.
      5.   Houseboat Anchoring: Houseboats, when overnighting on any Valley
County waterway, must tie up to a structure permitted for such use by the State

         b.   Point of reference for public roads and private roads will be the
beginning point of the road. The address for individuals located on these roads
will be to the nearest hundredth mile.
         c.   When individual lots in subdivisions are too small to address on
the mile marker system in hundredths of a mile, a smaller base unit may be used
in order to provide continuity in numbering the neighborhood.
   B.   Assignment Of Address Numbers:
      1.   Assigned By Planning And Zoning Administrator: All address numbers
located within the unincorporated and city impact areas of the county shall be
assigned by the Planning and Zoning Administrator or their designee. No other

in assigning such address numbers by the planning and zoning administrator or
his designee:
         a.   Only one number shall be assigned to each business, dwelling unit
or other use.
         b.   Numbers shall be assigned to vacant lots within platted
subdivisions and shall be assigned in such a manner that adequate numbers are
reserved for possible future development or resubdivisions of such land.
      c.   All addresses shall be assigned on the road upon which the driveway
enters. When vehicular access is used from a point other than the road
frontage, the number shall be placed so as to be visible from the fronting side
of the building. Typically, the entrance to the property determines frontage.
      d.   All addresses located on the north and east sides of roads shall be
even numbers. All addresses on the south and west sides of roads shall be odd
numbers. These requirements may be varied in the case of meandering roads. When
a road has been determined to be running in predominately one direction, the
number shall not be changed if there is slight change in the road direction.
   C.   Placement On New And Existing Buildings: Approved numbers or addresses
shall be placed on all new and existing buildings in such a position as to be
plainly visible and legible from the road fronting the property. Said numbers
shall contrast with their background, be visible in the daytime and nighttime
from the road, and be at least three and one-half inches (31/2") in height or
as approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator. Where the building is not
visible from the road, an additional address number shall be placed in a
location near the driveway that is plainly visible and legible from the road.
   D.   County One Unincorporated District: The county shall consist of one
unincorporated district with preference to existing roads, etc., for the areas
surrounding three (3) cities, i.e., Cascade, Donnelly, and McCall.

addresses begin. That point shall be zero.
      2.   Each initial point will be the point where north, south, east and
west designations are established for that addressing system.
   E.   Existing Nonconforming Numbers: Existing address numbers (in 1990) not
in conformance with the official rural addressing map may be changed by the
board, giving official written notice at least ninety (90) days in advance of
the effective date of such change to property owners and those local agencies
affected by such changes. If the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines
an address number is not in conformance the address may be changed by notifying
the property owner, utilities, assessor's office, and other interested parties.
An effective date shall be part of the notification. (Ord. 90-2, 7-23-1990;

give this chapter its most reasonable application:
   BUILDING OFFICIAL: The Valley County building official.
   EXTERIOR LIGHTING: Temporary or permanent lighting that is installed,
located or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outdoors. Lights
that are indoors that are intended to light something outside are considered
exterior lighting for the purpose of this chapter. Exterior lighting does not
include emergency or warning lights on vehicles.
   GLARE: Stray, unshielded light striking the eye that may result in:
   A.   Nuisance or annoyance glare such as light shining into a window;
   B.   Discomfort glare such as bright light causing squinting of the eyes;
   C.   Disabling glare such as bright light reducing the ability of the eyes
to see into shadows; or

8-1-3: ZONES:
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the
noninstrument approach zone, transition zone, horizontal zone and conical zone.
Such areas and zones are shown on the McCall Municipal Airport zoning map
consisting of an airport vicinity map with topographic contours, one sheet,
prepared by Philip Marshall, civil engineer, and dated February 14, 1974, which
is attached to the ordinance codified herein, and made a part hereof. The
various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
   A.   Visual Approach Zone: A visual approach zone shall have a width of two
hundred fifty feet (250') at a distance of two hundred feet (200') beyond each
end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand two
hundred fifty feet (1,250') at a distance of five thousand feet (5,000') beyond
each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline
of the runway, and has a slope of twenty to one (20:1).
   B.   Transitional Zone: These zones extend outward and upward at right
angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope
of seven to one (7:1) from the sides of the primary zone and from the sides of
the approach zones.
   C.   Horizontal Zone: A horizontal plane one hundred fifty feet (150') above
the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary
zone of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is five thousand feet (5,000')
for all runways designated as utility or visual. The radius of the arc
specified for each end of the runway will have the same arithmetical value.
   D.   Conical Zone: A zone extending outward and upward from the periphery of
the horizontal zone at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal
distance of four thousand feet (4,000').
   E.   Primary Zone: A zone longitudinally centered on a runway. When the
runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary zone extends two
hundred feet (200') beyond each end of that runway; but when the runway has no
specially prepared hard surface, the primary zone ends at each end of the
runway. The elevation of any point on the primary zone coincides with the
elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of a primary
zone is two hundred fifty feet (250') for utility runways having only visual
approaches.
   F.   Approach Zone: A zone longitudinally centered on the extended runway
centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary zone.
An approach zone is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of
approach available or planned for that runway end.
      1.   The inner edge of the approach zone is the same width as the primary
zone and it expands uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet
(1,250') for that end of a utility runway with only visual approaches.
      2.   The approach zone for utility runways with a visual approach extends
for a horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') at a slope of twenty
to one (20:1).
      3.   The outer width of an approach zone to an end of a runway will be
that width prescribed in this subsection for the most precise approach existing
or planned for that runway. (Ord. 74-4, 10-15-1974)
8-1-4: HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be
erected, altered, or allowed to grow, or maintained in any surface created by
this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for
such zone. Such height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones
in question as follows:
   A.   Visual Approach Zone For Utility Runway: One foot (1') in height for
each twenty feet (20') in horizontal distance beginning at a point on and at
the centerline elevation of the end of the runway and extending to a point five
thousand feet (5,000') from the end of the runway.
   B.   Transitional Zone: These zones extend outward and upward at right
angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope
of seven to one (7:1) from the sides of the primary zone and from the sides of
the approach zones.
   C.   Horizontal Zone: A horizontal plane one hundred fifty feet (150') above
the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary
zone of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is five thousand feet (5,000')
for all runways designated as utility or visual. The radius of the arc
specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That
value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway when a five
thousand foot (5,000') arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two (2)
adjacent ten thousand foot (10,000') arcs. The five thousand foot (5,000') arc
shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal
zone.
   D.   Conical Zone: A zone extending outward and upward from the periphery of
the horizontal zone a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance
of four thousand feet (4,000').
   E.   Excepted Height Limitations: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure
to a height up to thirty feet (30') above the surface of the land.
Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more
restrictive limitation shall prevail. (Ord. 74-4, 10-15-1974)
8-1-5: USE RESTRICTIONS:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to: a)
create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and
aircraft; b) make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of fliers using the airport; c) impair
visibility in the vicinity of the airport; or d) otherwise endanger the
landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. (Ord. 74-4, 10-15-1974)
8-1-6: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Regulations Not Retroactive: The regulations prescribed by this chapter
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or
alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of
the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any
nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the
construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof and is
diligently prosecuted.
   B.   Marking And Lighting: Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the
owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the director to indicate to the operators of
aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards.
Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the
expense of McCall Municipal Airport. (Ord. 74-4, 10-15-1974)
8-1-7: PERMITS:
   A.   Permit Required; Exceptions:
      1.   Permit Required: Except as specifically provided in the following
subsections, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no
structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established
in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for
and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determinations is in the affirmative,
the permit shall be granted.
      2.   Exceptions:
         a.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except, when
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone.
         b.   In the areas lying within the limits of the noninstrument
approach zones but at a distance of not less than five thousand feet (5,000')
from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height
limitation prescribed for such noninstrument approach zone.
         c.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height
except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
transitional zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any
structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this
chapter except as set forth in section
8-1-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to

hereto, or that existed when the application for a permit was made. Except as
indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the administrator
determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more
than eighty percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   D.   Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, must obtain a
permit from the administrator authorizing such action. Such variances shall be
allowed where literal application or enforcement of this chapter would result
in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would
not be contrary to the public interest or create hazards to air flight. Any
special permits may be allowed subject to such reasonable conditions as the
administrator may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,
including the condition that the owners of the structure or tree in question
permit the political subdivision of this state having an interest in the McCall
Municipal Airport to install, operate, and maintain, at its own expense, such
markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to fliers the presence of an
airport hazard. (Ord. 74-4, 10-15-1974)

9-1-8: ORGANIZATION AND USE OF TITLE:
   A.   Concepts: All lands or area of city impact, except as may be altered
under Idaho Code sections 67-6525 and 67-6526 in the unincorporated areas of
the county, are hereby classed into one multiple use district. The purpose of
one land use classification is to grant landowners maximum flexibility in using
and developing their properties. This concept is unlike traditional zoning
where general categories of land use are separated geographically from each
other in order to reduce the occurrence of incompatible uses on adjoining
properties. The multiple use concept depends on other methods to ensure
compatibility. In the county, where existing agricultural and open land uses
that protect, retain or enhance the natural beauty and open space
characteristics have been established as the desired standard for neighborhood
development, it is not necessary to review and evaluate those proposed changes
in use which continue similar practices, character and level of activity and
are inherently compatible with the agrarian heritage. However, agricultural
uses which change the character of the existing neighborhood development,
either by practice, intensity or structure, shall be reviewed as a conditional
use. It is also necessary to classify some other land uses as conditional so
they can be reviewed and evaluated individually by the commission and commented
upon by neighboring landowners as to their compatibility with existing uses.
This title is organized to first define and set standards and procedures for
those uses which are considered inherently compatible or "permitted" uses.
Secondly, to define and set standards and procedures for those uses which are
considered "conditional". Finally, this title defines and sets standards and
procedures for special areas, sign standards, cell towers, planned unit
developments, and provides guidelines for administration and enforcement.
   B.   Questions In Posing Land Use Change: In using this title, any person
proposing a land use change will need to know the answer to the following
questions:
      1.   Is the land use proposed a permitted use or a conditional use?
      2.   Is the land use proposed within a special area?
      3.   What standards and procedures will apply to the proposed use?    
   C.   Multiple-Use District:
      1.   Permitted Uses: "Permitted uses" within the multiple use district
are defined in chapter 4 of this title. Standards and procedures for permitted
uses are also contained in chapter 4 of this title. There may be additional
standards affecting the proposed use in chapter 6, "Special Areas", of this
title.
      2.   Conditional Uses:
         a.   "Conditional uses" within the multiple use district are defined
in chapter 5 of this title. There may be additional standards affecting the
proposed use in chapter 6, "Special Areas", of this title; chapter 8, "Wireless
Telecommunications Towers And Antennas", of this title; or chapter 9, "Planned
Unit Developments", of this title.
         b.   "Conditional uses" within the multiple use district are defined
in chapter 5 of this title. Standards and procedures for conditional uses are
also contained in chapter 5 of this title. There may be additional standards
affecting the proposed use in chapter 6 of this title; chapter 8 of this title,
or chapter 9 of this title.
   D.   Guide To Land Use Classification: Table 3-A, section
 9-3-1 of this title, is a guide to land use classifications and their status
as permitted or conditional uses. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)

9-4-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Review Not Required: This chapter contains standards and procedures for
those uses which are likely to be compatible with existing land uses in the
multiple use district of the county and, therefore, review by the commission
and public is not necessary.
   B.   Review Required: Permitted uses are listed in section
 9-3-1, table 3-A of this title, and in section
9-4-8, table 4-A of this chapter. If land use is proposed which is not provided
for within section
9-3-1, table 3-A of this title, its status as a permitted or conditional use
shall be determined by the planning and zoning commission based upon its
similarity and dissimilarity to uses that are listed, particularly with respect
to its visual attributes, its demand for public services and facilities, and
its external impacts or imposition upon adjacent properties (the latter
determined with regard to the permitted uses on that adjacent property). (Ord.
10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-4-2: POLICY:
   A.   The comprehensive plan states that "planning be instituted to preserve
the open characteristics and scenic beauty of the county", and an objective
stated therein is to "preserve agricultural land for farming and allow nonfarm
development in rural areas only when it does not interfere with the productive
and profitable level of agriculture".
   B.   This section is intended to fulfill those goals and objectives of the
comprehensive plan by:
      1.   Defining those uses which are agricultural in nature or inherently
compatible therewith.
      2.   Recognizing those uses as the standard by which other uses are
compared for compatibility.
      3.   Protecting those areas from encroachment by noncompatible uses.
      4.   Allowing those uses to be pursued without unnecessary regulation.
      5.   Providing certain standards and procedures which are intended to
upgrade or enhance the permitted use.
   C.   The interpretation of the standards and procedures herein shall be to
encourage the expansion and improvement of permitted uses. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-

this chapter.
   B.   Single-Family Residence: However, in no case, shall a single- family
residence be located on a lot split from a platted lot or on a parcel of land
divided from an original parcel without platting that is less than one acre in
area where individual sewage disposal and individual water supply system are
proposed. Where either a central water supply system or a central sewage
collection and disposal system, or both, is available, such lots or parcels
shall be not less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area. The
minimum areas stated in this section do not apply to original parcels. (Ord.

establishing the principal use on the property and the access street or road.
   E.   Encroachment By Other Structures: No other structures may encroach on
the yards determined for the structure establishing the principal use.
   F.   Measurement: Setbacks shall be measured horizontally, perpendicular to
the property line, to the nearest corner or projections or overhang.
   G.   Adjustment Of Front Or Rear Yard Setbacks: The minimum front or rear
yard setbacks may be adjusted to allow a proposed principal use building to
conform with the average setback of existing similar buildings on adjoining
properties within the same block; however, no setback may be less than seven
and one-half feet (7.5').
   H.   Lots Having Common Boundary Line With BLM Property Surrounding Cascade
Reservoir: Minimum rear yard setbacks for those lots having a common boundary
line with bureau of reclamation property surrounding Cascade Reservoir are
seven and one-half feet (7.5'), but may not be less than that provided for in
subsection C of this section. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)

property description, size of pond, use of pond, plans for mitigating fugitive
dust, revegetation plan to return the area surrounding the pond to natural
conditions, intentions for stockpiling or removing excess material, and list of
other permits obtained. The administrator may determine that a conditional use
permit is required for an extractive industrial use. If neither a conditional
use permit nor excavation permit is required, the dirt must, at a minimum, be
spread or bermed and reseeded.
   F.   Best Management Practices: Best management practices should be used for
surface water management for permanent management and during construction to
control or prevent the erosion, mass movement, siltation, sedimentation, and
blowing of dirt and debris caused by grading, excavation, open cuts, side
slopes, and other site preparation and development. Water should be retained on
site or directed to drainage easements, natural drainages, or rights of way.
Water should not be directed onto adjoining properties.

subject to the following conditions:
   A.   Water And Sewer: The ADU must meet all requirements of Idaho Central
District Health with respect to the provision of individual potable water and
sewage disposal facilities, or have a permit from an approved central sewage
treatment facility. Issuance of a permit for the ADU must not adversely impact
others within the neighborhood from obtaining a permit for septic, sewer, or
well if the neighbor has not constructed their first residence on their
neighboring lot.
   B.   Square Footage: The square footage of the ADU may not exceed the lesser
of one thousand (1,000) square feet or fifty percent (50%) of the square
footage of the primary structure, excluding open storage areas, garages, and
carports.
   C.   Setback Requirements: The ADU may be attached to the primary structure,
the garage, or be freestanding, and shall be subject to the same setback
requirements as the primary structure.
   D.   Parking Space: The ADU must be provided with at least one parking
space. Parking will not be allowed in a public right-of-way or in the required
setbacks.
   E.   Design Elements: The ADU must utilize design elements of the primary
structure in order to maintain consistency and clearly signify its subordinate
relationship to the primary structure. These elements may include roof pitch,
siding, structure shape and placement, etc. The exterior appearance of the
structure must be compatible with the primary structure. The administrator
shall determine whether this condition has been satisfied. The property owner
shall be responsible to provide adequate information with the building permit
submittal to determine if design elements satisfy requirements.
   F.   Use As Bed And Breakfast: The ADU cannot be used as a commercial or bed
and breakfast use without a conditional use permit. Sleeping quarters only are
not considered ADUs.
   G.   Use As Long-term Rental Property: If used as a permitted residential
rental property, an ADU must be rented for a minimum of more than thirty (30)
days (not as a weekly or daily rental).
   H.   Use as a Short-term Rental Property: If the ADU changes from a long
term rental to a short term rental or constructed with the intent of being a
short-term rental property of thirty (30) days or less then a conditional use
permit will be required and must be in compliance with the rules of the state
tax commission under Chapter 36, Title 63, Idaho Code.
   I.   Occupation By Owner Required: ADUs are permitted only when one of the
primary structures on the property is owner-occupied. Owner-occupied structure
does not need to be the primary residence. Ownership cannot be fractional or
timeshare ownerships.
   J.   Notice To Adjacent Property Owners; Objections: The administrator shall
notify property owners within three hundred feet (300') of the property
boundaries.
      1.   Objections to the application must be written and received by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator within ten (10) working days. Objections must
give specific grounds and facts upon which the objection is based. If the
Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that objections are sufficient to
warrant a conditional use permit, the applicant shall be notified promptly that
a conditional use permit is required.
      2.   If there are no objections within ten (10) working days, the
accessory dwelling unit will be issued an administrative permit and be a
permitted use. Fees for ADU permits may be adopted by Resolution of the Board
of County Commissioners.
   K.   The ADU permit will be a condition of the building permit. (Ord. 10-06,

CHAPTER 5
CONDITIONAL USES
SECTION:
9-5-1: General Provisions
9-5-2: Policy
9-5-3: Standards
9-5-4: Table 5-A, Standards For Conditional Uses; Figures
9-5-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Standards And Procedures: This chapter contains standards and
procedures for those uses which may be incompatible with permitted uses in the
multiple use district of the county and, therefore, are subject to review and
evaluation by the commission and the public. Conditional uses may be allowed
only after proper application, review, approval, and mitigation of impacts
through conformance with the conditions of approval.
   B.   Conditional Uses Enumerated: Conditional uses are listed in section
9-3-1, table 3-A of this title, and in section
9-5-4, table 5-A of this chapter. If a land use is proposed which is not
provided for within section
9-3-1, table 3-A of this title its status as a permitted or a conditional use
shall be determined by the planning and zoning commission based upon its
similarity and dissimilarity to uses that are listed, particularly with respect
to its visual attributes, its demand for public services and facilities, and
its external impacts or imposition upon adjacent properties (the latter
determined with regard to the permitted uses on that adjacent property. (Ord.
10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-5-2: POLICY:
   A.   The comprehensive plan states in part that the rural atmosphere of the
valleys be protected, that recreation should be encouraged, and that the
economic value of privately owned land be increased.
   B.   This chapter is intended to fulfill those goals and objectives by:
      1.   Defining those uses which are not inherently compatible with the
“permitted uses” defined in chapter 4 of this title.
      2.   Limiting the impact of conditional uses through standards and
procedures.
      3.   Allowing conditional uses in areas and to standards that will
increase the value of privately owned property without undue adverse impact on
the environment, adjoining properties, or governmental services and where
consistent with the county comprehensive plan. In order to achieve these goals,
the maintenance of agricultural uses and low density development will be more
acceptable located on the valley floor; higher density development will be more
acceptable near existing infrastructure and/or developed areas; commercial and
industrial development will be more acceptable in commercial hubs, villages, or
near existing established incorporated communities with similar characteristics
and infrastructure to serve the more intense land use needs.
   C.   The interpretation of the standards and procedures herein shall be to
encourage conditional uses where, in the opinion of the commission,
noncompatible aspects can be satisfactorily mitigated through development
agreements for the costs to service providers, provision for community housing,
site selection, application of technology, design, construction techniques,
topography, landscaping and structure location. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010; amd.

9-5A-4: LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Purpose And General Regulations:
      1.   Introduction:
         a.   This section provides minimum standards for landscaping, walls,
screening devices and lighting so as to promote the general welfare of the
community. This is accomplished by encouraging the creation of an attractive
appearance as well as screening from view any and all uses which may be
unattractive to public view. Landscaping materials, including ground covers,
shrubs and trees not only improve appearance, but also facilitate control of
erosion, reduction of dust and glare, and visually soften building masses.
Additionally, walls and screening devices allow for separation and aid in
buffering incongruous and intense activities. Used together, landscaping,
walls, screening devices and lighting help ensure privacy, aid in promoting
logical land development and enhance property values.
         b.   The county encourages the use of low water plant material in such
a way that a lush appearance is presented. Plant material that is high in
pollen production is discouraged. Also, extreme care should be exercised when
using plants that are known to be poisonous. Noxious weeds shall not be used.
         c.   Plants should be placed in such a way as to maximize
survivability (i.e., low water use plants should not be placed in drainageways,
and the use of frost tender plants should be limited to accent locations, not
primary focal points).
      2.   Definitions:
   CONCEPTUAL LANDSCAPE PLAN: Same as a "landscape plan" as defined in this
subsection, except that shrubs, ground cover and vines may be indicated by
size, quantity, name and general locations on the site.
   LANDSCAPE PLAN: A plan drawn to scale, showing elements such as trees,
shrubs, ground covers, vines, sculptures, walls, lighting, water features,
walkways and other organic and inorganic materials. The plan shall include a
plant list, indicating the size, quantity, location and names of all plant
materials to be used.
   LANDSCAPING: The combination of elements such as trees, shrubs, ground
covers, vines, and other organic and inorganic materials for the express
purpose of creating an attractive and pleasing environment. Public art, water
features, plazas, patios, decorative courtyards and lighting may also be
considered landscape elements. Other paved surfaces are not included in the
minimum requirements.
   MAINTENANCE: Shall include the repair, painting, trimming, pruning, watering
and other ongoing activities that are associated with providing an attractive
site appearance.
   PUBLIC ART: Objects such as sculptures, water features or other
multidimensional designs that would be viewed by the general public as an
attractive amenity in private development. Said objects to be located in spaces
visible and/or accessible to the public in general so as to be enjoyed by the
community at large, and are not to be a business logo.
   SCREENING DEVICE: Any structure intended to fully conceal an activity,
element or mechanical equipment from view, adjacent uses, properties or
streets.
   SITE PLAN: A plan drawn to scale, showing all the uses proposed for a
specific property. The plan shall show all dimensions, buildings, structures,
sign locations, off street parking, loading spaces, points of ingress and
egress, all walls, refuse containers, walkways, all ultimate rights of way
(measured to the centerlines of streets, and alleys), a location map, complete
site data and any additional information which may be necessary to clearly
define the intended use and property lines.
      3.   General Regulations 1 :
         a.   Applicability: The provisions of this subsection A3 shall apply
to all new buildings, all new uses of land, and any addition to existing
buildings and uses requiring a conditional use permit. Maintenance requirements
of this section shall apply to all sites and uses where a conditional use
permit was issued.
         b.   Site Plan And Landscape Plan: The approved site plan and

verify their location is the correct site by demonstration of a sign being
posted by staff.
   D.   Compatibility Rating: The commission may choose to accept the
compatibility rating as prepared by staff or may choose to complete their own
compatibility rating. The commission's ratings may be done at the public
hearing and shall be an average of all the commissioner's values of each

(All times are counted on calendar days.) (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-5H-7: COMMISSION AND PUBLIC HEARING:
   A.   Commission Consideration: The commission shall consider the application
at the date, time and place specified in the advertisement in accordance with
the agenda prepared by the administrator or staff and in accordance with the
rules, procedures, and bylaws adopted by the commission.
   B.   Criteria For Granting: The commission shall grant an application when a
preponderance of the evidence presented to the commission establishes:
      1.   The application and the proposed project is consistent with this
title.
      2.   The proposed project, by its compatibility rating, is shown not to
have any unreasonable negative impacts on adjacent property if all the terms of
the application and/or terms of applicable development agreements are
satisfied.
      3.   The proposed project will not place any unreasonable burden on the
public infrastructure. In the case of an application for a PUD, and, if
directed by the board, the commission shall be entitled to defer the
presentation of evidence regarding, and decisions regarding, this item to the
board.
   C.   Application Tabled: The commission may table the application to a
future specified date when:
      1.   Testimony during the public hearing provides conflicting
information.
      2.   When new information or questions are raised that, in the opinion of
the commission, should be studied by the administrator or staff.
      3.   When a legal opinion or counsel is needed.
      4.   When additional information is needed from the applicant.
   D.   Commission Approval; Recommendation To Board: The commission may

administrator or staff and/or the commission. The commission's approval of a
conditional use permit for a planned unit development shall be a recommendation
to the board of county commissioners who will consider the item at a public
hearing. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-5H-8: ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Minutes Of Proceedings: The administrator or staff shall prepare
minutes of the proceedings for each hearing, including the action taken by the
commission, and forward copies to the members of the commission, the clerk of
the board, and the applicant within ten (10) days after the meeting.
   B.   Issuance Of Permit; Form: Upon recommendation of the commission, the
administrator or staff shall issue a conditional use permit on forms prescribed
by the commission.
      1.   The approval shall be for a period of one year from the date of the
hearing, after which time, the approval will expire and be null and void unless
the applicant has substantially complied with the provisions thereof or has
applied for an extension of time, or the commission has approved a phasing plan
for a longer period. Longer approvals may be given for community service uses,
so long as they phase improvements, such as landscaping. This will allow better
long range planning for utility companies and adjacent property owners.
      2.   The commission may approve extensions for increments of one year or
specified time period with definite benchmarks upon proper application prior to
the expiration of the previous approval. Expiration of the previous approval
will be the date specified on the conditional use permit.
      3.   Applications for extensions shall be reevaluated by the commission
and the fee for a new application charged as set by the board of commissioners.
The application shall summarize the original plan; describe the significant
progress made in accordance with the approved application; explain what has yet
to be completed; and specify an updated completion date. Financial guarantees
will be reevaluated and extended to meet the updated completion date. The
application shall contain an updated list of adjoining property owners and be
noticed in the same manner as a new application. With the extension, impacts
can be reevaluated and mitigated with the addition of new conditions of
approval. A progress report schedule shall be set, with milestones identified.
The commission may choose not to approve an extension based upon their
reevaluation of the proposed use and lack of activity to complete the project.
The extension request is a public hearing. Extensions will not be approved
unless all fees are paid and/or reimbursed to the county.
      4.   Conditional use permits will not be issued until ten (10) days after
the hearing and, in the event an appeal to the board is filed within the ten
(10) days' limitation, the permit will not be issued until after a decision by
the board.
      5.   When the commission's decision is subject to board approval, as for
planned unit developments, the conditional use permit will not be issued until
after the board's decision.
      6.   The permit shall accurately describe the approved use and any
conditions placed on the approval by the commission, including the time for
completion of the work. Occupancy of any part or portion of the approved use
shall not be allowed until all the improvements required to meet the conditions
of approval and related laws and regulations have been satisfactorily
completed. Occupancy may be allowed for a completed portion of the project upon
the posting of a surety for completing the improvements required in the
conditions of approval. The procedure and form of surety shall be in accordance
with section
10-5-3 of this code.
      7.   Record the conditional use permit when issued.
   C.   Appeals: Appeals may be filed, in writing, by any interested party with
the administrator. An appeal of a commission decision on a conditional use
permit will clearly state the decision being appealed, the nature of the
appeal, and how the decision of the commission was not consistent with the
preponderance of the evidence presented. Appeals shall also comply with and be
heard in accordance with section
9-5H-12 of this article.
   D.   Resubmittal: If an applicant fails to appeal a denial within ten (10)
days of the date of the hearing, then a resubmittal may not be made for a
period of one year from the hearing date unless substantial modifications are
made so that the administrator or staff may consider the resubmittal of a new
application. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)

buildings, or other provisions of this title affecting the size or shape of a
structure upon lots, and other land use requirements of this title. In the case
of a PUD involving variations from the requirements of this title, it shall not
be necessary for the applicant to file a separate application for such
variances. Variances may also be heard simultaneously with conditional use
permit applications.

a result from any action of the applicant, which are peculiar to the land use
or structure involved, and which are not applicable to other similar or
adjacent lands, uses, or structures.

characteristics of the site.
         d.   A list of adjoining property owners within three hundred feet

of fact based directly on the particular evidence in the application which
supports the conclusion that the above conditions have been met by the

board need not hold a public hearing, but may make a decision as a regular
agenda item. Only the applicant must be notified as to the time on the agenda
of the public meeting.
      6.   A permit for the variance may be issued by the administrator or
staff only after approval by the board.
      7.   The variance approval is valid for five (5) years, unless a more

record of the proceeding. Such exhibits shall be maintained in the county
planning department during the appeal period, or permanently, if provided as
evidence of future plans. Exhibits offered may be made conditions of approval.
   G.   After the administrator or staff presentation and testimony by the
applicant, the chair shall open the hearing for public testimony and shall
invite the public to address the commission or board in the order of names
found on the sign in roster. If, in the opinion of the chair, the number of
persons testifying is so large as to unduly delay the process of the hearing,
the chair may limit public testimony to three (3) minutes for each member of
the public. Representatives of groups may be limited to five (5) minutes. The
public hearing may be continued, upon motion, to a date certain, which shall be
announced to the public there assembled.

the record, their full name and address.
      1.   Any person desiring to speak must first be recognized by the

the presiding officer may declare such testimony out of order and require it to
cease.

      8.   Public displays shall not be tolerated.
      9.   The chairman may stop the meeting at any time and continue it to a
specified time.

question any person who testified at any time or may, upon a majority of the
members present, ask for further testimony.
   J.   Before the close of the public testimony, the chair shall ask if any
persons attending the hearing who did not sign the roster wish to be heard, and
any such person shall be given the opportunity to testify.
   K.   At the close of public testimony, the chair shall solicit comments from
the administrator or staff for additional testimony or clarifications as the
result of the testimony given. After comments from the administrator or staff,

change in the proposal, further notice and hearing shall be provided before the
commission gives final approval or forwards the proposal with its

   N.   At any public hearing, the commission may order the hearing to be
continued by publicly announcing the time and place of continuance and no
further notice thereof shall be required. Failure of the commission or board to
provide actual notice to each person so entitled shall not render any
proceeding hereunder invalid; provided, that the county substantially complies
with the notice and hearing requirements of this chapter.

CHAPTER 6
SPECIAL AREAS
SECTION:
9-6-1: General Provisions
9-6-2: Flood Prone Areas
9-6-3: Airport Vicinities
9-6-4: Roseberry Townsite Historical Overlay District
9-6-5: Wellhead Protection Overlay District
9-6-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
This chapter defines and contains standards and procedures for special areas
and the use and development of lands therein. The purpose of designating
special areas with greater restrictions is to fulfill the intent of the
comprehensive plan, protect persons and property from potentially hazardous
conditions, indirectly minimize property taxes which may be used to repair such
damages, and to minimize the destruction of resources which are economically,
ecologically, and/or socially important to the county. Since the guidelines for
uses in special areas are supplementary to other regulations, the special areas
are also called overlay districts.
   A.   Special Areas: The following are herein recognized as special areas:
      1.   Flood prone areas: Refer to section
 9-6-2 of this chapter.
      2.   Airport vicinities: Refer to section
 9-6-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
      3.   Roseberry townsite historical overlay district: Refer to section
9-6-4 of this chapter.
      4.   Wellhead protection overlay district: Refer to section
9-6-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010; amd. Ord. 11-5, 6-6-2011)

Idaho" prepared by the federal emergency management agency.
      3.   The airport vicinity for the McCall Airport is currently being
studied.
   C.   Special Area Boundaries And Overlaps:
      1.   The interpretation of the precise location of an overlay district
boundary may be aided by the definition of the "special areas" in section
9-1-10 of this title, supplementary mapping or data obtained by the county or
provided by an applicant disclosing greater detail of the pertinent features of
the special area, and on site inspection of the site by the staff.
      2.   Wherever two (2) or more special areas overlap, all applicable
standards shall apply. When standards conflict or are otherwise incompatible,
the more restrictive shall apply. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-6-2: FLOOD PRONE AREAS:

drainage channels. A large percentage of these areas are fully saturated
seasonally or continuously. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
      2.   Certain flood prone areas have been identified on the "Flood
Insurance Rate Map For Valley County, Idaho" as prepared by the federal
emergency management agency. The applicable maps are identified in title 11 of
this code. The maps are available in the county planning and zoning office or
on the Valley County GIS website. (Ord. 17-03, 2-21-2017)

recorded prior to February 1, 2019; there is no portion of the lot where the
structures can be located outside the identified flood prone area; and, the
structures comply with the applicable standards in subsection D of this
section.
      Structures established prior to February 1, 2019, that are in a flood
prone area, that are destroyed or substantially damaged by extraordinary events
such as fire, earthquake, etc., may be replaced, but shall be in compliance
with title 11 of this Code.

office. Where these zones are located within the city of Cascade, regulations
of that governing entity shall apply.
         a.   Primary Zone: The primary zone is coincident with primary surface
and is centered longitudinally on the runway. When the runway has a specially
prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends two hundred feet (200')
beyond each end of that hard surface; when the runway has no specially prepared
hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of the runway. The primary
zone is two hundred fifty feet (250') wide and the elevation of any point
thereon is the same elevation as that of the nearest point on the runway
centerline. The airport elevation is four thousand seven hundred thirty nine
feet (4,739') above mean sea level. It is the intent of this title for the
zones described herein to automatically extend, in accordance with the
descriptions herein, upon extension or hard surfacing of the runway.

longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of a runway. The
inner edge of the approach surface shall be the same width and elevation as,
and coincides with, each end of the primary surface. The approach surface shall
incline outward and upward at a slope of twenty to one (20:1). The approach
surface shall expand uniformly to width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet
(1,250') and extend horizontally five thousand feet (5,000').
         c.   Transitional Zones: An imaginary surface extending outward and
upward at right angles to the runway centerline and centerline extended at a
slope of seven to one (7:1) from the side of the primary surface and from the
sides of the approach surface until they intersect the horizontal surface of
the horizontal zone.
         d.   Horizontal Zone: An imaginary horizontal surface one hundred
fifty feet (150') above the established airport elevation, four thousand eight
hundred eighty nine feet (4,889') above mean sea level, the perimeter of which
is constructed by swinging acres of five thousand foot (5,000') radii from the
center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the
adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not
include the primary, approach, or transitional zones.
         e.   Conical Zone: An imaginary conical surface extending outward and
upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one
(20:1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000') measured
radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to provide maximum visibility
for safety purposes along roadways, maintain unobstructed views at
intersections and prevent undue distractions to vehicle operators by preventing
confusion at or near traffic signs and signals and along corridors.
   B.   Intent: It is also the intent of this chapter to preserve the rural
character by not allowing flashing, shiny plastics, reader boards or outsize
billboards but to encourage artistic design and creativity through simple
effective signage. Therefore, the intent of this chapter is to promote rural
character and not a city center appearance in the open valleys and open
corridor areas while allowing a village appearance in designated areas.
Furthermore, the intent of this chapter is to require preplanning of select
signage and promote artistic license within the same size limit and similar
location for less confusion and clutter. Signs meeting this intent will act as
a signature block for creative expression but not an advertising billboard.
This chapter contains sign standards for uniform but creative signage. The
pride of ownership and entrepreneurism is encouraged by artistic signage in the
community. Residents and tourists will notice the improvement this makes to the
general appearance of the county. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)

9-9-1: DEFINITION:
A "planned unit development" (hereinafter referred to as a PUD) is an area of
land controlled by one or more landowners, which is to be developed under a
single and comprehensive plan of development. Any mix of residential building
types, or any mix of residential commercial, industrial recreational, and
agricultural uses may be permitted to provide greater flexibility in land
usage. Additional flexibility in development is furnished because setbacks,
height, lot size, density, and other site regulations may differ from those
normally imposed for similar uses. Residential units and other buildings, if
any, may be constructed by either the developer or individual buyers; however,
the application must be accompanied by plans and other documents sufficient for
the administrator, staff and commission to review the application for
compliance with the requirements of this title. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010; amd.
Ord. 11-5, 6-6-2011)
9-9-2: PURPOSE:
The PUD concept allows the site planner to propose the best use and arrangement
of development on the parcel of land by reducing the more rigid regulations
herein. A PUD is designed so that buildings are clustered together to create
open space of common ownership, preserve natural features and landscape
character, more efficiently use the site and to minimize development costs by
sharing common walls, shortening and narrowing roads, and concentrating
utilities. It is expected that a PUD will provide certain amenities like
recreational facilities, landscaping, and natural open spaces for the enjoyment
of all owners, employees, etc., and will demonstrate better than average
quality of development. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-3: PUD REVIEW AND DETERMINATION:
In considering whether to approve a PUD, the commission shall determine:
   A.   That the proposed use nets a positive score on the compatibility rating
system herein. The compatibility rating shall be completed by the commission
and computed for the full application as presented to the commission after
revisions requested during any preliminary review and after the public hearing
is closed;
In the case of PUDs in which the board determines that it is in the public's
interest that the board deal exclusively with certain of the nine (9)
compatibility questions contained in section
9-11-1, appendix A of this chapter, then, subject to the board's direction, the
commission shall not consider such questions as part of its compatibility
rating of the proposed use;
   B.   That the proposal works with the characteristics of the site by
protecting or highlighting attractive features and by minimizing the impact of
development where natural constraints exist;
   C.   That the proposal's layout promotes the clustering and separation of
different kinds of land uses so that both internal compatibility and common
open spaces can be maintained;
   D.   That the proposal's layout and design provides economics in the
provision of roads and other site improvements; and
   E.   That it is more desirable to have a PUD than a subdivision or some
other singular use, and that the PUD is not being proposed simply to bypass or
vary the more restrictive standards required of a subdivision, business,
industry, or other similar use. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-4: TIME FOR COMPLETION:
The proposed development shall be completed within the time specified in the
phasing plan. Extensions may be approved by the commission if it can be shown
as necessary and in the public interest. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-5: CHANGES FROM APPROVED PLANS:
Changes in building design and layout may be approved by the commission if it
can be shown as being necessary or more desirable. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-6: SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
In addition to the items required for a conditional use permit, graphic and
written material shall also be submitted regarding:
   A.   Proposed Setbacks: Proposed front, side, and rear setbacks as different
from those required under normal standards for like uses and any other changes
in similar kinds of standards including, but not limited to, building height,
minimum number of parking spaces per unit, street widths, and lot size.
   B.   Proposed Building Sites: Proposed building sites if these are to be
indicated without, or in addition to, lots, complete with dimensions.
   C.   Common Open Space And Facilities: Common open space and facilities with
conditions for their permanency.
   D.   Phase Of Development; Time Schedule: Phase of development to be shown
geographically and indicating stages in the construction program and time
schedule for progressive completion.
   E.   Outline Of Restrictive Covenants: An outline of the restrictive
covenants expressing key provisions.
   F.   Maintenance Plans: Plans for maintaining roads, parking, and other
areas of circulation, snow removal, snow storage, and any other necessary
upkeep.
   G.   Surface Water Management: Plans for surface water management.
   H.   Other Information: Any other information deemed necessary by the
commission because of the proposed use. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-7: STANDARDS:
   A.   Size: The acreage shall be large enough to accommodate the proposed
PUD.
   B.   Streets, Utilities And Other Site Improvements: Streets, utilities, and
other site improvements shall be made for their later installation, at the
developer's expense, prior to recording the plat. Streets shall be constructed
in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in chapter 5 of this title
and all references made therein if they are to be dedicated to the county.
   C.   Waiver Or Modification Of Specifications, Standards And Requirements:
It is recognized that the uniqueness of each proposal for a PUD requires that
the specifications, standards, and requirements for various facilities,
including, but not limited to: roads, alleys, easements, utilities, signs,
parking areas, storm drainage, water supply and distribution, and sewage
collection and treatment, may be subject to modification from the
specifications, standards, and requirements established for subdivisions and
like uses in this title. The commission may, therefore, at the time of general
submission as requested by the applicant, waive or modify these specifications,
standards, and requirements which otherwise shall be applicable.
   D.   Averaging And Transferring Densities: Averaging and transferring
densities within the PUD shall be allowed: 1) upon a showing that it fits the
definition of a PUD; 2) as long as the overall average residential density is
no greater than six (6) dwelling units per gross acre; and 3) only if
residential units are to be connected to central water and sewer systems. The
overall average residential density shall be calculated by summing the number
of residential dwelling units planned within the boundary of the PUD and
dividing by the total gross area expressed in acres within the boundaries of
the PUD, except public lands. It is recognized that the increased residential
density of a PUD shall be in relationship to the site and structure location,
application of technology, design, construction techniques, landscaping and
topography. Dwelling units per gross acre may be increased to provide community
and workforce housing at negotiated percentages that are memorialized in a
development agreement with the Board of County Commissioners; consideration
will be based upon distance from incorporated cities, impact areas, and
available infrastructure.
   E.   Lot And Building Setbacks: Lot and building setbacks may be decreased
below or otherwise altered from the standards of like uses set forth elsewhere
in this title.
   F.   Maximum Height: The maximum height of buildings may be increased above
those for like uses mandated elsewhere in this title in consideration of the
following characteristics:
      1.   Unreasonable adverse visual effect on adjacent sites or other areas
in the immediate vicinity.
      2.   Potential problems for adjacent sites caused by shadows, loss of air
circulation, or loss of view.
      3.   Influence on the general vicinity with regard to extreme contrast,
vistas, and open space.
   G.   Parking Spaces: The design and construction standards for parking
spaces shall conform to section
9-5A-3 of this title, and the number of parking spaces required may be
increased or decreased relative to the number mandated for like uses elsewhere
in consideration of the following factors:
      1.   Estimated number of cars owned by occupants of dwelling units in the
PUD.
      2.   Parking needs of each specific use.
      3.   Varying time period of use whenever joint use of common parking
areas is proposed.
      4.   Surface parking areas shall not be considered open space for the
purposes of subsection I of this section.
   H.   Internal Street Circulation System: The PUD shall provide an adequate
internal street circulation system designed for the type of traffic generated,
safety, separation from living areas, convenience, and access. Private internal
streets may be narrower than normally required; provided, that adequate access
for police and fire protection and snow removal equipment is maintained.
   I.   Common Open Space: At least fifty percent (50%) of the total area
within the boundary of any residential PUD and twenty percent (20%) of any
commercial or industrial PUD shall be devoted to common open space; provided,
however, that the commission may reduce this requirement if they find that such
a decrease is warranted by the design of, and the amenities and features
incorporated into, the plan and that the needs of the occupants of the PUD for
open space can be met in the proposed development. Each residential unit shall
have ready access to common areas and facilities.
   J.   Materials, Textures And Colors: Harmonious variations in materials,
textures, and colors shall complement and supplement the natural beauty and
pleasant environment of the site and the individual buildings. The site,
design, and construction of all residences shall be planned in such a manner
that there is a substantial resemblance of uniformity.
   K.   Assurances Of Performance Bond: It is recognized that the uniqueness of
each proposal for a PUD requires that the applicant must make adequate
assurances of performance of each phase of the proposal. The commission may
impose any form of bond on those portions of the proposal which will provide
common services to the public or users of the PUD as deemed appropriate by the
commission under the circumstances.
(Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010; amd. Ord. 2023-01, 7-10-2023)

proposal.
   N.   Plans for transporting workers to and from job sites and special
traffic control measures for public safety during and after construction.
   O.   Certain disclosures required by this section will not apply to certain
PUDs because of the uniqueness and small size of the proposal. When disclosures
in subsections B, F, G, H, L, M and N of this section are either not applicable
or not of sufficient importance because the impact of the PUD would be minimal,
the applicant shall include a statement showing why the disclosure does not
apply. Staff shall make a recommendation to the commission as to each
application, and the commission shall decide the applicable procedures. All PUD
applicants shall adequately respond to disclosures in subsections A, C, D, E,
I, J and K of this section. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-9: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
Because of the uniqueness of each proposal, a PUD may impact county services
and/or property which may be mitigated through a development agreement.
Compensation for these impacts shall be negotiated in work sessions with
appropriate county entities and a development agreement shall be entered into
between the applicant and the county through the board as additional conditions
considered for approval of a PUD. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-10: IMPACT FEES:
The commission may recommend to the board impact fees as authorized by Idaho
Code section 31-870 for any PUD proposal. The board may implement the impact
fees as recommended by the commission or as it deems necessary for the
proposal. (Ord. 10-06, 8-23-2010)
9-9-11: REIMBURSEMENT FEES:

CHAPTER 11
APPENDICES
SECTION:
9-11-1: Appendix A, Compatibility Evaluation
9-11-2: Appendix B, Thirty Percent Winter Opacity
9-11-3: Appendix C, Fugitive Dust
9-11-1: APPENDIX A, COMPATIBILITY EVALUATION:
   A.   General: One of the primary functions of traditional zoning is to
classify land uses so that those which are not fully compatible or congruous
can be geographically separated from each other. The county has opted to
substitute traditional zoning with a multiple use concept in which there is no
separation of land uses. Proposed incompatible uses may adversely affect
existing uses, people, or lands in numerous ways: noise, odors, creation of
hazards, view, water contamination, loss of needed or desired resources,
property values, or infringe on a desired lifestyle. To ensure that the county
can continue to grow and develop without causing such land use problems and
conflicts, a mechanism designed to identify and discourage land use proposals
which will be incompatible at particular locations has been devised. The
compatibility evaluation of all conditional uses also provides for evaluations
in a manner which is both systematic and consistent.
   B.   Purpose; Use:
      1.   The compatibility rating is to be used as a tool to assist in the
determination of compatibility. The compatibility rating is not the sole
deciding factor in the approval or denial of any application.
      2.   Staff prepares a preliminary compatibility rating for conditional
use permits, except for conditional use permits for PUDs. The commission
reviews the compatibility rating and may change any value.
   C.   General Evaluation: Completing the compatibility questions and
evaluation (form):
      1.   All evaluations shall be made as objectively as possible by
assignment of points for each of a series of questions. Points shall be
assigned as follows:
         Plus 2 - assigned for full compatibility (adjacency encouraged).
         Plus 1 - assigned for partial compatibility (adjacency not necessarily
encouraged).
         0 - assigned if not applicable or neutral.
         Minus 1 - assigned for minimal compatibility (adjacency not
discouraged).
         Minus 2 - assigned for no compatibility (adjacency not acceptable).
      2.   Each response value shall be multiplied by some number, which
indicates how important that particular response is relative to all the others.
Multipliers shall be any of the following:
         x4 - indicates major relative importance.
         x3 - indicates above average relative importance.
         x2 - indicates below average relative importance.
         x1 - indicates minor relative importance.
   D.   Matrix - Questions 1 Through 3: The following matrix shall be utilized,
wherever practical, to determine response values for questions one through
three (3). Uses classified and listed in the left hand column and across the
top of the matrix represent possible proposed, adjacent, or vicinity land uses.
Each box indicates the extent of compatibility between any two (2) intersecting
uses. These numbers should not be changed from proposal to proposal, except
where distinctive uses arise which may present unique compatibility
considerations. The commission shall determine whether or not there is a unique
consideration.
   E.   Terms:
   DOMINANT ADJACENT LAND USE: Any use which is within three hundred feet
(300') of the use boundary being proposed; and
      1.   Comprises at least one-half (1/2) of the adjacent uses and one-
fourth (1/4) of the total adjacent area; or
      2.   Where two (2) or more uses compete equally in number and are more
frequent than all the other uses, the one with the greatest amount of acreage
is the dominant land use; or
      3.   In all other situations, no dominant land use exists. When this
occurs, the response value shall be zero.
   LOCAL VICINITY: Land uses within a one to three (3) mile radius. The various
uses therein should be identified and averaged to determine the overall use of
the land.
   F.   Questions 4 Through 9:
      1.   In determining the response values for questions 4 through 9, the
evaluators shall consider the information contained in the application, the
goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan, the provisions of this title
and related ordinances, information gained from an actual inspection of the
site, and information gathered by the staff.
      2.   The evaluator or commission shall also consider proposed mitigation
of the determined impacts. Adequacy of the mitigation will be a factor.

the presence of such dust remains visible in the atmosphere beyond the boundary
line of the emission source.
      2.   Visible Emissions From Active Operations: A person shall not cause
or allow fugitive dust by active operations, open storage piles, or disturbed
surface areas, such that the fugitive dust is of such opacity as to obscure an
observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than does smoke as dark or
darker in shade designated as no. 2 on the Ringelmann chart (i.e., 40 percent
opacity), as published by the United States bureau of mines.
      3.   Concentrations Limit: A person shall not cause or allow PM10 levels
to exceed fifty (50) micrograms per cubic meter, twenty four (24) hour average,
when determined by simultaneous sampling, as the difference between upwind and
downwind samples collected on high volume particulate matter samplers or other
EPA approved equivalent method for PM10 monitoring. Sampling shall be conducted
in accordance with the procedures specified in this subsection.
   F.   Minimum Dust Control Requirements: The following dust mitigation
measures are to be initiated at the start and maintained throughout the
duration of the mining construction or grading activity, including any
construction or grading for road construction or maintenance:

kept wet, treated with a chemical dust suppressant, or paved.
      2.   The speed of any vehicles and equipment traveling across unpaved
areas must not be more than fifteen (15) miles per hour unless the road surface
and surrounding area is stabilized to prevent vehicles and equipment traveling
more than fifteen (15) miles per hour from emitting dust exceeding Ringelmann
2, or visible emissions, from crossing the project boundary line.
      3.   Storage piles and disturbed areas not subject to vehicular traffic
must be stabilized by being kept wet, treated with a chemical dust suppressant,
or covered when material is not being added to or removed from the pile.
      4.   Prior to any ground disturbance, including grading, excavating, and
land clearing, sufficient water must be applied to the area to be disturbed to
prevent emitting dust exceeding Ringelmann 2 and to minimize visible emissions
from crossing the boundary line.

9-12-2: Definitions
9-12-3: Zoning Classifications
9-12-4: Permit Requirement
9-12-5: Permit Application
9-12-6: Issuance Of Permit
9-12-7: Site Design And Installation
9-12-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide, through zoning provisions, for the
reasonable development of land for oil and gas drilling while providing
adequate health, safety and general welfare protections of the Valley County
residents. Oil and gas exploration, drilling and extraction operations involve
activities that are economically important and will impact Valley County.
Accordingly, it is necessary and appropriate to adopt reasonable requirements
for oil and gas resource development so that these resources can be obtained in
a manner that is economically remunerative, and that minimizes the potential
impact on the residents of Valley County.
Local governments are preempted from regulating the same features of oil and
gas well operations or accomplishing the same purposes regulated under Idaho
statutes 47-317. Local zoning regulates surface land use as authorized under
the local land use planning act 1 . (Ord. 13-5, 9-16-2013)

9-12-7: SITE DESIGN AND INSTALLATION:
   A.   Access:
      1.   Vehicular access to a natural gas well, oil well or well pad solely
via a residential street is prohibited unless it can be proven that the only
viable vehicular access to the well site is via the residential route. The use
of collector streets is preferred.
      2.   Valley County's adopted professional standards pertaining to minimum
traffic sight distances for all access points shall be adhered to.
      3.   Access directly to state roads from a well site may require an Idaho
transportation department (ITD) approach permit. Prior to initiating any work
at a drill site, the Valley County planning and zoning department shall be
provided a copy of the required approach permit.
      4.   Access directly to Valley County local streets shall require a
Valley County road repair agreement prior to initiating any work at a well
site. Operator shall comply with any generally applicable bonding and
permitting requirements for Valley County roads that are to be used by vehicles
for site construction, drilling activities and site operations.
   B.   Height:
      1.   There shall be an exception to the height restrictions contained in
this section for the temporary placement of drilling rigs, drying tanks, pad
drilling and other accessory uses necessary for the actual drilling or
redrilling of an oil or gas well. The duration of such exemption shall not
exceed the actual time period of drilling or redrilling of an oil or gas well
or pad drilling.
   C.   Setbacks/Location:
      1.   Setback distances shall, at minimum, follow requirements listed in
the IDL rules governing oil and gas conservation or a minimum of two hundred
feet (200') from property lines.
      2.   Recognizing that the specific location of equipment and facilities
is an integral part of the oil and gas development, and as part of the planning
process, operator shall strive to consider the location of its temporary and
permanent operations, where prudent and possible, so as to minimize
interference with Valley County residents' enjoyment of their property and
future Valley County development activities as authorized by the Valley County
applicable ordinances.
      3.   Exception from the standards established in this subsection may be
granted by Valley County upon good cause by the operator that it is not
feasible to meet the setback requirements from surface tract property lines and
that adequate safeguards have or will be provided to justify the exception.
   D.   Screening And Fencing:
      1.   Security fencing shall not be required at oil or gas well sites
during the initial drilling, or redrilling operations, as long as manned twenty
four (24) hour on site supervision and security are provided.
      2.   Upon completion of drilling or redrilling in residential or
commercial zones, security fencing consisting of a permanent chainlink fence
shall be promptly installed at the oil or gas well site to secure wellheads,
storage tanks, separation facilities, water or liquid impoundment areas, and
other mechanical and production equipment and structures on the oil or gas well
site.
      3.   Valley County may use its discretion to determine whether fencing
requirements shall be enforced for wellheads, storage tanks, separation
facilities, and other mechanical and production equipment and structures on the
oil or gas well site in those zones.
      4.   Security fencing shall be at least six feet (6') in height equipped
with lockable gates at every access point and having openings no less than
twelve feet (12') wide. Additional lockable gates used to access oil and gas
well sites by foot may be allowed, as necessary.
      5.   Warning signs shall be placed on the fencing surrounding the oil or
gas well site providing notice of the potential dangers and the contact
information in case of an emergency. During drilling and hydraulic fracturing,
clearly visible warning signage must be posted on the pad site.
      6.   In construction of oil or gas well sites, the natural surroundings
should be considered and attempts made to preserve existing trees and other
native vegetation. Existing trees and respective root systems should not be
disturbed whenever possible. Reforestation/revegetation of the well site will
be provided by the owner/operator as required by rules governing oil and gas
conservation.
   E.   Lighting:
      1.   Lighting at the oil or gas well site, either temporary or permanent,
shall be directed downward and inward toward the activity, to the extent
practicable, so as to minimize the glare on public roads and adjacent
properties.
   F.   Noise:
      1.   Valley County recognizes that oil and gas development is accompanied
by inherent noise. However, the operator shall consider, to the extent
possible, mitigation of noise resulting from the oil or gas well development.
   G.   Dust Control:
      1.   Operator shall control fugitive dust control arising from
operations. Operator shall dustproof work area by sprinkling with water or a
water/calcium chloride mixture where necessary.
   H.   Work Hours:
      1.   Site development, other than drilling, shall be conducted only
between seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. Monday through
Friday and nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on Saturday.
Truck deliveries of equipment and materials associated with drilling and, well
servicing, site preparation and other related work conducted on the site shall
be limited to the above same work hour restrictions except in cases of an
emergency. The operator may request an exception to this section for good cause
shown. (Ord. 13-5, 9-16-2013)

CHAPTER 7
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FIRE PROTECTION PLAN
SECTION:
10-7-1: Purpose
10-7-2: Definitions
10-7-3: Basis For Recommendation
10-7-4: Submission Requirements
10-7-1: PURPOSE:
Valley County's community wildfire protection plan acknowledges that wildfire
hazard areas exist throughout the county. Therefore, wildfire mitigation
actions are prudent to enable safe habitation in these fire environments. The
Valley County fire working group recommends that a requirement for the
development and approval of a wildland urban interface fire protection plan be
added as an addendum to the Valley County subdivision regulations ordinance.
The existence of said plan will assist the Valley County planning and zoning
commission and the structural fire districts in satisfying the current
subdivision regulation, subsection
10-3-2-6D7 of this title. (Ord. 10-07, 8-26-2010)
10-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
   APPROVED: Refers to approval as the result of review, inspection or tests by
reason of accepted principles.
   ASPECT: Generally refers to the direction to which a mountain slope faces.
For example: A slope that faces the sun in the afternoon has a westerly aspect
or is a west facing slope.
   DEFENSIBLE SPACE: Refers to that area between a building and an oncoming
wildfire where the vegetation has been modified to reduce the wildfire threat
and to provide an opportunity for firefighters to effectively defend the
building.
   FORESTED: Idaho Code title 38, chapter 1 (Idaho forestry act) defines
"forestland" as meaning "any land which has upon it sufficient brush or
flammable forest growth of any kind or size, living or dead, standing or down,
including debris or growth following a fire or removal of forest products, to
constitute a fire menace to life (including animal) or property".
   FUEL BREAK: An area, strategically located for fighting anticipated
wildfires, where the vegetation has been modified or removed so that fires
burning into it can be more easily controlled. Fuel breaks may divide fire
prone areas into smaller areas for easier fire control and to provide access
for firefighting.
   PROFESSIONAL: Can include qualified professional forester, fire ecologist,
or comparable experience. Professionals can be prequalified by the commission
or recommended by the Valley County fire working group and kept on record at
the planning and zoning office.
   PROFESSIONAL FORESTER: An individual holding at least a bachelor of science
degree in forestry from an accredited four (4) year institution. (This is
consistent with Idaho state tax commission rule 960 of the Idaho administrative
code, Idaho state tax commission, PDAPA 35.01.03, section 04.)
   SLOPE: The variation of terrain from the horizontal; the number of feet of
rise or fall per one hundred feet (100') measured horizontally, expressed as a
percentage.
   STRUCTURE: That which is built or constructed, an edifice or building of any
kind or any piece of work artificially built up or composed or parts joined
together in some manner.
   VALLEY COUNTY FIRE WORKING GROUP: This group is given charter by the Valley
County board of commissioners and is tasked with oversight of the community
wildfire protection plan. This group is represented by local fire departments,
SITPA, public land managers (USFS, IDL, BOR), bureau of homeland security, West
Central Highlands RC&D, Valley County Natural Resource Consultants, etc.
   WILDFIRE: An uncontrolled fire spreading through vegetative fuels, exposing
and possibly consuming structures.
   WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREA: That geographical area where structures and
other human development meets or intermingles with wildland or vegetative
fuels. (Ord. 10-07, 8-26-2010)
10-7-3: BASIS FOR RECOMMENDATION:
Valley County adopted the 2006 international fire code, which references the

FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
11-1-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose, And Objectives
11-1-2: Definitions
11-1-3: General Provisions
11-1-4: Administration
11-1-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
11-1-6: Legal Status Provisions
11-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   Statutory Authority:
      1.   The legislature of the State of Idaho, pursuant to Idaho Code
sections 46-1020, 46-1023, and 46-1024, authorizes local governments to adopt
floodplain management ordinances that identify floodplains and minimum
floodplain development standards to minimize flood hazards and protect human
life, health, and property. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Valley
County, Idaho, does hereby ordain the following provisions.
      2.   Section
9-6-2, "Flood Prone Areas", of this Code contains an overlay that should be
used in conjunction with this title.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of Valley County are subject to periodic
inundation that results in:
         a.   Loss of life and property;
         b.   Health and safety hazards;
         c.   Disruption of commerce and governmental services;
         d.   Extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and
protection; and
         e.   Impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas,
which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      3.   Local government units have the primary responsibility for planning,
adopting, and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain
management.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life, health, and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      7.   Ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   D.   Objectives And Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish
its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
      1.   Require that development which is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Preserve and restore natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which carry and store floodwaters. (Ord. 19-03, 1-
7-2019)
11-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted according to the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE): A structure on the same lot or
parcel as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental and subordinate
to the principal structure.
   ADDITION (To An Existing Building): An extension or increase in the floor
area or height of a building or structure.
   APPEAL: A request for review of the Floodplain Coordinator's interpretation
of provisions of this chapter or request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one foot (1') to three feet
(3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of special flood hazard area
(SFHA).
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): A determination by the Federal Insurance
Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the
flood level that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of occurrence in any
given year. When the BFE has not been provided in a special flood hazard area,
it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or
other source using FEMA-approved engineering methodologies. This elevation,
when combined with the freeboard, establishes the flood protection elevation.
   BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BUILDING: See definition of structure.
   CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that are vital to flood response activities
or critical to the health and safety of the public before, during, and after a
flood, such as a hospital, emergency operations center, electric substation,
police station, fire station, nursing home, school, vehicle and equipment
storage facility, or shelter; and facilities that, if flooded, would make the
flood problem and its impacts much worse, such as a hazardous materials
facility, power generation facility, water utility, or wastewater treatment
plant.
   DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points)
from which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of
points was the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical
datum currently adopted by the Federal government as a basis for measuring
heights is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
   DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
   DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any activity defined as development which will
necessitate a floodplain development permit; such as: the construction of
buildings, structures, or accessory structures; additions or substantial

community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community are delineated.
   ELEVATED BUILDING: For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The Elevation Certificate is an important
administrative tool of the NFIP. It is used to determine the proper flood
insurance premium rate; it is used to document elevation information; and it
may be used to support a request for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter
of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
   ENCLOSURE: An area enclosed by solid walls below the BFE/FPE or an area
formed when any space below the BFE/FPE is enclosed on all sides by walls or
partitions. Insect screening or open wood lattice used to surround space below
the BFE/FPE is not considered an enclosure.
   ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation,
buildings, structures, or development into a floodplain, which may impede or
alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING STRUCTURES: See definition of existing construction.
   FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION: See definition of base flood elevation (BFE).
   FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY: See definition of Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which
the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard

of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations;
or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING: A. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
      3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding
as defined in subsection A2 of this definition and are similar to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when
earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   B.   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in subsection A1 of this definition.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The base flood elevation plus the
freeboard.
   A.   In "special flood hazard areas" where base flood elevations (BFEs) have
been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet (2') of
freeboard; and
   B.   In "special flood hazard areas" where no BFE has been established, this
elevation shall be at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes dams,
reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   FLOOD ZONE: A geographical area shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area, and applicable
insurance rate.
   FLOODPLAIN COORDINATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations. Also referred to as "Administrator".
   FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: Any type of permit that is required in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the commencement of
any development activity.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control
ordinance), and other applications of police power. The term describes such
State or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
   FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effects of urbanization in a watershed. The base flood elevation
(BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the flood protection elevation (FPE).
Freeboard shall be two feet (2').
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A facility that cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such
as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo
or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair facilities. The term does not
include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

   A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered Historic
District or to a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify
as a registered Historic District;
   C.   Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1.   By an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
      2.   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC): A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F).
      Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies
with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to
delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS). Upon
submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. Building
permits and/or flood development permits cannot be issued based on a CLOMR,
because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
      Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) map. A LOMA establishes a
property's or structure's location in relation to the special flood hazard area
(SFHA). LOMAs are usually issued because a property or structure has been
inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain but is actually on natural high
ground above the base flood elevation.
      Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA's modification to an effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of
physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a
flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory
floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood
hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and when
appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally
accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM or FIS
report.
      Letter Of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the
special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. The
LOMR-F does not change the FIRM or FIS report.
   LEVEE: A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed according to sound engineering practices, to contain, control, or
divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to
the structure. Refer to the FEMA Elevation Certificate for LAG related to
building elevation information.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR section 60.3 and this
chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built
on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE: The building value, not including the land value and that of
any accessory structures or other improvements on the lot. Market value may be
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated
for age of building and quality of construction (actual cash value); or
adjusted tax assessed values.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum (such as
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 - NAVD88) to which base flood elevations
(BFEs) shown on a community's FIRM are referenced.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW): Describes a condition where there is a river,
flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A
mudslide (i.e., mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide
is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Administrator only if the
mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   MUDSLIDE (i.e., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes
of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
created by Congress to mitigate future flood losses nationwide through sound,
community-enforced building and zoning ordinances and to provide access to
affordable, Federally backed flood insurance protection for property owners.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, a structure for which
the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
Any construction started after September 5, 1990, and before the effective
start date of this chapter is subject to the ordinance in effect at the time
the permit was issued, provided the start of construction was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of permit issuance.
   POST-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred on or after the effective date of the initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   PRE-FIRM: Construction or other development for which the "start of
construction" occurred before September 5, 1990, the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis, and
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, and
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY: See definition of floodway.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its non-compliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE: A NFIP-insured structure that has had at least
two (2) paid flood losses of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each in
any 10-year period since 1978.
   RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard
area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBDIVISION: Any division of land.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
See definition of "substantial improvement".
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure" and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to this
chapter.
   TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND TECHNICAL FACT SHEETS: FEMA publications that
provide guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP,
which are contained in title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations section
60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by State and
local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and
by members of the development community, such as design professionals and
builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued
periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations. Rather they
provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of
existing NFIP regulations.
It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact sheets provide
guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or
community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design
professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more
restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or site in
question. All applicable standards of the State or local Building Code must
also be met for any building in a flood hazard area.
   TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED: Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or
cooling system, built-in or appliance.
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Governing Body from a requirement of this
chapter.
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Finished Construction Elevation Certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988 (or other specified datum), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur. (Ord. 19-03, 1-7-2019; amd. Ord. 21-08, 6-28-2021)

its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisoned for not more than one hundred eighty
(180) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Valley County, Idaho
from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. 19-03, 1-7-2019)
11-1-4: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of Administrator: The Planning and Zoning Administrator,
hereinafter referred to as the "Floodplain Coordinator", is hereby appointed to
administer and implement the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Coordinator: The
Floodplain Coordinator shall perform, but not be limited to, the following
duties:
      1.   Review all floodplain development applications and issue permits for
all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      2.   Review all proposed development within special flood hazard areas to
assure that all necessary local, State, and Federal permits have been received,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 USC 1334.
      3.   Notify adjacent communities and the Idaho Department of Water
Resources State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA). (This is the
LOMC procedure.)
      4.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      5.   Prevent encroachments into floodways unless the certification and
flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection
11-1-5E of this chapter are met.
      6.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor (including basement) and all attendant utilities of all new
and substantially improved structures, in accordance with the provisions of
subsection C3 of this section.
      7.   Obtain and maintain actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
to which all new and substantially improved structures and utilities have been
floodproofed, in accordance with the provisions of subsection C3 of this
section.
      8.   Review plans to verify all public utilities reconstructed in
accordance with the provisions of subsections
11-1-5A5 through A7 of this chapter.
      9.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
and maintain certifications from a registered professional engineer or
architect in accordance with the provisions of subsections C3 of this section
and
11-1-5B2 of this chapter.
      10.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, or floodways (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this section.
      11.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
11-1-3B of this chapter, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data,
along with floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source,
including data developed pursuant to subsection
11-1-5C2 of this chapter, in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
      12.   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway
data has been provided in accordance with the provisions of subsection
11-1-3B of this chapter require that no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
community. (This is a Hydraulic and Hydrology Analysis.)
      13.   When the lowest floor and the lowest adjacent grade of a structure
or the lowest ground elevation of a parcel in a special flood hazard area
(SFHA) is above the base flood elevation (BFE), advise the property owner of
the option to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA. Maintain a
copy of the LOMA issued by FEMA in the floodplain development permit file.
      14.   Permanently maintain all records that pertain to the administration
of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection,
recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended.
      15.   Make on-site inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant
to a floodplain development permit progresses, the Floodplain Coordinator shall
make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the
work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the
terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the Floodplain Coordinator has a
right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within
the jurisdiction of the community at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action.
      16.   Issue stop-work orders as required. Whenever a building or part
thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this chapter, the Floodplain Coordinator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to
the person doing or in charge of the work. The stop-work order shall state the
specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) for the stoppage, and the
condition(s) under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work
order constitutes a misdemeanor.
      17.   Revoke floodplain development permits as required. The Floodplain
Coordinator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development
permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the
revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to
comply with the requirements of State or local laws; or for false statements or
misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable State or local law may
also be revoked.
      18.   Make periodic inspections throughout the special flood hazard areas
within the jurisdiction of the community. The Floodplain Coordinator and each
member of his or her Inspections Department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
      19.   Follow through with corrective procedures of subsection D of this
section.
      20.   Review, provide input, and make recommendations for variance
requests.
      21.   Maintain a current map repository to include, but not limited to,
the FIS Report, FIRM and other official flood maps, and studies adopted in
accordance with the provisions of subsection
11-1-3B of this chapter, including any revisions thereto including Letters of
Map Change, issued by FEMA. Notify the NFIP State Coordinator and FEMA of the
community's mapping needs.
      22.   Coordinate revisions to FIS reports and FIRMs, including Letters of
Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-Fs) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs).
      23.   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator
(FIA) of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance
with this chapter. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.
      24.   Upon occurrence, notify the Federal Insurance Administrator (FIA)
in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by
annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In
order that all FHBMs and FIRMs accurately represent the community's boundaries,
include within such notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for
which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      25.   Determine if Valley County should hire a licensed engineer to
review any information provided. If a licensed engineer is required it shall be
at the expense of the applicant.
   C.   Floodplain Development Application, Permit, And Certification
Requirements:
      1.   Application Requirements: Application for a floodplain development
permit shall be made to the Floodplain Coordinator prior to any development

Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Coordinator a certification of final
as-built construction of the elevation of the lowest floor and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Coordinator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as- built construction. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of
a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy.
The Finished Construction Elevation Certificate certifier shall provide at
least two (2) photographs showing the front and rear of the building taken
within ninety (90) days from the date of certification. The photographs must be
taken with views confirming the building description and diagram number
provided in subsection A of the elevation certificate. To the extent possible,
these photographs should show the entire building including foundation. If the
building has split-level or multi-level areas, provide at least two (2)
additional photographs showing side views of the building. In addition, when
applicable, provide a photograph of the foundation showing a representative
example of the flood openings or vents. All photographs must be in color and
measure at least 3" x 3". Digital photographs are acceptable.

used to meet the flood protection elevation requirements, a Floodproofing
Certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan,
and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start
of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to
the Floodplain Coordinator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation
of the lowest floor and all attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea level.
Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The
Floodplain Coordinator shall review the certificate data, the operational plan,
and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to submit
the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to
deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance with
the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a Certificate
of Compliance/Occupancy.
         c.   Manufactured Home: If a manufactured home is placed within Zone
A, AE, AH, AO, or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than thirty
six inches (36") in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification

      4.   Determinations For Existing Buildings And Structures: For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, improvements, repairs of
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
the Floodplain Coordinator, in coordination with the building official, shall:
         a.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made;
         b.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
         c.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and
         d.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the adopted
Idaho Building Code and this chapter is required.
   D.   Corrective Procedures:
      1.   Violations To Be Corrected: When the Floodplain Coordinator finds
violations of applicable State and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law cited in such
notification.
      2.   Actions In Event Of Failure To Take Corrective Action: If the owner
of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Coordinator shall give the owner written notice, by certified or
registered mail to the owner's last known address or by personal service,
stating:
         a.   That the building or property is in violation of the floodplain
management regulations;
         b.   That a hearing will be held before the Floodplain Coordinator at
a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
         c.   That following the hearing, the Floodplain Coordinator may issue
an order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
applicable.
      3.   Order To Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Coordinator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall issue
an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within a specified time period, not less than sixty (60) calendar days, nor
more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. Where the Floodplain
Coordinator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he
or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may
be feasible.
      4.   Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take corrective
action may appeal the order to the local elected Governing Body by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Coordinator and the Clerk within
ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an
appeal, the order of the Floodplain Coordinator shall be final. The local
Governing Body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm,
modify and affirm, or revoke the order.
      5.   Failure To Comply With Order: If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no appeal has
been made or fails to comply with an order of the Governing Body following an
appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished at the
discretion of the court.
   E.   Variance Procedures:
      1.   The Valley County Board of Commissioners as established by Valley
County, hereinafter referred to as the "Appeal Board", shall hear and decide
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Variances may be issued for:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
         b.   Functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the
definition as stated in section
11-1-2 of this chapter, provided provisions of subsections E9b, E9c, and E9d of
this section, have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety; or
         c.   Any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements
of this section.
      3.   In passing upon variances, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;

factors in subsections E3a through E3k of this section with their application
for a variance.
      5.   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this
chapter.
      6.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
      7.   The Floodplain Coordinator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the State of Idaho upon request.

11-1-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all special flood hazard areas the following
provisions are required:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed
(or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in
accordance with the Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials
Requirements, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      3.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
      4.   All new and replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding to the flood protection elevation.
These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units,
bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable
boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches.
      5.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
      6.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      7.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      8.   A fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially
improved structures, and used solely for parking, access or storage, which is
below the lowest floor shall:
         a.   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to
the flood protection elevation; and
         b.   Include, in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, flood openings to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed
the following minimum design criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (2)   The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (3)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and
exit;
            (4)   The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the interior or exterior adjacent grade;
            (5)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
            (6)   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
      9.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
      10.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction,
or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date hereof
and located totally or partially within the floodway, or stream setback,
provided there is no additional encroachment below the flood protection
elevation in the floodway, or stream setback, and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this
chapter.
      11.   New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not
be permitted, except by variance as specified in subsection
11-1-4E9 of this chapter. A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage
incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or
wastewater treatment facility may be located in a special flood hazard area
only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least
the flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions
of subsection
11-1-4C3 of this chapter.
      12.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and determined to be
reasonably safe from flooding.
      13.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
      14.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
      15.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall
have received all necessary permits from those governmental agencies for which
approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
      16.   All subdivision proposals and other development proposals greater
than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include
within such proposals base flood elevation data.
      17.   When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard
area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and
substantial improvements.
      18.   When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a
flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for
the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood
elevation (BFE) shall apply.
      19.   Fill is prohibited in the SFHA, including construction of buildings
on fill. However, it does not include construction of bridges and/or other
necessary structures for transportation from one side of the floodplain to the
other so long as there is no adverse impact to adjacent properties. This
includes not approving Conditional Letters or Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR-
F or LOMR-F).
   B.   Specific Standards: In all special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in subsection
11-1-3B of this chapter, or subsection D of this section, the following
provisions, in addition to the provisions of subsection A of this section, are
required:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than the flood
protection elevation, as defined in section
11-1-2 of this chapter.
      2.   Non-Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non- residential structure
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than the
flood protection elevation, as defined in section
11-1-2 of this chapter. Structures located in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-30
may be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation
provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, below the flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AH and AO Zones, the floodproofing
elevation shall be in accordance with subsection F2 of this section. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification
shall be provided to the Floodplain Coordinator as set forth in subsection
11-1-4C3 of this chapter, along with the operational plan and the inspection
and maintenance plan.
      3.   Manufactured Homes:
         a.   New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that
the lowest floor of the manufactured home is no lower than the flood protection
elevation, as defined in section
11-1-2 of this chapter.
         b.   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either
by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the Idaho Division of Building Safety's "Idaho Manufactured
Home Installation Standard" in accordance with Idaho Code section 44-2201(2).
Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis
thirty six inches (36") or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above thirty six inches (36") in height, an engineering
certification is required.
         c.   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the
requirements of subsection B4 of this section.
         d.   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Coordinator and the
local Emergency Management Coordinator.
      4.   Additions/Improvements:
         a.   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to
the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more non-conforming than the existing structure; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         b.   Additions to non-compliant post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications to the existing structure other
than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to
comply with the standards for new construction.
         c.   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM non-compliant
structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any
interior modifications to the existing structure are:
            (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction; or
            (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and
the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.
         d.   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a ten
(10) year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building
or structure, the ten (10) year period begins on the date of the first
improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective
date hereof. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are
considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:
            (1)   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions;
or
            (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      5.   Recreational Vehicles: Recreational vehicles shall be for temporary
placement only. Temporary placement shall be on site for fewer than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days, between May 1 and November 30 each year, and be
fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for

cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
community.
   E.   Standards For Floodways: Areas designated as floodways are located
within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
11-1-3B of this chapter. The floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the
velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards
outlined in subsections A and B of this section, shall apply to all development
within such areas:
      1.   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other developments shall be permitted unless:

Areas designated as shallow flooding areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of one foot (1') to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to subsections A and B of this
section, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
following requirements:
      1.   The lowest floor shall be elevated at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a
freeboard of two feet (2'), above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four
feet (4') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
      2.   Non-residential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection F1 of this section so
that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required in accordance with subsection
11-1-4C3 of this chapter, and subsection B2 of this section.
      3.   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 19-

unit shall be fitted to the terrain with a minimum
disturbance of the land. Existing trees, rock           X     X     X     X
formations, and other natural site features shall be
reserved to the extent practicable. Favorable views or
outlooks should be emphasized by the plan.
Arrangements Of Structures And Facilities: The site,
including mobile home or trailer stands, patios,
structures, and all site improvements shall be
harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to
topography, the shape of the plot, and the shape, size  X     X     X     X
and position of structures and common facilities and
with full regard to use, appearance and livability.
Special attention should be given to new mobile home
and trailer designs and the common appurtenances that
are available.
Community Facilities: Community facilities and other
needed uses not classified as a residential use should
be appropriately located with respect to the population
to be served. Residential units should be separated or  X     X     O     O
insulated from areas of heavy traffic noise, commercial
and industrial activities and should merge with parks
and other suitable open areas and community facilities.
Drives, Carports And/Or General Parking Areas: Location
of drives, carports and/or general parking areas should
be appropriately related to the unit and other areas of
the lot. Ease and safety of ingress and egress to each
lot and convenience of access to the mobile home or     X     X     X     X
trailer must be considered. Desirable views from the
unit should not be blocked by drives or parking spaces,
nor should drives and parking spaces break up important
use areas of the lot or adjoining lots.
General: Site planning should adapt to individual site
conditions, type of market to be served, reflect
advances in site planning techniques and be adaptable
to the trends in design of the mobile home or trailer,  X     X     X     X
itself. An informal park type of site planning which
conforms to the natural terrain, existing trees and
shrubs and rock formations is preferred. Adoption of a
stylized pattern should be avoided.
Groupings Or Clusters: Groupings or clusters of units
which fit well together and provide neighborliness and  X     X           
attractive interior areas but yet provide a
separateness about each unit should be encouraged.
Methods Of Groupings: Blocks, cul-de-sacs, clusters,

14-1-4:   Findings
14-1-5:   Purpose
14-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
This title shall be known and may be cited as the Valley County Development
Impact Fee Ordinance.
(Ord. 2024-01, 10-16-2023)
14-1-2: AUTHORITY:
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to Valley County’s general police powers and
its authority to enact ordinances as set forth in Article XII, Section 2 of the
Idaho Constitution and section 31-714, Idaho Code, its authority as provided by
the Act and other applicable laws of the state of Idaho to impose and collect
development impact fees on behalf of the County; and on behalf of certain
districts pursuant to the County’s authority to enter into intergovernmental
agreements as provided for in section 67-8204A, Idaho Code when jointly
affected by growth and development. (Ord. 2024-01, 10-16-2023)
14-1-3: APPLICABILITY:
This title shall apply to the Development of property located within the
unincorporated area of Valley County.
Except as otherwise exempted in section 14-8-1, this title shall apply to the
Development of property located within the unincorporated area of Valley
County, Idaho.
(Ord. 2024-01, 10-16-2023)
14-1-4: FINDINGS:
   A.   The County is experiencing considerable growth and Development; and
   B.   The purposes of the Act [I.C. § 67-8202] are as follows:
      1.   Ensure that adequate Public Facilities are available to serve new
growth and Development; and
      2.   Promote orderly growth and Development by establishing uniform
standards by which local governments, such as the County, and any District with
which the County has entered into an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to
I.C. § 67-8204A, may require those who benefit from new growth and Development
pay [development impact fees] their Proportionate Share of the costs of new
Public Facilities needed to serve that new growth and Development; and
      3.   Establish minimum standards for adoption of development impact fee
ordinances by cities; and
      4.   Ensure that those who benefit from new growth and Development are
required to pay no more than their Proportionate Share of the cost of Public
Facilities needed to serve that new growth and Development and to prevent
duplicate and ad hoc Development Requirements; and
      5.   To empower counties to adopt ordinances to impose development impact
fees.
   C.   The Act does not authorize any District to enact a development impact
fee ordinance; and
   D.   The Act does provide, pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A, in circumstances
where the County and any District are both affected by the considerable growth
and Development, that the County and any district with which the County has
entered into an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A may
enter into the Intergovernmental Agreement for the purpose of agreeing to
collect and expend development impact fees for System Improvements which
provides for a new funding mechanism for those System Improvements Costs
incurred by any district with which the County has entered into an
Intergovernmental Agreement to meet the demand and growth occurring within the
unincorporated area of the County and which promotes and accommodates orderly
growth and Development and protects the public health, safety and general
welfare of the residences within the unincorporated area of the County; and
   E.   New growth within the County imposes and will impose increasing and
excessive demands upon the existing, capital facilities of the County and of
any district with which the County has entered into an Intergovernmental
Agreement pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A; and
   F.   New growth within the County is expected to continue, and will place
ever-increasing demands on the County, and any district with which the County
has entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A, to
provide and expand capital facilities to serve that new growth; and
   G.   The tax revenues generated from new Development within the
unincorporated area of the County often do not generate sufficient funds to
provide the necessary improvements and expansion of existing County, and any
district with which the County has entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement
pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A, to accommodate for that new growth; and
   H.   Section 67-8204A of the Act authorizes the County to adopt an impact
fee system and to enter into the Intergovernmental Agreements to offset,
recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to capital
facilities caused by new growth and Development within the unincorporated area
of the County; and
   I.   The creation of an equitable impact fee system facilitated by the
Intergovernmental Agreements, will promote the purposes set forth in the Act,
in that it would: (a) ensure that adequate Capital Facilities are available to
serve new growth and Development; (b) promote orderly growth and Development by
establishing uniform standards by which the County may require that those who
benefit from new growth and Development pay a Proportionate Share of the cost
of new Capital Facilities needed to serve new growth and Development in the
unincorporated area of the County; (c) establish minimum standards for the
adoption of impact fees; (d) ensure that those who benefit from new growth and
Development are required to pay no more than their Proportionate Share of the
cost of Capital Facilities needed to serve new growth and Development; and (e)
prevent duplicate and ad hoc Development Requirements in the unincorporated
area of the County; and
   J.   The Capital Improvements Plans contain the Capital Improvements planned
for by the District during the term of the Capital Improvements Plan, and such
elements have been developed in conformance with the requirements Chapter 82 of
Title 67, Idaho Code; and
   K.   The Capital Improvements Plans set forth reasonable methodologies and
analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new Development on the
capital facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the
improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities created by new
Development; and
   L.   In accordance with Idaho Code, the Capital Improvements Plan was based
on actual System Improvements Costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. In
addition, the Capital Improvements Plan uses a fee calculation methodology that
is net of credits for the Present Value of revenues that will be generated by
new growth and Development based on historical funding patterns and that are
anticipated to be available to pay for System Improvements, including taxes,
assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers; and
   M.   The development impact fees established by this title are based on the
Capital Improvements Plan, and do not exceed System Improvements Costs to serve
new Development that will pay the Impact Fees; and
   N.   The capital facilities, included in the calculation of fees in the
Capital Improvements Plans, will benefit all new residential Development
throughout the service area identified for purposes of calculating, collecting,
and spending the Impact Fees collected from Developers; and
   O.   There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between
Development impacts created by each type of Development covered by this title,
the development impact fees assessment of such Development covered by this
title, and the development impact fees that such Developer will be required to
pay; and
   P.   This title creates a system by which development impact fees paid by
Developers will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the costs
incurred by the County, and any district with which the County has entered into
an Intergovernmental Agreement pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A, to construct and/or
purchase System Improvements in ways that benefit the Development for which
each development impact fee was paid within a reasonable period of time after
the development impact fee is paid, and in conformance with I.C. § 67-8210; and
   Q.   This title creates a system under which development impact fees shall
not be used to correct existing deficiencies for any Capital Facilities, or to
replace or rehabilitate existing Capital Facilities, or to pay for routine
operation or maintenance of those facilities; and
   R.   This title creates a system under which there shall be no double
payment of development impact fees, in accordance with I.C. § 67-8204(19); and
   S.   This title is consistent with all applicable provisions of the Act
concerning development impact fee ordinances.
(Ord. 2024-01, 10-16-2023)
14-1-5: PURPOSE:
   A.   This title is adopted to be consistent with, and to help implement the
Capital Improvements Plan.
   B.   The intent of this title is to ensure that new Development bears a
Proportionate Share of the cost of System Improvements; to ensure that such
Proportionate Share does not exceed the cost of such System Improvements
required to accommodate new Development; and to ensure that funds collected
from new Development are used for System Improvements in accordance with the
Act.
   C.   It is the further intent of this title to be consistent with those
principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of System Improvements to
new Development, and for adopting development impact fee ordinances,
established by the Act.
   D.   It is not the intent of this title to collect any money from any new
Development more than the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for
System Improvements created by such new Development.
   E.   It is the intent of this title that any monies collected, as imposed
Impact Fees, are deposited in the appropriate Impact Fees Capital Projects
Trust Fund account, are never commingled with monies from a different impact
fee account, are never used for a development impact fee component different
from that for which the fee was paid, are never used to correct current
deficiencies in any district’s, with which the County has entered into an
Intergovernmental Agreement pursuant to I.C. § 67-8204A, Capital Facilities,
and are never used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain or operate any Capital
Facilities.

Impact Fees are determined by the approved Capital Improvement Plan and shall
not exceed a Proportionate Share of the cost of the System Improvements
determined in accordance with I.C. § 67-8207, as amended. Impact Fees shall be
based on actual System Improvements Costs or reasonable estimates of such
costs. The amounts of the Impact Fees shall be calculated using the methodology
contained in the Capital Improvements Plan which complies with the following:
   A.   Based on a reasonable and fair formula or method under which the Impact
Fees imposed do not exceed a Proportionate Share of the costs incurred or to be
incurred by the County or a District, as the case may be, in the provision of
System Improvements to serve the new Development. The Proportionate Share is
the costs attributable to the new Development after the consideration of the
following:
      1.   Any appropriate credit, offset or contribution of money, dedication
of land or construction of System Improvements; and
      2.   Payments reasonably anticipated to be made by or as a result of a
new Development in the form of user fees and debt service payments; and
      3.   That portion of general tax or other revenues allocated by a
District to System Improvements; and
      4.   All other available sources of funding such System Improvements.
   B.   In determining the Proportionate Share of the cost of System
Improvements to be paid by the Developer, the following factors shall be
considered by the County or a District, as the case may be, and accounted for
in the calculation of the Impact Fees:
      1.   The costs of existing System Improvements within the Service Area;
and
      2.   The means by which existing System Improvements have been financed;
and
      3.   The extent to which the new Development will contribute to System
Improvements costs through taxation, assessments, or Developer or landowner
contributions, or has previously contributed to System Improvements costs
through Developer or landowner contributions; and
      4.   The extent to which the new Development is required to contribute to
the cost of existing System Improvements in the future; and
      5.   The extent to which the new Development should be credited for
providing System Improvements, without charge to other properties within the
Service Area; and
      6.   Extraordinary Costs, if any, incurred in serving the new
Development; and
      7.   The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of
fees paid at different times; and
      8.   The availability of other sources of funding System Improvements
including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies,
intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation.
   C.   Levels of service. Impact Fees shall be calculated on the basis of
levels of service for Public Facilities adopted in this title that are
applicable to existing Development as well as new growth and Development. The
construction, improvement, expansion or enlargement of new or existing Public
Facilities for which the Impact Fees are imposed must be attributable to the
capacity demands generated by the new Development.

not to unreasonably delay the Developer’s (Fee Payer’s) subsequent applications
to the County for Building Permits.
   D.   Each individual assessment request delivered to the Administrator may
then be accepted, rejected, or accepted with modifications by the Administrator
as the basis for calculating the Impact Fee. The criteria for acceptance,
rejection, or acceptance with modifications shall be whether the individual
assessment is a more accurate measure of demand for System Improvements Element
(s) created by the proposed Development, or the costs of those facilities, than
the applicable fee shown in the fee schedule attached to the Capital
Improvements Plan.
   E.   The decision by the Administrator on an application for an individual
assessment shall include an explanation of the calculation of the Impact Fee,
shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the Impact Fee is intended to
be used, and shall include an explanation of those factors identified in I.C. §
67-8207.
   F.   If an individual assessment is accepted or accepted with modifications
by the Administrator, then the Impact Fee due under this title for such
Development shall be calculated according to such individual assessment.
   G.   The Administrator shall provide notice of final determination of an
individual assessment to the Developer (Fee Payer).

EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS
SECTION:
14-10-1: Extraordinary Impact Determinations
14-10-1: EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT DETERMINATIONS:
Determinations of Extraordinary Impacts are made as follows:
   A.   The Administrator shall review and determine whether the Development
application will impose Extraordinary Impact.
   B.   If the Administrator determines that a proposed Development generates
Extraordinary Impact that will result in extraordinary Systems Improvements
Costs, the Administrator will notify the Fee Payer of their determination
within thirty (30) days after Administrator’s receipt of the Development
application. Such notice shall include a statement that the potential impacts
of such Development on System Improvements are not adequately addressed by the
Capital Improvements Plan, and that a supplemental study, at the Fee Payer’s
expense, will be required.
   C.   Circumstances that may lead to a determination of Extraordinary Impact
include, but are not limited to an indication that the assumptions used in the
Capital Improvements Plan underestimate the level of activity or impact on
Capital Facilities from the proposed Development or activity.
   D.   Within thirty (30) days following the designation of a Development with
Extraordinary Impact, the Administrator shall meet with the Fee Payer to
discuss whether the Fee Payer wants to:
      1.   Pay for the supplemental study necessary to determine the System
Improvements Costs related to the proposed Development; or
      2.   Modify the proposal to avoid generating Extraordinary Impact; or
      3.   Withdraw the application for certification, Building Permit, or
Development.
   E.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay for the supplemental study required to
document the proposed Development’s Proportionate Share of System Improvements
Costs, then the County or the District, as the case may be, and the Fee Payer,
shall jointly select an individual or organization acceptable to both to
perform such study. The Fee Payer shall enter into a written agreement with the
individual or organization to pay the costs of the study. Such agreement shall
require the supplemental study to be completed within thirty (30) days of such
written agreement unless the Fee Payer agrees to a longer time.
   F.   Once the study has been completed, the Fee Payer may choose to:
      1.   Pay the Proportionate Share of System Improvements Costs documented
by the supplemental study; or
      2.   Modify the proposed Development to reduce such costs; or
      3.   Withdraw the application.
   G.   If the Fee Payer agrees to pay the System Improvements Costs documented
in the supplemental study, that agreement shall be reduced to writing between
the County or the District, as the case may be, and the Fee Payer, prior to
review and consideration of any application for any Development or Building
Permit related to the proposed Development.
   H.   Notwithstanding any agreement by the Fee Payer to pay the Proportionate
Share of System Improvements Costs documented by the supplemental study,
nothing in this ordinance shall obligate the County or a District to approve
Development that results in an Extraordinary Impact to the County or a
District, as the case may be.

shall issue a credit, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
against the Impact Fees otherwise due for the same Capital Improvements Element
in connection with the proposed Development, as set forth in this section.
Credit shall be issued regardless of whether the contribution or dedication to
System Improvements was required as a condition of Development or was offered
by the Developer and accepted by the County or the District, as the case may
be, in writing, and regardless of whether the contribution or dedication was
contributed by the Developer or by a local improvement district controlled by
the Developer.

the Fee Payer.
   B.   Improvements. Credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of
System Improvements shall be valued by the County or a District, as the case
may be, at the Present Value of such improvements based on complete engineering
drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates as submitted by the
Fee Payer. The Administrator shall determine the amount of credit due based on
the information submitted, or, if it determines that such information is
inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs
acceptable to the County or a District, as the case may be, as a more accurate
measure of the value of the offered System Improvements.

case may be, a written offer of request to dedicate specific parcels of
qualifying land or a written offer to contribute or construct specific System
Improvements to the Capital Facilities in accordance with all applicable state
and local governmental design and construction standards, and shall
specifically request a credit against the type of impact fee for which the land
dedication or System Improvements is offered. The County or a District, as the
case may be, shall then deliver the written offer of request to the
Administrator.
   B.   Review. After receipt of the written offer of request for credit, the
Administrator shall review the request and determine whether the land or System
Improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing Capital
Facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If the
Administrator determines that the offered credit satisfies those criteria and
will be acceptable to the County or the District Commissioners, as the case may
be, then the credit shall be issued. The review and determination of a written
offer/application for credit shall be completed by the Administrator within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a written offer and application for credit.

pursuant to sections above exceeds the Impact Fees that would otherwise be due
from the Fee Payer pursuant to this title (whether calculated through the fee
schedule attached to the capital improvement plan or through an independent
assessment), the Fee Payer may choose to receive such credit in the form of
either:
      1.   A credit against future County or a District’s Impact Fees due for
the same System Improvements; or
      2.   A reimbursement from Impact Fees paid by future Development that
impacts the System Improvements contributed or dedicated by the Fee Payer.
Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the Fee Payer, the County, or the
District, as the case may be, shall be under no obligation to use any of its
funds other than Impact Fees paid by other Development for the same System
Improvements to reimburse the Fee Payer for any credit in excess of the Impact
Fees that are due.
   D.   Written agreement required. If credit or reimbursement is due to the
Fee Payer pursuant to this section, the County or a District, as the case may
be, shall enter into a written agreement with the Fee Payer, negotiated in good
faith, prior to the contribution, dedication, or funding of the System
Improvements giving rise to the credit. The agreement shall provide for the
amount of credit or the amount of time and form of reimbursement, and shall
have a term not exceeding ten (10) years.
   E.   The Administrator’s determination on the written offer of request for
credit shall be provided to the Fee Payer and the County or the District
Commissioners, as the case may be.

meeting and review the proposal and make a recommendation to the Board of
County Commissioners within sixty (60) days of receiving a complete application
by staff.
   A.   Review Criteria - The application shall be evaluated on the following
criteria:
      1.   The total contiguous acreage of the land is at least five (5) acres
in size and is and has been actively devoted to agricultural or forest
production for the last three (3) consecutive years,
      2.   Viability of the proposed APA lands for continued use for
agricultural or forest production,
      3.   The Applicant’s plan for continuity of operation over the 20-year
designation period,

      6.   Proximity to planned transportation corridors or future public
rights of way,
      7.   Proximity to planned airport expansion or development,
      8.   Proximity to planned development with existing entitlements,
      9.   Agricultural production capability of the land within the proposed
APA, and
      10.   Other local impacts relevant to the proposed APA.
   B.   Additional Conditions - Notwithstanding the criteria and review process
outlined in this chapter, the Board of County Commissioners may place
additional conditions on lands designated as an APA, including, but not limited
to, setbacks from existing public rights of way, setbacks from existing public
structures, and a review of the land’s APA designation after twenty (20) years.
   C.   Memorialize Decision - Once the APA commission makes its recommendation
to the Board of County Commissioners, the Board of County Commissioners shall
hold a public hearing and issue its decision within 60 days of a
recommendation. Failure to make a decision shall render the APA commission’s
recommendation final. The Board of County Commissioner’s decision shall include
Findings of Facts supporting its decision. The decision shall be memorialized
as follows:
      1.   Record the designation of an APA, a legal description of the area,
and any findings of fact with the County recorder within ten (10) days;
         a.   Findings of Fact should include the description.

condition that the APA designation transfers with the land.
      2.   Update County land use planning maps to delineate the APA in
Appendix B of the Comprehensive Plan in order to reflect the boundaries of the
APA:
         a.   Update will be through recordation of a resolution approved by
the Board of County Commissioners.
         b.   This change shall not be an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan
but an inclusion to the maps that can be changed more frequently.

approval.
      3.   Notify relevant public officials and agencies of the designation.

writing to the APA Commission. The APA Commission shall make a recommendation
to the Board. The Board of County Commissioners shall acknowledge receipt of
the request for removal in writing confirming the removal date as ten (10)
years from the date of the written request for removal, or upon expiration of
the designation, whichever is sooner.

time with approval from the Board of County Commissioners for the following
reasons and it must be memorialized with an amended document that is recorded
and with changes to the planning maps:

that are associated with the agricultural production activity in the APA.
      2.   In order to establish multi-generational houses or employee houses
for the agricultural operations.
   C.   A landowner wishing to terminate an APA for a hardship must request in
writing a meeting with the Board of County Commissioners. The meeting request
shall include a proof of hardship. The request and proof of hardship should be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department. Early termination of the APA
shall only occur if the landowner is able to establish a hardship as defined in
this chapter. (Ord. 2025-01, 12-12-2024)
15-1-10: ENROLLMENT DURATION AND REVIEW:
Twenty (20) year, or a specifically designated longer duration, after the
creation of an APA, if the landowner desires to continue with the APA, no
action on the part of the landowner is necessary and the APA shall
automatically renew for another twenty (20) years. If the landowner desires to
terminate the agricultural protection area, written notice to the Board of
County Commissioners is required to be submitted to both the County Clerk and
Planning and Zoning Board at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of
the APA. Failure to meet the initial termination deadline shall constitute
hardship for purposes of requesting an early termination of the APA during any
automatic renewal period. (Ord. 2025-01, 12-12-2024)
