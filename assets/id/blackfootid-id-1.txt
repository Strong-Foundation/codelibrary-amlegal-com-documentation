subdivisions, as part of the public right of way or separate easement, as may
be specified in an overall bicycle plan as adopted by the city council when
identified by a relevant master plan.
   E.   Installation Of Public Utilities: Underground utility facilities are
required.
   F.   Driveways: All driveway openings in curbs shall be as specified by the
public works department, highway district or state highway department.
   G.   Storm Drainage: An adequate storm drainage system shall be required in
all subdivisions. The requirements for each particular subdivision shall be
established by the city council. Construction shall follow the specifications
and procedures established by the city council.
   H.   Public Water Supply And Sewer Systems: All public water supply or sewer
systems (serving 2 or more separate premises or households) shall be
constructed in accordance with any adopted local plans and specifications. All
new public water supply or sewer systems shall be an extension of an existing
public system whenever possible. In the event that the proposed public water
supply or sewer system is not an extension of an existing public system, there
shall be a showing by the subdivider that the extension is not feasible and not
to the best interest of the public. Idaho Code section 50-1326 requires that
all water and sewer plans be submitted to the state department of environmental

   I.   Maintenance And Operation Of Public Water Supply And Sewer Systems: The

   K.   Street Name Signs: Street name signs shall be installed in the

   N.   Street Lighting: Streetlights shall be installed throughout the
subdivision. A subdivider shall conform to the requirements of the city and the
public utility providing such light. (2003 Code § 12-08-02)
   O.   Secondary Water Systems For Irrigation: The delivery of irrigation
water shall be executed in accordance with Idaho Code section 31-3805 and the
following:
      1.   The use of the city's potable water supply as the primary source of
irrigation water in all new developments shall be prohibited. For purposes of
this subsection, the term "new development" means any new subdivision or any
development of any parcel of land of three-fourths (3/4) of an acre or larger
that is not part of a subdivision. The existence of a secondary water system
for irrigation within a subdivision does not prohibit the use of municipal
water services for irrigation when the secondary water system is not reasonably
available or operational.
      2.   All new developments shall include an operating pressure irrigation
system constructed to city standards and approved by the city engineer. There
shall be no cross connections allowed between the irrigation system and the
city's domestic water system. The city engineer shall encourage developers to
participate in a regional system as long as the pump station is operational
before the first building permit is issued for that station's service area.
      3.   The city may assume ownership and responsibility for the
development, maintenance, repair, and any associated costs involved with the
secondary irrigation water system. When ownership is assumed, the city will
administer these systems as separate enterprise funds within the city's water
department, assessing only those charges necessary to maintain and operate the
specific systems developed. These charges will include all necessary and
appropriate charges from irrigation entities.
      4.   The city engineer may authorize in specific cases a variance from
the requirement of a pressure irrigation system, if not contrary to the public
interest. where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this subsection would result in unnecessary hardship. In order to
qualify for a variance the following information must be provided for
consideration:
a. A letter from the irrigation district, company, or other purveyor of water
explaining the difficulties, expense, or other issues with supplying the
development secondary water; and
b. Information verifying whether or not the development has viable access to
surface water; and
c. An irrigation study may be required to confirm that a secondary water system
is not reasonably available or operational in relation to the size of
development; and
d. Anytime surface water is not available, a feasibility study will be required
for the use of municipal water services for irrigation; and

8-5-1: PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY:
This chapter is adopted for the purpose of providing uniform street name and
address number grid systems, and for proper administration and enforcement of
these systems. This chapter shall apply to all lands within the city. (2003
Code § 8-02-01)
This chapter is adopted with the intent to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of all residents within the city, especially in the context of
efficient emergency dispatch considerations. To achieve this purpose, the City
shall coordinate closely, through the Planning & Zoning Administrator, with
representatives of the Addressing Committee and the Planning & Zoning
Committee. This collaboration will ensure the implementation and maintenance of
a fair and uniform street naming and address numbering grid system.
Furthermore, the City shall establish procedures for making necessary
corrections and for the effective administration and enforcement of these
systems. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands located within
the city limits.
 
8-5-2: DESIGNATION OF STREET NAMES:
There hereby is established in the city the following rules and regulations of
the naming of streets. The street names presently in place and previously
passed by the city council hereby are established. Thereafter, all new streets
shall be established in accordance with the same general standards hereinafter
set forth and made a part of the official street name list.
   A.   Standards: The following standards shall be used in determining or
approving street names:
      1.   Duplication Of Names Prohibited: There shall be no duplication of
street names by sound or spelling within any address numbering grid system
area. Differentiation shall not be by the addition of suffixes such as "road",
"street", "lane", etc. Street and road name duplications may be permitted only
where the streets involved are situated within two (2) or more separate
addressing grid system areas, when it can be determined that such duplication
will not cause confusion or jeopardize the public safety.
      2.   Future Street Dedications: Names for future street dedications shall
be suggested by the person or agency proposing the street dedication, subject
to all provisions of this chapter. The planning and zoning commission shall
determine what constitutes a separate street.
 
3. Prefixes: Directional prefixes will only be used in conjunction with Grid
Streets.
(i.e., East Bridge).
      3 4.   Suffixes: Each approved street name shall require a street suffix.
Only one (1) street suffix will be allowed per street name. Directional
suffixes may only be allowed in conjunction with Grid Streets. All street
suffixes will be abbreviated in compliance with the United States Postal
Addressing Standards. The following suffixes shall be used in designating
street names:
         a.   Street: An east-west right of way generally running in a straight
line that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties, the
dedication of which has been legally accepted, except streets in existence at
this date.
         b.   Avenue: A north-south right of way generally running in a
straight line that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent
properties, the dedication of which has been legally accepted, except avenues
in existence at this date.
         c.   Drive: A right of way generally meandering in an east-west
direction that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties,
the dedication of which has been legally accepted.
         d.   Way: A right of way generally meandering in a north-south
direction that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties,
the dedication of which has been legally accepted.
         e.   Court: An east-west dead end street connecting to a drive or
street at one end only and at the other end providing a cul-de-sac with a
radius of forty five feet (45') at the face of curb to the center of the
circle.
         f.   Place: A north-south dead end street connecting to a drive or
street at one end only and at the other end providing a cul-de-sac with a
radius of forty five feet (45') at the face of curb to the center of the
circle.
         g.   Lane: A private street, officially accepted as such, but not
maintained by the city or the county. Its acceptance is based upon an
application request and approval. Any private lane that has two (2) or more
addresses must be officially named.
         h.   Boulevard: Normally eighty foot (80') or greater right of way
which provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties, the
dedication of which has been officially accepted by the city or county and
which is separated by a median strip, usually landscaped.
         i.   Road: A designated major arterial which extends to both urban and
rural areas, dedicated and maintained by the city or county.
j. Loop: A secondary thoroughfare that returns to the same originating road.
      3 5. COMPONENT ORDER: Components of a street address shall always be in
the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), street name,
directional suffix (if any), and street type, designation of apartment or
suite, and apartment/suite number.
      4  6.   Circle Or Dead End Streets: Five (5) platted lots or less coming
immediately off of any right of way shall carry the suffix "circle" after the
name of the street from which it emerges and shall be numbered according to the
grid of such street. Short dead end streets with five (5) or less addresses,
coming immediately off of a road of arterial or collector status, may also be
designated as "circles" and carry the name of the streets from which they
emerge, if such dead end streets will not or cannot be extended and provided
with their own names in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      5 7.   Existing Names; Preference: Where the proposed street is on the
same alignment, and is a continuation of an existing street, the name of the
existing street shall be applied. Where a street is on the same alignment but
is not linked to an existing street, the planning and zoning commission shall
designate a name, giving preference to existing names.
      6 8.   One Designation: Where a proposed street dedication unites two (2)
differently named streets located on the same alignment, the planning and
zoning commission shall designate one of the existing names.
      7 9.   Prefixes: Streets may be given the prefix "north", "south", "east"
or "west" if they cross address numbering grid system baselines.
      8 10.   Change In Direction: If a street makes a very obvious change in
direction, a new street name shall be assigned. Whenever this situation occurs,
the change of street name should occur at an intersection rather than the point
where the direction changes.
   B.   Private Streets:
      1.   Official List: Officially accepted private streets (lanes) shall be
listed on an official street name list with the accompanying designation of
"private". Applications for private street names must be made to and approved

existing street names, public or private.
      2.   Street Signs:
         a.   The city shall make, install and maintain street signs on private
streets at approved locations. The financial obligations for the sign or signs

have signs indicating its name and status as "private".
   C.   Subdivisions:
      1.   Shown On Plats: Proposed subdivision street names shall be shown on
preliminary and final subdivision plats when submitted to the planning and
zoning commission. The commission shall not approve such plats until the street
names have been checked against the official street name map and list.

be named in accordance with the definitions here noted.
      3.   Overall Theme: Subdividers shall be encouraged to use an overall
theme when naming their streets.

to determine what name is to be used when two (2) or more streets are in
alignment.
      5.   Plat Approval: No plat shall be approved by the city council for
filing until all provisions of this chapter have been complied with. Approval
of a final plat for filing in the county recorder's office shall constitute
acceptance of all street names shown thereon.
      6.   Street Signs: It shall be the responsibility of any subdivider
dedicating a new street to finance street name signs at each and every
intersection.
   D.   Changes In Street Names:
 1. ADDRESS COMMITTEE: The City’s Address Committee shall be comprised of one
representative from each of the following agencies: City Council, City Utility

concerning public health, safety, and welfare as it relates to addressing.
      1 3.   Reasons For Change: Where necessary or desirable,
applications recommendations from the Addressing Committee may be made to the
commission to change a street name, or the commission may do so at its
discretion, for reasons of duplication, similar pronunciation or spelling, or
for other reasons relating to public safety or convenience.
      2 4.   Commission Determination: In the case of street name changes
necessitated due to duplication, similar pronunciation or spelling, the
commission shall determine the street to be changed and select the new name to
be used. In so doing, the commission shall take into consideration the number
of existing addresses on the streets in question, the length of time each
street has used the name in question, the date of the original dedication of
said streets and any other factors pertinent to the changes in question. The
commission may hold public hearings on such changes.
      3 5.   Check With Official Map And List: No street names may be changed
until the proposed ones have been checked with the official street name map and
list.

so as to create the least possible inconvenience to residents and property
owners in the area. No change shall become effective for at least thirty (30)
days after official action by the commission.

A. Address Grid: The Blackfoot Address Grid comprises the following
characteristics and is so defined in order to establish and maintain
consistency in addressing standards within the City of Blackfoot.
1. The city of Blackfoot road system exists in two general orientations:
a. The downtown original blocks area where North/South Axis roads are oriented
at approximately North 40 degrees East, and East/West Axis roads are oriented
at approximately North 50 degrees West; and
b. Roads that are aligned in a predominately orthogonal (true north)
orientation outside the downtown blocks. Roads that run North and South, and
Northeast and Southwest shall be treated the same, and roads that run East and
West, and Northwest and Southeast shall be treated the same.
2. Origin – The North/South axis is defined as the Union Pacific Railroad, and
the East/West axis is defined as West and East Bridge Streets.
3. Extents – The extent of the Blackfoot Address Grid shall be the city limits
and shall dynamically evolve as annexations occur to include said annexed
areas. Note: This rule implies that former county addresses shall be made to
conform to the city address grid once they are annexed into the city.
4. Interval – Whereas the original downtown blocks were created as 350’ x 350’
on average, these are used as the precedent throughout the city as being 100
addresses per 350’ feet.
5. Parity – Structures on northerly and westerly sides of roads shall be
addressed as Odd, while structures along the easterly and southerly sides of
roads shall consistently be addressed as even throughout the entirety of the
address grid.

multiple access doors on a single building, or as ordered by the fire chief or

3-2016, eff. 5-3-2016)

Exhibit “A”
12-2-2: PREAPPLICATION:
   A.   Submit Preliminary Plat: Prior to submittal of a subdivision
application, the developer shall submit Six (6) copies (1) digital copy and,
for commercial developments only, (1) hard copy of a preliminary plat plan to
the site plan review committee.
   B.   Review Scheduled: The city engineer shall schedule and hold the
preliminary site plan review within thirty (30) days from the submittal date,
unless the developer agrees to additional time.
   C.   Review: A preliminary site plan review allows the developer an
opportunity to meet with municipal staff and other representatives deemed
appropriate by the city engineer. A representative of the various public works
departments shall be invited to all preliminary site plan review meetings.
Items to be reviewed:
      1.   The general subdivision process.
      2.   Overall design, lot sizes and street layout.
      3.   Preliminary utility design.
      4.   Conformity to the comprehensive plan.
      5.   Potential off site impacts/mitigation.
      6.   Off site/on site improvements.
   D.   Additional Review: Additional preliminary site plan review may be
scheduled by the city engineer when, in the collective judgment of staff, the

preliminary site plan review shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of
submittal unless the developer agrees to additional time.
   E.   Written Report: At the conclusion of the preliminary site plan review
process, the city engineer shall provide the developer with a written site plan
review report, which includes a statement of issues, concerns and
recommendations deemed important by the city staff based upon the level of
information available at the time of preliminary site plan review. The site
plan review report allows the developer to submit an application for
subdivision review. A site plan review report states that the proposed
subdivision has been reviewed by appropriate staff and agencies and is eligible
to submit an application and does not constitute an approval in any way. Such
notice may include comments, concerns and recommendations of the staff and
participating agencies.
   F.   Validity; Extension: A site plan review report is valid for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days. The city engineer may extend the duration of

conditions of the preliminary site plan review have not changed materially.
After expiration of a site plan review report, the developer shall be required
to resubmit for a preliminary site plan review.

It shall be unlawful to maintain a mobile home or travel trailer for
residential purposes outside a mobile home park or in a mobile home subdivision
(R2T) previously titled R2-T or MDR2 zone. Such prohibition shall apply
regardless of whether the parking site shall be on private or public premises,
streets, alleys or highways. Mobile homes used for residential quarters for
watchmen or caretakers and located on the premises of an industrial
establishment in any industrial zone may be permitted by a conditional use
permit. (2003 Code § 11-05-04)
11-6A-6: OTHER CONDITIONAL USE APPROVALS:
There are certain conditional uses that require consideration of additional
approval criteria unique to the specific application. In reviewing such
applications, the Planning and Zoning Commission must consider the standards of
approval set forth for each conditional use described below in addition to the
general criteria and findings set forth for conditional use permits in
subsection 11-6A-4M of this article. An application and fee are required for
each request in accordance with sections 11-3-2 and 11-3-3 of this title. (Ord.
2164, 12-5-2017)

   8.   General Childcare Requirements:
      a.   Provide a minimum on site outdoor play area of one hundred (100)
square feet per child. This area requirement may be waived or modified if
appropriate open space with connecting public sidewalks or paths are located
near the facility and that open space can be used by the children as a play
area; or the program of the facility is such that the size of a group of
children using the play area at any one time conforms to the one hundred (100)
square feet per child criteria. This criteria may also be met by safely
transporting students to an approved outdoor play area.
      b.   Provide a minimum of thirty five (35) square feet of indoor gross
play area per child.
      c.   Secure and maintain a childcare license from the State (for

of the City Building and Fire Department, and the County health inspector.
      e.   Provide as a minimum, one off street parking space per employee.
      f.   Provide for an on-site child pick up area if located on a collector

area, screening and setbacks.
      h.   An application fee set by the City Council and amended from time to
time by resolution, shall be paid with the submittal of an application.
   9.   Standards: The Zoning Administrator/building official may also require
the following standards to protect adjacent properties from adverse impacts or
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children:
      a.   Fencing or landscape screening of the facility to protect adjacent
properties from activities of the facility, or to protect the children from
adverse activities such as traffic on arterial or collector streets, at
intersections or to screen adjacent properties; or
      b.   Additional setbacks to play areas from property line to protect
adjacent properties or to protect children from busy streets, irrigation
ditches, animal pastures and other similar conflicts; or
      c.   Any other conditions deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator/
building official to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children, or
to protect adjacent property owners from adverse impacts. (Ord. 2164, 12-5-
2017)
   10.   Adult Daycare Standards: Adult daycare has different use
characteristics from other allowed uses and therefor requires additional
standards to be determined by the Zoning Administrator/building official:
         a.   There shall be adequate access for physically handicapped patrons
of the facility.
         b.   If located on an arterial or collector street, provide for an on
site patron pick up area designed to prevent vehicles from backing onto street
(backing into alley is permissible).
         c.   The use shall meet the occupancy requirements of the city
building and fire departments.
         d.   All applicable licenses must be obtained from the city or the
state.
         e.   An application fee set by the city council and amended from time
to time by resolution, shall be paid with the submittal of an application.
   C.   Drive-Up Windows: No drive-up window establishment shall be permitted
unless the planning and zoning commission finds that the design and operation
of the establishment is substantially in compliance with the following
requirements and conditions that shall be in addition to those required in
section 11-6A-4 of this article:
      1.   The location of the establishment shall not cause an increase of
commercial traffic in nearby residential neighborhoods, increase general
traffic congestion where serious congestion problems already exist, or cause
other significant adverse impacts on public or private property in the vicinity
of the site. The advice of the appropriate transportation authority shall be
solicited for the purpose of evaluating existing and projected levels of
service and the effects of projected turning movements on highway safety; and
      2.   The internal circulation on the site provides for pedestrians to
walk from parking lots to the lobby entrances without traversing the waiting
lanes for the drive-up window; and
      3.   The waiting lanes be of sufficient length to provide for anticipated
average monthly peak volumes; and
      4.   The design, signage or operational characteristics of the
establishment prevent or discourage vehicles from waiting for service on public
sidewalks or streets; and
      5.   Drive-in waiting lanes be designed so that curbs, gates or other
devices do not prevent a vehicle from leaving a waiting lane; and
      6.   All lights and other illuminated materials shall be designed,
positioned, shielded, directed and located to prevent glare from falling on
adjoining properties. Screening of lights may be required as a secondary
measure of mitigation. Illumination levels shall not exceed two (2) foot-
candles as measured one foot (1') above the ground at property lines shared
with residentially zoned or used parcels; and
      7.   The drive-up window service does not constitute the entire
establishment. This finding may be waived upon showing that the public interest
would be better served if the drive-up window service does constitute the
entire establishment; and
      8.   The design, operation and sign characteristics of the project will
attempt to minimize air pollution and wasteful consumption of fuel. Required
mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Prohibiting all parking spaces that are in addition to the
minimum number of parking spaces required by this title; and
         b.   Retention of existing desirable trees for reasons of species,
location, health, age or other reason as determined and recommended by the city
engineer; and
         c.   Maximum placement of landscaped areas and trees; and
      9.   Landscaping shall screen drive-up aisles from the public right of
way and shall be used to minimize the visual impact of vehicular lights, reader
board signs and directional signs; and
      10.   Drive-through lanes shall be set back at least ten feet (10') from
adjacent residentially zoned or used property. This buffer shall include both
coniferous trees and sound abatement walls; and
      11.   Any drive-up window establishment that is within three hundred feet
(300') of a residential use or zone, as measured along the shortest distance
between the nearest residential property line and any part of the drive-up
portion of the land use, shall not be permitted to utilize outdoor order
speakers; use of a handheld phone or an order window shall be required; and
      12.   In accordance with section 11-6A-4 of this article, the planning
and zoning commission has the authority to limit the hours of operation, and
may impose such restrictions on drive-up window establishments.
   D.   Adult Bookstore, Adult Motion Picture Theater, Adult Performance
Business Or Adult Entertainment Establishment:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of these regulations is to protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city, to
protect the health, safety, and general welfare of employees and patrons of
adult businesses and adult establishments, and to protect children from being
inadvertently exposed to adult material.
      2.   Conditions: In order to approve a conditional use permit for such
uses, the planning and zoning commission must determine that the following
conditions are met:
         a.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500') of a school, preschool, daycare facility, public park,
playground or other institution, either public or private, where children under
the age of eighteen (18) frequent or are taught, instructed or trained.
Distance shall be measured in a straight line from the property line of the
school or park to the property line of the proposed adult bookstore, adult
motion picture theater, or adult performance business; and
         b.   Such business shall not be located within five hundred feet
(500') of a church. Distance shall be measured as in subsection D2a of this
section; and
         c.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand feet
(1,000') of any other adult bookstore, adult motion picture theater or adult
performance business. Distance shall be measured as in subsection D2a of this
section; and
         d.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand feet
(1,000') of any store, bar, tavern or business that sells, vends, serves,
dispenses or distributes any alcoholic beverages, including, but not limited
to, beer, wine and liquor; and
         e.   Such business shall not be located on a lot or parcel that is
adjacent or contiguous to residential zones, even if separated by an alley.
This condition may be waived; provided, that sixty six and two-thirds percent
(662/3%) of the residentially zoned property owners and residents within five
hundred feet (500') of the proposed use sign a petition approving such a
business; and
         f.   Distance standards shall apply regardless of the political
jurisdiction in which schools, parks or churches, or other adult businesses,
are located; and
         g.   The sign package and exterior building design must be submitted
with the conditional use application for review by the planning and zoning
commission. Advertisements, displays or other promotional materials shall not
be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from the exterior of
the building; and
         h.   Lobby and entrance areas should be designed so as to minimize
obstruction of sidewalks during operating hours and shall be oriented and
consistent with other commercial activities in the area; and
         i.   All building openings, entries, windows and the like shall be
located, covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the
interior from any public or semipublic area; and
         j.   No loudspeakers or sound equipment shall be used for such
businesses that can be discerned by the public outside the building; and
         k.   The disposal of garbage and trash containing sexually explicit
materials must be disposed of in a manner that prevents minors from having
access to the material; and
         l.   The planning and zoning commission may impose such other
conditions and limitations as may be deemed necessary to carry out the purpose
of this subsection and to preserve and protect the general public health,
safety and welfare.
      3.   Applicability Of Standards: For purposes of this subsection, the
above conditions and standards shall be applicable in the following
circumstances:
         a.   The opening or commencement of any such business as a new
business.
         b.   The conversion of an existing business to any of the adult
businesses regulated herein.
         c.   The addition or expansion of any business to include any of the
adult businesses regulated herein.
         d.   The relocation of any such business.
      4.   School Defined: For purposes of this subsection, a "school" shall be
considered as an institution of learning for minors, whether public or private,
that offers instruction in those courses of study required by the state or that
is maintained pursuant to standards set by the state board of education. This
definition includes a kindergarten, elementary, junior high or senior high
school, or any special institution of learning under the jurisdiction of the
state department of education, but does not include a vocational or
professional institution or institution of higher education such as a community
or junior college, college or university.
      5.   Construction: These provisions shall not be construed as permitting
any use or act that is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law.
   E.   Lot Area Reduction In R2 MDR1 District (Combined Residential): Within
the R2 MDR1 district, the lot area for each dwelling unit contained in a
building or buildings on a "lot of record", as defined in section 11-1-3 of
this title, may be reduced to not less than two thousand (2,000) square feet if
authorized by a conditional use permit and the following conditions and
restrictions are met and complied with:
      1.   All other applicable zoning and use regulations have been met; and
      2.   The applicant must conclusively prove that the lot cannot feasibly
be developed without reduction in lot area; and
      3.   The improvements upon the lot would not be out of character with the
adjoining and surrounding improvements; and
      4.   Sufficient open space and amenities have been provided to create a
desirable living unit. (2003 Code § 11-06-06)
   F.   Exceptions To Parking Requirements: Parking space requirements for a
particular use as established by this title, may be reduced upon application
for conditional use approval in accordance with this title. Joint or mixed use
of off street parking facilities may be approved by a conditional use permit
submitted in accordance with this title. (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. 2012 Code)
   G.   Conversion Of Nonconforming Use: The conversion of a nonconforming use
to any use other than an allowed use is prohibited, except upon application and
issuance of a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of
section 11-6A-4 of this article; provided, however, that in addition to the
requirements of section 11-6A-4 of this article, such conditional use permit
will not be granted unless the planning and zoning commission makes all of the
following findings of fact: (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. Ord. 2085, 5-5-2009,
eff. 5-5-2009)
      1.   The proposed conversion is compatible with the comprehensive plan,
the purposes of this title and with surrounding land uses; and
      2.   Such proposed conversion will not place an undue burden on existing
transportation and service facilities in the vicinity of the application; and
      3.   Such proposed conversion will be in compliance with all requirements
and provisions of this code; and
      4.   The continuation of a nonconforming use without the benefit of such
conversion would likely result in a deterioration of the neighborhood. (2003
Code § 11-06-06)
   H.   Restoration Of Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming building or mobile
home destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the appraised value, where such destruction was not intentionally
caused by the owner or an agent of the owner of such property, may rebuild or
restore such building or mobile home to its former use. Such rebuilding or
restoration shall be substantially the same as the former building. (Ord. 2085,
5-5-2009, eff. 5-5-2009)
   I.   Expansion Of Conditional Uses And Legal Nonconforming Uses:
      1.   Findings Required: Expansions to conditional uses or legal
nonconforming uses that exceed twenty percent (20%) of the existing facility
(based on square footage or other dimensional measure) require conditional use
approval by the planning and zoning commission. Approval of such requests shall
be based upon the following findings:
         a.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not alter the zoning classification of the nonconforming use; and
         b.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
conforms to all existing requirements of this code; and
         c.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not place an undue burden on existing transportation and service
facilities in the vicinity; and
         d.   The proposed enlargement or expansion is not inimical to the best
interest of the surrounding neighborhood.
      2.   Illegal Expansion; Loss Of Status: Any illegal expansion of a
nonconforming use will result in the loss of the legal nonconforming use status
of that project.
   J.   General Height Exceptions: Conditional use approval from the planning
and zoning commission is required to exceed the height limits set forth in this
title. The planning and zoning commission's decision on height exceptions shall
be based upon the criteria set forth in section 11-6A-4M of this article.
   K.   Public Services; Height Exception: Public service poles, towers or
similar installations of a height of seventy feet (70') or greater must be
approved by conditional use permit. The planning and zoning commission must
make the findings required by section 11-6A-4M of this article and the
following additional findings. The pole or tower locations and heights:
      1.   Do not interfere with airport height restrictions; and
      2.   Minimize disturbance to views from established residential areas;
and
      3.   Minimize disturbance to or interference with view of city, state, or
federally registered historic structures; and
      4.   Do not obstruct clear vision triangles or otherwise threaten
motorist or pedestrian safety; and
      5.   Minimize conflict with existing uses; and
      6.   Are within route corridors already established for use by rail,
automobile traffic arterials or electrical transmission; and
      7.   Are within route corridors that provide for a satisfactory level of
energy efficient transmission of the product (electrical energy or other
signals); or
      8.   Are the best available alternative placements and heights, even
though they do not comply perfectly with all the above findings.
   L.   Professional, Administrative And Business Offices In M1 And M2
Districts: Professional, administrative and business offices are conditional
uses in the M1 and M2 districts and are subject to the following criteria as
well as those in section 11-6A-4M of this article:
      1.   Amenities (that may include, but are not limited to, visual
screening, orientation and placement of buildings, parking and access areas)
are provided for the future office to buffer the impact of any conflicting land
uses; and
      2.   The lot or parcel occupied by such offices abuts a public right of
way that separates such lot or parcel from residential or office zones or uses;
or
      3.   Where the use of the subject property for such offices will not
encroach upon or conflict with existing industrial development or that which
may be reasonably expected to develop.
   M.   Composting Facility: Any composting facility shall submit a site and
operational plan with their application for a conditional use permit. That plan
shall demonstrate compliance with the following requirements:
      1.   Composting piles or windrows shall be constructed that are no larger
than can be managed in a nuisance free manner by the proposed equipment and
composting technology;
      2.   Additional area shall be provided at no less than fifteen percent
(15%) of size of the active composting pile or windrow area for staging, curing
and storage;
      3.   A minimum fifty foot (50') setback shall be maintained from the
property boundary or public right of way to any active processing area of the
facility, including any area used for storage, active composting and curing;
      4.   A minimum two hundred foot (200') buffer zone between the active
composting pile or windrow and any existing adjacent residentially zoned or
occupied property shall be maintained;
      5.   Compliance with all applicable state or federal laws, regulations or
standards pertaining to water quality, air quality and solid waste management
shall be required;
      6.   No composting facility shall be allowed in a floodplain;
      7.   Surface slope of one to five percent (5%) grade shall be required
for any composting facility;
      8.   Adequate fencing, barriers or screening shall be required for all
composting facilities;

on duty and during limited operating hours;
      10.   Adequate space shall be provided between the piles or windrows to
allow access to vehicles, including firefighting equipment;
      11.   Noncompostable residues shall be disposed or processed at a
permitted solid waste disposal facility in accordance with local, state and
federal laws, regulations and standards;
      12.   All organic materials received at the composting facility shall be
removed from any containers unless the containers are of a biodegradable type
in which case the container shall be opened before composting;
      13.   A permanent sign must be posted and maintained at the composting
facility showing the nature of the project, facility name, address and
telephone number of operator, operating hours, materials that may be received
by the facility, and the phrase, "No Dumping Of Garbage, Trash Or Rubbish
Allowed". (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. Ord. 2265, 3-4-2025)

11-5-3-1: LOCATION IN MOBILE HOME PARK REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to maintain a mobile home or travel trailer for
residential purposes outside a mobile home park or in a mobile home subdivision
(R2T) previously titled R2-T or MDR2 zone. Such prohibition shall apply
regardless of whether the parking site shall be on private or public premises,
streets, alleys or highways. Mobile homes used for residential quarters for
watchmen or caretakers and located on the premises of an industrial
establishment in any industrial zone may be permitted by a conditional use
permit. (2003 Code § 11-05-04)
11-6A-6: OTHER CONDITIONAL USE APPROVALS:
There are certain conditional uses that require consideration of additional
approval criteria unique to the specific application. In reviewing such
applications, the Planning and Zoning Commission must consider the standards of
approval set forth for each conditional use described below in addition to the
general criteria and findings set forth for conditional use permits in
subsection 11-6A-4M of this article. An application and fee are required for
each request in accordance with sections 11-3-2 and 11-3-3 of this title. (Ord.
2164, 12-5-2017)
   A.   Agriculture: The tilling of soil, aquaculture, raising crops,

   8.   General Childcare Requirements:
      a.   Provide a minimum on site outdoor play area of one hundred (100)
square feet per child. This area requirement may be waived or modified if
appropriate open space with connecting public sidewalks or paths are located
near the facility and that open space can be used by the children as a play
area; or the program of the facility is such that the size of a group of
children using the play area at any one time conforms to the one hundred (100)
square feet per child criteria. This criteria may also be met by safely
transporting students to an approved outdoor play area.
      b.   Provide a minimum of thirty five (35) square feet of indoor gross
play area per child.
      c.   Secure and maintain a childcare license from the State (for

      d.   Comply with the regulations where applicable by law or jurisdiction
of the City Building and Fire Department, and the County health inspector.
      e.   Provide as a minimum, one off street parking space per employee.
      f.   Provide for an on-site child pick up area if located on a collector

area, screening and setbacks.
      h.   An application fee set by the City Council and amended from time to
time by resolution, shall be paid with the submittal of an application.
   9.   Standards: The Zoning Administrator/building official may also require
the following standards to protect adjacent properties from adverse impacts or
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children:
      a.   Fencing or landscape screening of the facility to protect adjacent
properties from activities of the facility, or to protect the children from
adverse activities such as traffic on arterial or collector streets, at
intersections or to screen adjacent properties; or
      b.   Additional setbacks to play areas from property line to protect
adjacent properties or to protect children from busy streets, irrigation
ditches, animal pastures and other similar conflicts; or
      c.   Any other conditions deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator/
building official to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children, or
to protect adjacent property owners from adverse impacts. (Ord. 2164, 12-5-
2017)
   10.   Adult Daycare Standards: Adult daycare has different use
characteristics from other allowed uses and therefor requires additional
standards to be determined by the Zoning Administrator/building official:
         a.   There shall be adequate access for physically handicapped patrons
of the facility.
         b.   If located on an arterial or collector street, provide for an on
site patron pick up area designed to prevent vehicles from backing onto street
(backing into alley is permissible).
         c.   The use shall meet the occupancy requirements of the city
building and fire departments.
         d.   All applicable licenses must be obtained from the city or the
state.
         e.   An application fee set by the city council and amended from time
to time by resolution, shall be paid with the submittal of an application.
   C.   Drive-Up Windows: No drive-up window establishment shall be permitted
unless the planning and zoning commission finds that the design and operation
of the establishment is substantially in compliance with the following
requirements and conditions that shall be in addition to those required in
section 11-6A-4 of this article:
      1.   The location of the establishment shall not cause an increase of
commercial traffic in nearby residential neighborhoods, increase general
traffic congestion where serious congestion problems already exist, or cause
other significant adverse impacts on public or private property in the vicinity
of the site. The advice of the appropriate transportation authority shall be
solicited for the purpose of evaluating existing and projected levels of
service and the effects of projected turning movements on highway safety; and
      2.   The internal circulation on the site provides for pedestrians to
walk from parking lots to the lobby entrances without traversing the waiting
lanes for the drive-up window; and
      3.   The waiting lanes be of sufficient length to provide for anticipated
average monthly peak volumes; and
      4.   The design, signage or operational characteristics of the
establishment prevent or discourage vehicles from waiting for service on public
sidewalks or streets; and
      5.   Drive-in waiting lanes be designed so that curbs, gates or other
devices do not prevent a vehicle from leaving a waiting lane; and
      6.   All lights and other illuminated materials shall be designed,
positioned, shielded, directed and located to prevent glare from falling on
adjoining properties. Screening of lights may be required as a secondary
measure of mitigation. Illumination levels shall not exceed two (2) foot-
candles as measured one foot (1') above the ground at property lines shared
with residentially zoned or used parcels; and
      7.   The drive-up window service does not constitute the entire
establishment. This finding may be waived upon showing that the public interest
would be better served if the drive-up window service does constitute the
entire establishment; and
      8.   The design, operation and sign characteristics of the project will
attempt to minimize air pollution and wasteful consumption of fuel. Required
mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Prohibiting all parking spaces that are in addition to the
minimum number of parking spaces required by this title; and
         b.   Retention of existing desirable trees for reasons of species,
location, health, age or other reason as determined and recommended by the city
engineer; and
         c.   Maximum placement of landscaped areas and trees; and
      9.   Landscaping shall screen drive-up aisles from the public right of
way and shall be used to minimize the visual impact of vehicular lights, reader
board signs and directional signs; and
      10.   Drive-through lanes shall be set back at least ten feet (10') from
adjacent residentially zoned or used property. This buffer shall include both
coniferous trees and sound abatement walls; and
      11.   Any drive-up window establishment that is within three hundred feet
(300') of a residential use or zone, as measured along the shortest distance
between the nearest residential property line and any part of the drive-up
portion of the land use, shall not be permitted to utilize outdoor order
speakers; use of a handheld phone or an order window shall be required; and
      12.   In accordance with section 11-6A-4 of this article, the planning
and zoning commission has the authority to limit the hours of operation, and
may impose such restrictions on drive-up window establishments.
   D.   Adult Bookstore, Adult Motion Picture Theater, Adult Performance
Business Or Adult Entertainment Establishment:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of these regulations is to protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city, to
protect the health, safety, and general welfare of employees and patrons of
adult businesses and adult establishments, and to protect children from being
inadvertently exposed to adult material.
      2.   Conditions: In order to approve a conditional use permit for such
uses, the planning and zoning commission must determine that the following
conditions are met:
         a.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500') of a school, preschool, daycare facility, public park,
playground or other institution, either public or private, where children under
the age of eighteen (18) frequent or are taught, instructed or trained.
Distance shall be measured in a straight line from the property line of the
school or park to the property line of the proposed adult bookstore, adult
motion picture theater, or adult performance business; and
         b.   Such business shall not be located within five hundred feet
(500') of a church. Distance shall be measured as in subsection D2a of this
section; and
         c.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand feet
(1,000') of any other adult bookstore, adult motion picture theater or adult
performance business. Distance shall be measured as in subsection D2a of this
section; and
         d.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand feet
(1,000') of any store, bar, tavern or business that sells, vends, serves,
dispenses or distributes any alcoholic beverages, including, but not limited
to, beer, wine and liquor; and
         e.   Such business shall not be located on a lot or parcel that is
adjacent or contiguous to residential zones, even if separated by an alley.
This condition may be waived; provided, that sixty six and two-thirds percent
(662/3%) of the residentially zoned property owners and residents within five
hundred feet (500') of the proposed use sign a petition approving such a
business; and
         f.   Distance standards shall apply regardless of the political
jurisdiction in which schools, parks or churches, or other adult businesses,
are located; and
         g.   The sign package and exterior building design must be submitted
with the conditional use application for review by the planning and zoning
commission. Advertisements, displays or other promotional materials shall not
be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from the exterior of
the building; and
         h.   Lobby and entrance areas should be designed so as to minimize
obstruction of sidewalks during operating hours and shall be oriented and
consistent with other commercial activities in the area; and
         i.   All building openings, entries, windows and the like shall be
located, covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the
interior from any public or semipublic area; and
         j.   No loudspeakers or sound equipment shall be used for such
businesses that can be discerned by the public outside the building; and
         k.   The disposal of garbage and trash containing sexually explicit
materials must be disposed of in a manner that prevents minors from having
access to the material; and
         l.   The planning and zoning commission may impose such other
conditions and limitations as may be deemed necessary to carry out the purpose
of this subsection and to preserve and protect the general public health,
safety and welfare.
      3.   Applicability Of Standards: For purposes of this subsection, the
above conditions and standards shall be applicable in the following
circumstances:
         a.   The opening or commencement of any such business as a new
business.
         b.   The conversion of an existing business to any of the adult
businesses regulated herein.
         c.   The addition or expansion of any business to include any of the
adult businesses regulated herein.
         d.   The relocation of any such business.
      4.   School Defined: For purposes of this subsection, a "school" shall be
considered as an institution of learning for minors, whether public or private,
that offers instruction in those courses of study required by the state or that
is maintained pursuant to standards set by the state board of education. This
definition includes a kindergarten, elementary, junior high or senior high
school, or any special institution of learning under the jurisdiction of the
state department of education, but does not include a vocational or
professional institution or institution of higher education such as a community
or junior college, college or university.
      5.   Construction: These provisions shall not be construed as permitting
any use or act that is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law.
   E.   Lot Area Reduction In R2 MDR1 District (Combined Residential): Within
the R2 MDR1 district, the lot area for each dwelling unit contained in a
building or buildings on a "lot of record", as defined in section 11-1-3 of
this title, may be reduced to not less than two thousand (2,000) square feet if
authorized by a conditional use permit and the following conditions and
restrictions are met and complied with:
      1.   All other applicable zoning and use regulations have been met; and
      2.   The applicant must conclusively prove that the lot cannot feasibly
be developed without reduction in lot area; and
      3.   The improvements upon the lot would not be out of character with the
adjoining and surrounding improvements; and
      4.   Sufficient open space and amenities have been provided to create a
desirable living unit. (2003 Code § 11-06-06)
   F.   Exceptions To Parking Requirements: Parking space requirements for a
particular use as established by this title, may be reduced upon application
for conditional use approval in accordance with this title. Joint or mixed use

submitted in accordance with this title. (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. 2012 Code)

to any use other than an allowed use is prohibited, except upon application and
issuance of a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of
section 11-6A-4 of this article; provided, however, that in addition to the
requirements of section 11-6A-4 of this article, such conditional use permit
will not be granted unless the planning and zoning commission makes all of the
following findings of fact: (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. Ord. 2085, 5-5-2009,
eff. 5-5-2009)
      1.   The proposed conversion is compatible with the comprehensive plan,

   H.   Restoration Of Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming building or mobile
home destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or

restore such building or mobile home to its former use. Such rebuilding or
restoration shall be substantially the same as the former building. (Ord. 2085,
5-5-2009, eff. 5-5-2009)

      1.   Findings Required: Expansions to conditional uses or legal
nonconforming uses that exceed twenty percent (20%) of the existing facility
(based on square footage or other dimensional measure) require conditional use
approval by the planning and zoning commission. Approval of such requests shall
be based upon the following findings:
         a.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not alter the zoning classification of the nonconforming use; and
         b.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
conforms to all existing requirements of this code; and
         c.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not place an undue burden on existing transportation and service
facilities in the vicinity; and
         d.   The proposed enlargement or expansion is not inimical to the best
interest of the surrounding neighborhood.
      2.   Illegal Expansion; Loss Of Status: Any illegal expansion of a
nonconforming use will result in the loss of the legal nonconforming use status
of that project.
   J.   General Height Exceptions: Conditional use approval from the planning
and zoning commission is required to exceed the height limits set forth in this
title. The planning and zoning commission's decision on height exceptions shall
be based upon the criteria set forth in section 11-6A-4M of this article.
   K.   Public Services; Height Exception: Public service poles, towers or
similar installations of a height of seventy feet (70') or greater must be
approved by conditional use permit. The planning and zoning commission must
make the findings required by section 11-6A-4M of this article and the
following additional findings. The pole or tower locations and heights:
      1.   Do not interfere with airport height restrictions; and
      2.   Minimize disturbance to views from established residential areas;
and
      3.   Minimize disturbance to or interference with view of city, state, or
federally registered historic structures; and
      4.   Do not obstruct clear vision triangles or otherwise threaten

energy efficient transmission of the product (electrical energy or other

      8.   Are the best available alternative placements and heights, even
though they do not comply perfectly with all the above findings.
   L.   Professional, Administrative And Business Offices In M1 And M2

screening, orientation and placement of buildings, parking and access areas)
are provided for the future office to buffer the impact of any conflicting land
uses; and
      2.   The lot or parcel occupied by such offices abuts a public right of
way that separates such lot or parcel from residential or office zones or uses;
or
      3.   Where the use of the subject property for such offices will not
encroach upon or conflict with existing industrial development or that which
may be reasonably expected to develop.
   M.   Composting Facility: Any composting facility shall submit a site and
operational plan with their application for a conditional use permit. That plan
shall demonstrate compliance with the following requirements:
      1.   Composting piles or windrows shall be constructed that are no larger
than can be managed in a nuisance free manner by the proposed equipment and

      2.   Additional area shall be provided at no less than fifteen percent
(15%) of size of the active composting pile or windrow area for staging, curing

parties, including allocating all or some of such costs jointly and severally
against more than one responsible party regardless of whether a responsible
party has any other legal liability. If the fire chief determines not to assess
all or a portion of mitigation costs against a responsible party, such
determination shall not in any way limit, reduce, or extinguish the liability
of the responsible party to any other parties.
      5.   After determining to assess mitigation costs against a responsible
party, the fire chief or his or her designee shall mail an itemized invoice to
the responsible party at its last known address. Such invoice shall be due and

such costs, if upheld, shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the date
of determination of the appeal.

shall have an opportunity to meet with the fire chief or his or her designee to
request a modification of mitigation costs. The responsible party shall request
in writing within ten (10) days from the date of the invoice assessing the
mitigation costs. If after meeting with the fire chief or his or her designee
the responsible party is still not satisfied, he or she may request an appeal
to city council as set forth herein.

responsible party and/or the assessment of mitigation costs who desires an

rightful owners of such property has become a serious problem within the City.
The City also finds that recovery of the lost or stolen property becomes more
difficult the longer the property is missing and that local pawnbrokers and
secondhand precious metal dealers currently do not have any way to know whether
property that is sold to them is the substance of a theft.
Therefore, the City hereby finds that the use of the electronic database of
lost and stolen property known as "LeadsOnline" will provide assistance to both
the person who has been the victim of a theft and the pawnbroker/secondhand
dealer who has been the victim of paying money for stolen property by providing
a place for the reporting of lost and stolen property. (Ord. 2115, 4-2-2013)
   B.   Records To Be Kept And Filed: All pawnbrokers and secondhand precious

digital records shall be filed within seventy two (72) hours after the time and
date of the transaction. The digital records required for filing shall consist
of the following:
      1.   An accurate description of all precious metals and personal property
purchased, acquired or received.
      2.   The name, residence, driver's license number or social security
number of the person from whom any precious metals or personal property is

operation of any taxicab operated by such licensed operation to any property or
to any person or persons other than the taxicab owner or its chauffeur
operator. Also, it is further expressly required that if the amount of said
cash or cash value of said bonds, as so deposited, has been reduced at any time
by payments therefrom for damages to property or persons, then in that event
the taxicab owner and licensed operator hereunder shall replenish the said

specifications:
   A.   A taximeter is a mechanical instrument or device by which the charge
for hire of a taxicab is mechanically calculated, whether for distance traveled
or for waiting time, or both, and upon which such charge shall be indicated by
means of legible figures, which are electrically lighted each time the
taximeter flag is thrown from nonearning to earning position. There shall also
be a similar indicating mechanism to show charges for extra passengers.
   B.   Such meters must register upon visual counters the following items:
      1.   Total miles.
      2.   Paid miles.
      3.   Number of trips.
      4.   Number of extras.
   C.   Each taximeter must be furnished with a tamperproof switch and system
of electrical distribution so that when the taximeter flag is in the vacant or
nonearning position, the vacant sign on the top of the taxicab will be lighted,
and when the meter flag is thrown to an earning position, the fare indicator on
the taximeter will be lighted.
   D.   Each taximeter must be driven direct from the taxicab transmission, or
connected with speedometer driving shaft to the taximeter head itself.
   E.   No person shall use or permit to be used upon any taxicab a taximeter
which does not conform to these allowable tolerances.

shall have been inspected and found to be accurate.
   G.   No driver of a taxicab equipped with a taximeter while carrying
passengers, or under employment, shall display the taximeter flag affixed to
such taximeter in such position as to denote that such vehicle is not employed,

"vacant" position until after the fare is paid. (2003 Code § 5-09-20)
4-11-21: COMPUTATION OF CHARGES:
It shall be unlawful for any person owning, operating or driving a taxicab with
taximeter installed to operate or drive such taxicab unless such taximeter is
used in determining the fare to be charged and no other or different fare shall
be charged to a passenger than is recorded on the reading face of said
taximeter for a trip, except that the hourly rate may be used on mutual
agreement of passenger and owner of the taxicab. (2003 Code § 5-09-21)
4-11-22: FARE RATES:
The rates and charges for transporting persons for hire by the operator
licensed under this chapter and title shall be fair and reasonable. The
operator shall file a schedule of its rates and charges with the city clerk
with its application and shall make no adjustments or changes in rates or
charges until sixty (60) days after the filing of a new rates and charges
schedule with the city clerk, at which time such rates and charges shall become
effective, unless disapproved by the city council. A schedule of the authorized
rates and charges shall be legibly printed on a card not less than four inches
by six inches (4" x 6") and conspicuously displayed in each taxicab. (2003 Code

fare in advance and may refuse employment unless it be prepaid, but no driver
of a taxicab shall otherwise refuse or neglect to convey any orderly persons
upon request anywhere in the city unless previously engaged or unable to do so.
No driver of a taxicab shall carry any other person than the passenger first
employing the taxicab without the consent of the passenger. In such event, if a
taximeter be used, the first departing passenger shall pay the face amount as
shown on meter. The meter shall then be cleared and the remaining passenger
shall pay for distance thereafter carried. If the taxi be unmetered, the fare
to be charged shall be as follows: The first departing passenger shall pay the
regular fare to his place of departure, and the remaining passenger shall then
pay the regular fare from his point of pick up to point of delivery. (2003 Code
§ 5-09-23)

requesting the hearing shall be retained as the fee for claiming the animal.

shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      2.   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only

of traffic is facing the signal and, if two (2) or more lanes of traffic are
facing the signal in the same direction, vehicular traffic in the right lane
only, may, after stopping, cautiously proceed to make a right turn, with proper
care to avoid accident, but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians
lawfully within a crosswalk, and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.

   A.   Declaration Of Necessity And Purpose: The city council finds and
declares that within certain residential areas of the city there exists a heavy
concentration of vehicles which remain parked throughout the day and that a
substantial portion of these vehicles are not owned or operated by residents of
these areas; that the presence of these vehicles causes vehicular congestion on
residential streets, impedes the movement of traffic, and unduly restricts the
entry of residents to their homes; that such vehicular congestion creates
excessive disturbance, trash and refuse and causes the deterioration of
residential area. The city council, therefore, declares the necessity and
public policy of protecting the availability of parking for residents, of
alleviating congestion of vehicles that are parked on the sides of the streets
in and around the neighborhoods surrounding the public schools located in the
city, and of reducing the excessive disturbance, trash, and refuse in the
residential areas surrounding the public schools, by providing designated
parking areas for public school students during school hours. The purpose of
this chapter is to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhoods surrounding the public schools.
   B.   Student Parking Restricted To Certain Areas: During the hours of seven
thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to four o'clock (4:00) P.M., Monday through Friday,
when school is in session, all students of any public school located in the
city shall park their vehicles only in areas or parking lots designated by the
school and/or the police chief, for student parking. Notice of such designation
shall be given by each respective school or the police department to the
students in a manner that provides reasonable notice to the students of the
areas or parking lots wherein they may park their vehicles. (2003 Code § 10-11-
09)

within the immediate vicinity of such parked vehicle; or
   C.   For any purpose incident to a lawful commercial operation located in
any residential or commercial district within the immediate vicinity of such

than eight (8) hours. (2003 Code § 10-11-11)
7-4-13: PARKING TICKETS AND PROCEDURES:
Any owner or operator of a motor vehicle who violates this chapter shall be
guilty of a parking violation and shall be required to pay a penalty as
described below. The administrative procedure for payment of parking tickets
for violations is set forth below.
   A.   Tickets: It shall be the duty of the police department, or other
designee of the chief of police, upon observing a vehicle parked or stopped in
violation of the provisions of this chapter, to leave upon such vehicle a
separate notice or ticket for each violation, or as frequently as every two (2)
hours, that such vehicle has been parked or stopped in violation of provisions
of this chapter. Among other things, each notice shall bear the date and hour
of leaving the same at or upon the vehicle, make of the vehicle, and its
license number, the specific code section violated and the amount of the fine,
instructing the owner or operator of such vehicle to report to the police
department. One copy or an automated record of each notice mentioned herein
shall be filed with the police department.
   B.   Owner Or Operator Liable: If any vehicle is found stopped, standing or
parked in any manner in violation of any provision of this chapter and the
identity of the operator cannot be determined, the owner or person or
corporation in whose name said vehicle is registered or the named lessee in a
rental or lease agreement of said vehicle shall be held prima facie responsible
for said violation.
   C.   Time Of Payment: In order to eliminate burdening courts with violations
of ordinances and to eliminate insofar as possible public inconvenience, each
person receiving a parking ticket under this chapter left upon his or her
vehicle shall, within seventy two (72) hours of the time of such notice, pay to
the police department in full satisfaction of such violation, the fee indicated
on the ticket left upon his or her vehicle. If the ticket has not been paid
within the seventy two (72) hours above prescribed, an additional fee in such
amount as established by resolution of the city council for each such violation
shall be assessed and fined against such person, such fee deemed necessary to
defray administrative and clerical expense.
   D.   Contesting Citation: In the event that the ticket is contested, the
person shall appear at the police department within a seven (7) day period and
sign a document contesting the violation charged. In the event that a contest
is made, the city attorney may amend the citation by filing an infraction
citation or complaint for parking violation or failure to pay a parking penalty
with the magistrate division of the district court. At the time of contesting
such violation, the police officer may assign a time and date to appear at an
arraignment in the magistrate division of the county district court. In
addition to the fines set forth above, court costs may be imposed by the
magistrate court in accordance with Idaho court rules.
   E.   Failure To Contest And Pay: Failure to timely contest the citation as
set forth above shall be deemed an admission to the violation and the police
department shall enter a default. Subsequent failure to pay the applicable
penalty within fourteen (14) days after the contest period has run as set forth
in subsection D of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and, in addition
to the penalty for the parking violation, subject the violator to penalty as
provided in title 1, chapter 4 of this code. Upon entering the default, the
police department shall notify the violator that the penalty must be paid
within fourteen (14) days or a misdemeanor citation for failure to pay penalty
will be filed in district court, subjecting the violator to possible penalties
as provided in title 1, chapter 4 of this code.
   F.   Immobilization And Towing: In addition to any other penalties that may
apply, vehicles parked in violation of this chapter may be towed and impounded
or booted at the owner's expense. Any vehicle that has one or more delinquent
unpaid tickets, after having an opportunity to contest and/or pay the ticket
pursuant to this section, and who either has been adjudged guilty of the
violation by a competent court and subsequently has failed to pay such ticket,
or who simply failed to pay or contest the ticket, may be immobilized by a tire
boot and towed until such time that the owner of the vehicle pays such
delinquent tickets.
   G.   Fee Schedule: Within seventy two (72) hours of the time of such notice,
the violator shall pay to the police department in full satisfaction of such
violation, the fee indicated in the following fee schedule for each notice left
upon his or her vehicle:

five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of restoration conditioned upon the
faithful performance of the applicant and permittee that it will fix and
replace the restoration work with respect to such streets, alleys, fixtures or
other property located in, under or over such streets or alleys, and so
affected by such work, to the satisfaction of the city; and such bond shall be
further conditioned that in the event of the failure of applicant and permittee
to do such restoration work, the city may recover from said cash so deposited,
or from the surety of such bond so posted, all costs and expenses to be
incurred by the city to see that the street or alley, and other fixtures or
property, is restored to a satisfactory condition, the penalty of such bond to
cover any legal expenses and court costs which may be incurred by the city for
the purpose of securing faithful compliance with the application and permit;
and conditioned further that said bond shall be deemed to continue in full
force and effect until the public works director shall have issued a completion
certificate.
   B.   Provided, however, that in lieu of the foregoing bond, any person,
firm, or corporation may provide a continuous surety performance bond in a
reasonable amount issued by a company licensed to do business in the state, and
in a form to be approved by the city, conditioned upon the faithful performance
of such person, firm or corporation to the following effect: that if such
person, firm or corporation secures a permit under this chapter, that permittee
shall comply with all the rules, regulations, orders, requirements and
obligations as required to be complied with by a person, firm or corporation
furnishing a bond as required above; provided, further, that if the aggregate
of the estimated cost of restoration work of all projects of an applicant or
permittee in progress at any one time exceeds the amount of such continuous
surety performance bond, then the amount of such bond must be increased to
cover the aggregate of the estimated costs of all restoration projects with
which applicant permittee is connected and for which a completion certificate
has not been issued. Such blanket performance bond may be adjusted, from time
to time, to coincide with the requirement of the amount of such bond must equal
the aggregate estimated cost of all restoration work not then completed.
   C.   No permit hereunder will be issued to an applicant who is delinquent
for thirty (30) days or more with respect to restoration costs for which
applicant has been previously billed.
   D.   The city may proceed against and collect from the bond or bonding

when construction, repair or excavation shall again commence. (2003 Code § 8-
06-06)
8-3-9: COMPLETION OF WORK AND BACKFILLING:
All work shall be expeditiously performed and completed as soon as reasonably
possible. Upon completion of construction or repair, the permittee shall
promptly backfill any street, alley, easement or other public right of way in
which permittee has made any excavation. All work and backfilling shall be done
in accordance with the city standard drawings and engineering specifications
adopted by the city. (2003 Code § 8-06-07)
   A.   This subsection covers the work of installing nonshrink backfill
materials in certain trench cuts located within the city of Blackfoot rights of
way. The city of Blackfoot maintains an IWORQ's pavement management system that
grades all rights of way on a scale of 1 to 10, with a 10 being a right of way
in excellent condition. This subsection shall apply to all trench cuts within
rights of way that are designated as a 4 or higher. The designation is
available from the city of Blackfoot at the time of obtaining a permit for the
trench cut.
All requirements for excavation shall meet with the city of Blackfoot
specifications when working within the city's rights of way.
After the permittee has excavated and disposed of all material from the trench
area and upon completion of the installation and testing of the installed line,
the permittee shall wrap all mechanical fittings with plastic sheeting (minimum
4 mil) in a manner which will prevent bonding of the nonshrink material to the
fitting. The permittee shall then place compact gravel to a level of one foot
(1') above the installed line. The permittee shall then place nonshrink
backfill material in the trench using a method that fills all voids to the top
of the existing subgrade elevation. After sufficient time for the nonshrink
backfill material to cure in order to carry the traffic loads, the permittee
shall then replace the asphalt plant mix surfacing and aggregate base in
accordance with specifications of the city of Blackfoot.
The nonshrink backfill material shall be encasement concrete with a minimum
cement content of fifty (50) pounds to the cubic yard, maximum water to cement
ratio of 0.80, a maximum slump of ten (10), and a zero to ten percent (10%) air
content.
All backfilling made pursuant to this subsection shall be supervised at the
time of backfilling and approved by a representative of the street department
of the city of Blackfoot. The permittee must schedule in advance with the
street department for a representative to be present at the time of the
backfill. (Ord. 2128, 1-6-2015, eff. 1-6-2015)
8-3-10: TIME TO COMPLETE REPAIRS:
Permanent asphalt repairs shall be completed by the permittee not later than
three (3) days after the excavation has been backfilled, unless otherwise
authorized by the public works director or his designated representative. If
weather conditions prohibit permanent repairs, the public works director, or
his designated representative, may authorize the use and installation of
temporary cold patches. Such temporary cold patches shall be replaced by the
permittee as soon as weather permits. (2003 Code § 8-06-08)
8-3-11: MAINTENANCE AND SAFEGUARDS:
The permittee shall continuously maintain the construction, repair or
excavation site in a safe condition and keep the site free from any condition
that may cause risk of harm to any person or property at all times after the
work has commenced and until all work, including permanent patching, has been
completed and accepted by the city. During such time, the permittee also shall
provide, install and continuously maintain proper safeguards, signs and
barricades at the construction, repair or excavation site. Such signs and
barricades shall conform to the requirements and standards set forth in the
most recent edition of the "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices"
published by the U.S. department of transportation, federal highway
administration, or any other manual adopted by the state department of
transportation, pursuant to the provisions of Idaho Code section 49-201. (2003
Code § 8-06-09)
8-3-12: WARRANTY OF REPAIRS:
The permittee shall warrant to the city the adequacy and continued satisfactory
condition and function of all backfill and permanent patches installed by
permittee or by any agent or employee of permittee for a period of one year
after the permanent patch has been accepted by the public works director. Such
warranty shall extend only to any unsatisfactory condition or function caused
by inferior design, workmanship and materials furnished by permittee or by any
agent or employee of permittee. (2003 Code § 8-06-10)
8-3-13: REPAIRS BY CITY:
If the permittee fails to install permanent patching within three (3) days
after completion of backfill, or if the permittee fails to honor the warranty
set forth in section
8-3-12 of this chapter after demand by the city, the city may complete the work
and make such repairs. If such repairs are completed by the city, the city may
charge the cost of the repairs to the permittee. The cost of repairs shall be
based upon the actual charges and cost to the city of repairs at the time the
repair was completed. If the permittee is charged with the city's costs of
repairs, the permittee shall pay such cost within five (5) days after the city
has given written notice to permittee of the cost. (2003 Code § 8-06-11)
8-3-14: REMEDY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE:
If any permittee fails to perform any duty imposed by this chapter, or if any
permittee fails to pay the costs assessed pursuant to section
8-3-13 of this chapter within the time provided therein, the city, at its
option and upon prior written notice to permittee, may suspend or revoke any
contractor's license issued by the city to the permittee, cancel or revoke all
permits held by the permittee and refuse to issue to the permittee further
permits for construction, repair or excavation in public rights of way or
easements of the city. In addition to the foregoing remedies, a misdemeanor
criminal action may be filed against the permittee for violating this chapter.
(2003 Code § 8-06-12)
8-3-15: NO DUTY UPON CITY:
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to impose any private duty
or obligation upon the city to properly or accurately locate any utility line
or facility or to ensure that a permittee fully complies with the provisions
hereof. (2003 Code § 8-06-13)
8-3-16: PENALTY:
Unless otherwise stated herein, a violation of any provision in this chapter
shall constitute a misdemeanor, subject to penalty as provided in title 1,

This chapter is adopted with the intent to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of all residents within the city, especially in the context of
efficient emergency dispatch considerations. To achieve this purpose, the city
shall coordinate closely, through the planning and zoning administrator, with
representatives of the addressing committee and the planning and zoning
committee. This collaboration will ensure the implementation and maintenance of
a fair and uniform street naming and address numbering grid system.
Furthermore, the city shall establish procedures for making necessary

set forth and made a part of the official street name list.
   A.   Standards: The following standards shall be used in determining or
approving street names:
      1.   Duplication Of Names Prohibited: There shall be no duplication of
street names by sound or spelling within any address numbering grid system
area. Differentiation shall not be by the addition of suffixes such as "road",
"street", "lane", etc. Street and road name duplications may be permitted only
where the streets involved are situated within two (2) or more separate
addressing grid system areas, when it can be determined that such duplication
will not cause confusion or jeopardize the public safety.
      2.   Future Street Dedications: Names for future street dedications shall
be suggested by the person or agency proposing the street dedication, subject
to all provisions of this chapter. The planning and zoning commission shall
determine what constitutes a separate street.
      3.   Prefixes: Directional prefixes will only be used in conjunction with
grid streets (i.e., East Bridge).
      4.   Suffixes: Each approved street name shall require a street suffix.
Only one (1) street suffix will be allowed per street name. Directional
suffixes may only be allowed in conjunction with grid streets. All street
suffixes will be abbreviated in compliance with the United States Postal
Addressing Standards. The following suffixes shall be used in designating
street names:
         a.   Street: An east-west right of way generally running in a straight
line that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties, the
dedication of which has been legally accepted, except streets in existence at
this date.
         b.   Avenue: A north-south right of way generally running in a
straight line that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent
properties, the dedication of which has been legally accepted, except avenues
in existence at this date.
         c.   Drive: A right of way generally meandering in an east-west
direction that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties,
the dedication of which has been legally accepted.
         d.   Way: A right of way generally meandering in a north-south
direction that provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties,
the dedication of which has been legally accepted.
         e.   Court: An east-west dead end street connecting to a drive or
street at one end only and at the other end providing a cul-de-sac with a
radius of forty five feet (45') at the face of curb to the center of the
circle.
         f.   Place: A north-south dead end street connecting to a drive or
street at one end only and at the other end providing a cul-de-sac with a
radius of forty five feet (45') at the face of curb to the center of the
circle.
         g.   Lane: A private street, officially accepted as such, but not
maintained by the city or the county. Its acceptance is based upon an
application request and approval. Any private lane that has two (2) or more
addresses must be officially named.
         h.   Boulevard: Normally eighty foot (80') or greater right of way
which provides vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent properties, the
dedication of which has been officially accepted by the city or county and
which is separated by a median strip, usually landscaped.

rural areas, dedicated and maintained by the city or county.
         j.   Loop: A secondary thoroughfare that returns to the same
originating road.

the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), street name,
directional suffix (if any), and street type, designation of apartment or
suite, and apartment/suite number.
      6.   Circle Or Dead End Streets: Five (5) platted lots or less coming
immediately off of any right of way shall carry the suffix "circle" after the
name of the street from which it emerges and shall be numbered according to the
grid of such street. Short dead end streets with five (5) or less addresses,
coming immediately off of a road of arterial or collector status, may also be
designated as "circles" and carry the name of the streets from which they
emerge, if such dead end streets will not or cannot be extended and provided
with their own names in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      7.   Existing Names; Preference: Where the proposed street is on the same
alignment, and is a continuation of an existing street, the name of the
existing street shall be applied. Where a street is on the same alignment but
is not linked to an existing street, the planning and zoning commission shall
designate a name, giving preference to existing names.
      8.   One Designation: Where a proposed street dedication unites two (2)
differently named streets located on the same alignment, the planning and
zoning commission shall designate one of the existing names.
      9. Prefixes: Streets may be given the prefix "north", "south", "east" or
"west" if they cross address numbering grid system baselines.
      10.   Change In Direction: If a street makes a very obvious change in
direction, a new street name shall be assigned. Whenever this situation occurs,
the change of street name should occur at an intersection rather than the point
where the direction changes.

have signs indicating its name and status as "private".
   C.   Subdivisions:
      1.   Shown On Plats: Proposed subdivision street names shall be shown on
preliminary and final subdivision plats when submitted to the planning and
zoning commission. The commission shall not approve such plats until the street
names have been checked against the official street name map and list.

be named in accordance with the definitions here noted.
      3.   Overall Theme: Subdividers shall be encouraged to use an overall
theme when naming their streets.

to determine what name is to be used when two (2) or more streets are in
alignment.
      5.   Plat Approval: No plat shall be approved by the city council for
filing until all provisions of this chapter have been complied with. Approval
of a final plat for filing in the county recorder's office shall constitute
acceptance of all street names shown thereon.
      6.   Street Signs: It shall be the responsibility of any subdivider
dedicating a new street to finance street name signs at each and every
intersection.
   D.   Changes In Street Names:
      1.   Address Committee: The city’s address committee shall be comprised
of one (1) representative from each of the following agencies: city council,

recommendations to the city’s planning and zoning board of commissioners
concerning public health, safety, and welfare as it relates to addressing.
      3.   Where necessary or desirable, recommendations from the addressing
committee may be made to the commission to change a street name, or the
commission may do so at its discretion, for reasons of duplication, similar
pronunciation or spelling, or for other reasons relating to public safety or
convenience.
      4. Commission Determination: In the case of street name changes
necessitated due to duplication, similar pronunciation or spelling, the
commission shall determine the street to be changed and select the new name to
be used. In so doing, the commission shall take into consideration the number
of existing addresses on the streets in question, the length of time each
street has used the name in question, the date of the original dedication of
said streets and any other factors pertinent to the changes in question. The
commission may hold public hearings on such changes.
      5.   Check With Official Map And List: No street names may be changed
until the proposed ones have been checked with the official street name map and
list.
      6.   Avoid Inconvenience: All changes shall be made in such a manner so
as to create the least possible inconvenience to residents and property owners
in the area. No change shall become effective for at least thirty (30) days
after official action by the commission.

8-5-3: STREET ADDRESS NUMBERING:
All street address numbers shall conform to the grid system shown on the
official address number grid map kept on file at the city hall office.
   A.   Address Grid: The Blackfoot address grid comprises the following
characteristics and is so defined in order to establish and maintain
consistency in addressing standards within the City of Blackfoot.
      1.   The city of Blackfoot road system exists in two (2) general
orientations:
         a.   The downtown original blocks area where North/South Axis roads
are oriented at approximately North 40 degrees East, and East/West Axis roads
are oriented at approximately North 50 degrees West; and
         b.   Roads that are aligned in a predominately orthogonal (true north)
orientation outside the downtown blocks. Roads that run North and South, and
Northeast and Southwest shall be treated the same, and roads that run East and
West, and Northwest and Southeast shall be treated the same.
      2.   Origin : The North/South axis is defined as the Union Pacific
Railroad, and the East/West axis is defined as West and East Bridge Streets.
      3.   Extents: The extent of the Blackfoot address grid shall be the city
limits and shall dynamically evolve as annexations occur to include said
annexed areas. Note: This rule implies that former county addresses shall be
made to conform to the city address grid once they are annexed into the city.
      4.   Interval: Whereas the original downtown blocks were created as three
hundred fifty foot by three hundred fifty foot (350' x 350') on average, these
are used as the precedent throughout the city as being one hundred (100)
addresses per three hundred fifty feet (350').
      5.   Parity: Structures on northerly and westerly sides of roads shall be
addressed as odd, while structures along the easterly and southerly sides of
roads shall consistently be addressed as even throughout the entirety of the
address grid.

other person or organization, public or private, shall assign any address
number to any residence, business, industry or use.

subdivisions and shall otherwise be assigned in such a manner that adequate
numbers are reserved for possible future developments or resubdivisions of
land.
      3.   Street Frontage: All addresses shall be assigned on the street upon
which the structure fronts. When vehicular access is used from a point other
than the street frontage, the number shall be placed so as to be visible from
the street side of the building.
      4.   Even And Odd Numbers: All addresses one side of a street shall be
designated as either even or odd numbers, but not both.
      5.   Owner To Post Legible Numbers: The owner of each structure shall
post the assigned address number in such a manner that it is clearly visible
from the street. The numbers shall be at least three and one-half inches (31/
2") high. Numbers must be displayed prior to occupancy.
         a.   Address Numbers In Alleyways And On Multi-Occupancy Buildings:
Any building with an access door located in an alleyway or side street, or with
multiple access doors on a single building, or as ordered by the fire chief or
fire marshal, shall post the assigned address number in such a manner that it
is clearly visible and in accordance with the current fire code.
      6.   Change Of Nonconforming Numbers: Existing address numbers not in
conformance with the official address number grid system map may be changed by
the city council giving official written notice at least ninety (90) days in

service charges and fees for the authorized use of, and for service rendered
by, the municipal water system, and which charges and fees shall be as near as
possible, uniform as to the different users served by said municipal water
system. The rates, charges and fees provided by this chapter are hereby levied
and assessed against the authorized water user or owner, and his property,
having any water service connection with the municipal water system.
   B.   Property Subject To Charges: It is specifically enacted that all
improved property in the city to which the municipal water system is available,
but is not used by the owner or occupier of said parcel of land, is still
subject to user charges under the provisions of this chapter to cover the cost
of standby fire protection facilities and other benefits. (2003 Code § 9-01-14)
9-1-14: WATER USER AND EQUIVALENT CONNECTION:
Each user and parcel being subject to water user charges as provided for
hereinabove is assessed for the purpose of establishing the equivalent
connection rating and the monthly service charge or fee to be charged or
assessed to and against the property. The assessment takes into consideration
the estimated volume of water to be used, the uniformity of the use of the
water, the standby benefits of the water system for fire protection and for
other factors so as to as nearly as possible fix the rate, charge or fee upon
the same relative basis as is imposed upon other like property within the city
that has the municipal water service available. (2003 Code § 9-01-15)
9-1-15: CONNECTION TO CITY WATER SYSTEM OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS:
In order to obtain municipal water system service to parcels that are either
partially or entirely outside of the corporate city limits, the following
provisions must be complied with:
   A.   There shall be an application form which shall provide that the
applicant will agree to the terms and conditions required by this section as a
consideration for obtaining such service. The city council shall establish an
application fee, which fee shall be based upon various classes of applications
as recommended by the public works director given the amount of staff review
required for processing the application. The application form shall specify the
legal description of the parcels for which service is being applied, the name
and address of the legal owners of the parcels, and purpose of the requested
service.
   B.   A completed application must be filed with the public works department.
   C.   Following the filing of a completed application form and the payment of
the application fee, the public works director shall then review the
circumstances presented by the application in accordance with the terms and
conditions and regulations of this chapter as are relevant to the application
and which shall also include a review of the effect the granting of the
application will have on the ability of the municipal water system to provide
an acceptable level of service to developed parcels with existing service and
reasonable service capacity to be held in reserve for in city users.
   D.   The public works director shall then review the findings and
recommendations with the applicant for comment.
   E.   Upon being satisfied that the application for service is complete and
that all information needed to determine serviceability has been presented, the
public works director shall then submit the application and a report of
recommendations to the city council regarding the application. Nevertheless, if
the public works director determines that the proposed developments is not
serviceable, he may deny the application.
   F.   The city council, in the exercise of its discretion, may either grant
or deny the application after review of the application and the report of
recommendations of the public works director.
   G.   In the event the city council grants the application, it shall include
as a condition that the legal owners and/or applicable occupants of the parcels
shall enter into an agreement for the extension of domestic water service
outside the city limits (hereinafter in this section referred to as the
"agreement"), which agreement form shall provide that the legal owners of the
parcels agree that the provisions of the city's ordinances, regulations and
policies, and inspection fees, which appertain to the regulation, control and
use of its domestic water system, including hookup and service fees as apply to
terms of the "agreement", and which form shall also provide that the owners of
the parcels agree to the annexation into the city of the parcels serviced; and
the city council may also impose such other conditions of granting the
application as are reasonable to assure the protection of the level of service
to previously developed parcels within the city limits.
   H.   The water user of the parcels serviced pursuant to a granted
application under this section shall be considered a user and subject to the
terms and conditions of the agreement so long as the property being served
remains outside of the corporate limits of the city.
   I.   Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, if the requested
connection is for a residence, or a multi-family residence or commercial or
industrial user development that requires only a two inch (2") or smaller
service, and if water service is readily available to the affected parcel
without extension of service, then, if the public works director deems it in
the best interests of the city to do so, said connection may be authorized by
the public works director without action by the city council. If the director
declines to approve the connection, the request may, upon consent of the mayor,
proceed to the city council for final decision. (2003 Code § 9-01-16)
9-1-16: POWER OF MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL TO SET CHARGES:
The mayor and city council shall determine and set all applicable fees and
charges for use of the water system. Such fees and charges may be set by
resolution. (2003 Code § 9-01-17)
9-1-17: PURPOSE OF MONTHLY WATER USER CHARGE:
The monthly water user charge is established to cover administrative,
operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the system, and to provide a
fund to pay for capital improvement costs, additions, oversized extensions to
the system, or redemption of bonds that have been used to finance system
improvements, all as a part of the city's responsibility to provide adequate
domestic water service and facilities for the city. The monthly water user
charge shall be set by resolution of the city council and shall be effective
upon the date and time cited in the resolution. For new connections, the water
user charge is to begin when the connection to the city service line has been
inspected and approved, or within sixty (60) days after the city service line
has been installed, whichever is the earliest. (2003 Code § 9-01-18)
9-1-18: MONTHLY RATES:
   A.   User Charge:
      1.   All owners who receive or have the right to receive the benefit of
the municipal water system shall, in return for said benefit, pay monthly user
charges as described below. The monthly user charge shall be based on the
amount of water used and the amount of fire and health protection provided by
the municipal water supply system, plus the cost of reading the meters,
preparing and sending utility bills, collecting monthly fees, and administering
and overseeing the system by various city employees and contractors. The owners
of all property within the corporate limits, which property is within three
hundred feet (300') of the municipal water supply system or within six hundred
feet (600') of a fire hydrant, shall pay a minimum monthly user charge. The
minimum monthly user charge for all uses shall be based on the most recent cost
of service study. All other water service connections shall be prorated as to
the number of EDUs assigned to that water user by this chapter, or as
determined by the public works director, and will be computed on an individual
basis. Any user having more than one classification of use shall be charged for
the sum of classifications.
      2.   The minimum monthly user charge shall be set by resolution of the
city council and be based on an EDU unit. Any owner that has a total EDU rating
less than one shall pay a minimum monthly user charge for one full EDU. Any
owner which has an EDU rating greater than one shall pay a minimum monthly user
charge that is the product of that user's EDU rating multiplied by charge per
EDU. Example: A laundry having twelve (12) machines would have an equivalent
connection rating of 4.00 + (2 x 0.25) = 4.50 and a subsequent minimum monthly
user charge of (4.50) x ($ the charge per EDU).
      3.   Each owner will pay a monthly user fee based on the quantity of
water used and the schedule of water use fee in table I, as established by
resolution of the city council and on file in the city office. Each owner shall
pay, as full compensation for the benefits derived from the municipal water
supply system, the minimum monthly user fee or the monthly user fee, whichever
is greater. Should an owner request a city water service line to be
disconnected, for any reason, there shall be paid to the city a disconnection
fee as set by the water superintendent, with approval of the city council. The
owner must request the city to place the line back in service. There will be a
charge set by the water superintendent with approval of the city council
associated with the reactivation of the existing service line. All monthly
water rates will be charged against the property for which the city water
service line is installed. The owner of record is liable for that amount, which
must be paid before the water service is resumed. In the event an owner leaves
an unclaimed balance in his account, that amount shall be kept for six (6)
months, after which time it shall revert to the general fund of the city. The
owner of the property serviced shall pay for the monthly user charge and such
owner will be billed for such monthly user charge.
   B.   Charges For Water, Service Line Installations And Other Fees:
      1.   The charges for water shall be as set by resolution.
      2.   In case a water meter fails to register correctly the water used,
the owner shall pay for the water on the basis of the average reading of the
meter for the previous three (3) months. Water meter installation charges shall
be as follows:
         a.   For all meters and service lines installed, the charge shall be
set by the public works director. All installed meters shall be property of the
city.
         b.   Service applicability fees, as set by resolution by the city

copy of the industrial user agreement together with any plans, specifications
or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the city.
Industrial user permits shall be approved by the city council based on
recommendation by the engineer for the city. Approval shall be contingent upon
the availability of excess capacity in the wastewater treatment plant, the
provisions of this chapter and any other considerations the city council deems
appropriate. The amount of the permit, inspection fee and sewer availability
fee for an industrial wastes sewer service will vary with each permit and shall
be established by the city at the time of application.
   C.   Costs Borne By Owner; Liability: All costs and expense incident to the
installation and connection of the building sewer and service connection shall
be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify and hold harmless the city
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building sewer and the marking of the service connection
for same to the public sewer.
   D.   Separate Connections For Each Building: A separate and independent
building sewer and service connection shall be provided for every building;
except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and
no separate sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building
through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer.
   E.   Old Building Sewers: Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and being tested as
required by the city, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   F.   Conformance With Building And Plumbing Codes: The materials of
construction of the building sewer and service connections, and the methods to
be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling
the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing
codes as have been or may be adopted by the city.
   G.   Pipe Size; Building Sewer Grade And Slope: The building sewer from the
building drain to the public sewer and the service connection thereto shall not
be smaller than four inch (4") diameter sewer pipe.
      1.   Grade And Slope: The minimum grade or slope of the building sewer
shall be as follows:
         a.   Four inch (4") diameter sewer pipe shall be laid on a grade of
not less than one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot;
         b.   Six inch (6") diameter sewer pipe shall be laid on a grade of not
less than one-eighth inch (1/8") per foot; and
         c.   Eight inch (8") diameter sewer pipe shall be laid on a grade of
not less than four feet (4') per one thousand feet (1,000').
      2.   Alignment: The alignment of the building sewer from the outlet of
the building drain to the public sewer connection shall be straight, with no
bends, warps or sags permitted except with the permission of the city. The
trench bottom shall be cut to proper grade so that when the pipe is laid the
body or barrel of the pipe shall be on solid material. Bell holes are to be
excavated in the trench bottom at all pipe joints.
   H.   Connecting Surface Water Drainage To Building Sewer: No person shall
make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains
or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or
building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public
sanitary sewer.
   I.   Service Connection Requirements: The service connection to the public
sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing codes as
adopted by the city. In addition, the materials and workmanship of the service
connection shall meet the following requirements:
      1.   Precast Fittings: A precast service connection fitting shall be
installed as an increment of the sewer pipeline or installed as an external
fabrication to the sewer pipeline; said fabrication to be installed within the
center one-third (1/3) of an individual laying length of the public sewer pipe,
as a precaution in preventing the breaking of the bell or the spigot end of the
sewer pipe. The service connection fitting shall be installed as a watertight
connection to the public sewer, care being taken not to extend the building
sewer line into the public sewer line, therefore, creating a possible
restriction. The invert of the building sewer line at the service connection
fitting shall be at an elevation above the invert of the public sewer at least
equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the diameter of the public sewer. All foreign
material shall be removed from the sewer pipe and there shall be a permanent
connection which is airtight and watertight between the public sewer line and
the building sewer line.
      2.   Connection Tee:
         a.   The building sewer service connection fitting to reinforced sewer
pipelines shall be made as specified under subsection I1 of this section,
except that in cutting a hole in reinforced pipe for installation of the
service connection tee, extreme care shall be exercised to avoid damage to the
pipe. The hole for the tee shall be carefully chipped first to expose the
reinforcing steel and the steel cut by torch or saw. No chisel cutting of the
reinforcing steel of any character will be permitted.
         b.   In lieu of a standard service connection fitting, a riser service
connection may be made to sewer lines that are deep below ground surface. The
branch or riser shall be connected the same as a tee, except that it shall be
set vertically over the public sewer pipe, and extended vertically upward such
that the top of the riser is not to be less than five feet (5') below the
surface of the ground.
   J.   Notify City For Inspection: The applicant for the building sewer permit
shall notify the city when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer.
   K.   Guarding Excavations; Restoration: All excavations for building sewer
installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the city. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
   L.   Backwater Devices Required On New Service Connections:
      1.   Purpose: To prevent sanitary sewer overflows, from blockages or
sewer jetting of mainlines, for municipal sewer customers.
      2.   Installation:
         a.   Installation of a backwater valve, to prevent sewage from the
main sewer backing up into the private sewer lines due to cleaning or plugs in
the main, is required for all fixtures installed on a floor lower than the next
upstream manhole cover of the public or private sewer, serving such drainage
piping, shall be protected from backflow of sewage by installing an approved
type of blackwater valve. Fixtures on floor levels above such elevation shall
not discharge through the backwater valve. Cleanouts for drains that pass
through a backwater valve shall be clearly identified with a permanent label
stating “Backwater Valve Downstream.” In all:
            (1)   New construction,
            (2)   Replacements or repairs made to an existing sanitary sewer
lateral,
            (3)   Building permit applicants who are remodeling more than
twenty five percent (25%) of the structure area or where plumbing fixtures are
added to the property,
            (4)   Properties that have been damaged by the blockage of the city
sanitary sewer main or the private lateral,
            on all new structures where a pump is used to lift sewage to the
sanitary sewer system main line, the tie in to the building sewer shall be
downstream of the backwater valve.
      b.   Installation shall be completed in accordance with current Idaho
Statutes, administrative rules and plumbing code.
(Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014; amd. Ord. 2143, 5-3-2016, eff. 5-3-2016; Ord. 2188, 10-1-
2019)
9-3-12: INDUSTRIAL USERS:
All industrial users of the sewerage system shall comply with any applicable
requirements of sections 204(b), 307 and 308 of the federal water pollution
control act and 40 CFR 403. There shall be two (2) classes of industrial users:
a) major contributing industry, and b) minor contributing industry.
   A.   Contributing Industries Defined: The contributing industries are
defined as follows:
      1.   Major Contributing Industry: A major contributing industry is one
that:
         a.   Will contribute greater than ten percent (10%) of the design
hydraulic flow of the treatment works.
         b.   Will contribute greater than ten percent (10%) of the design
pollutant loading of the treatment works.
         c.   Has in its waste a toxic pollutant in toxic amounts as defined in
standards issued under section 307(a) of the act.
         d.   Has significant impact, either singly or in combination with
other contributing industries, on the sewerage system or the quality of its
effluent.
         e.   Is classified as a categorical industry or significant industry.
      2.   Minor Contributing Industry: A minor contributing industry shall be
all industries not included in the major contributing industry classification
as defined in subsection A1 of this section.
   B.   Requirements:
      1.   Monitoring Wastes: All major contributing industries' wastes shall
be monitored by the city or industry on a regular basis at intervals not less
than monthly, and more frequently as the characteristics of the specific
industrial discharge may dictate. Minor contributing industries shall be
monitored by the city or industry as the characteristics of the specific
industrial discharge may dictate as determined by the city.
      2.   Reports To City: All major contributing industries shall submit to
the city on the first day of the months of June and December, a statement in
writing regarding specific actions taken to achieve full compliance with the
requirements of section 307 of the act.
      3.   Report Changes In Flow Or Characteristics: Each contributing
industry shall report any substantial (exceeding 10 percent plus or minus)
change in flow or characteristics of wastewater being discharged into the
sewerage system. The report shall include quantity and quality of effluent and
duration and frequency of discharge. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-13: INSPECTION AND APPROVAL OF CONNECTIONS:
No connection of any kind to a public sewer line shall be made and no sewage
permitted to flow through such connection except pursuant to inspection of and
approval issued by the city. See section
9-3-11 of this chapter for sewer permits, inspection fees, inspection notices,
etc. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-14: REJECTION OF MATERIALS OR WORKMANSHIP:
The city may reject any material or workmanship for cause and, upon such order,
rejected material shall be removed and replaced with approved material.
Disapproved workmanship shall cause the removal and replacement of all
materials involved, including appurtenances, excavation, backfilling and other
work items. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-15: SEWER LINE EXTENSIONS:
   A.   Compliance With Master Plan: All proposed extensions of the municipal
sewerage system to serve undeveloped areas within the existing corporate
limits, newly annexed areas or areas outside the corporate limits shall comply
with the overall master plan for the municipal sewerage system.
   B.   Owner Responsible For Costs; Exception: Costs for all extensions which
lie outside the boundary limits of the property for which the extension is
requested shall be the responsibility of that property owner or his agent. Cost
for sewer extensions within the property for which the extension is requested
shall also be the responsibility of the owner or his agent. Sewer extensions
shall be required to extend to the farthest boundary of the development. When
it is necessary to install oversized lines as part of an extension, the cost of
all oversized lines will normally be the responsibility of the owner or his
agent. However, the city may, in its discretion, if it has uncommitted funds in
its sewer construction account, participate in a portion of the cost of any
oversized sewer lines.
   C.   Newly Developed Areas: Unless a special permit is granted by the city,
all municipal sewerage system extensions into newly developing areas shall be
installed prior to the construction of any new streets.
   D.   Compliance With City Specifications: All design and construction of any
extensions to the municipal sewerage system shall comply with the official
specifications for sewerage system extensions as adopted by the city.
   E.   Preparation And Filing Of Plans: The plans for all extensions to the
sewerage system shall be prepared as per the licensing requirements of Idaho
Code. Three (3) copies of the said plans shall be filed with the city. Two (2)
copies of the plans shall be filed with the state department of environmental
quality for their review and approval as required by Idaho Code. In approving a
plan for extension to the municipal sewerage system, the city reserves the
right to stipulate other requirements such as a special permit fee, rights of
way limits, sequence of construction, time limits for having existing service
disrupted, the filing of a performance bond and other similar measures as may
be required to protect the public. No work shall commence on any such extension
of the municipal sewerage system until the extension project has been approved
by the city.
   F.   Certification By Registered Engineer: After the construction of any
municipal sewer system extensions, it shall be the obligation of the owner, or
his agent, to have a registered professional engineer certify to the city and
to the state department of health and welfare that the said system extensions
were installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications on file
with the respective agencies. Following certification by the registered
professional engineer and acceptance by the city, the entire extension of the
municipal sewerage system, including the city sewer service lines, shall become
the property of the city and it shall be the city's responsibility to maintain
and operate the system thereafter.
   G.   Connections Made After Extension Accepted: If it is necessary for the
city to permit a sewer service connection and/or sewer service line at any time
after the extension has been originally accepted by the city, the owner or his
agent shall be required to pay the sewer availability fee as well as the
standard permit and inspection fees as may be established by the city for such
purposes. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-16: BACKFILLING:
Backfilling of building sewers and service connections within the limits of
public rights of way or easements shall conform to special specifications
promulgated by the city, for sewer installation, and shall be subject to
inspection by and approval of the city. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-17: SEWER EQUIVALENCY FEE:
   A.   Payment Of Fee Required: Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this
chapter, any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association or property
owner who has not otherwise paid for, or contributed proportionately toward,
the costs and expenses of constructing a sewer line, whether that construction
has been performed by the city, a local improvement district or a private
entity, or combination thereof, and who subsequently desires to connect to the
city sewer system, shall be required to pay a sewer equivalency fee. In
determining who has or has not paid, or contributed proportionately, toward the
costs and expenses of constructing a sewer line, the sole factor shall be
whether that user, or a predecessor in title of the user's property, has in
fact, paid consideration to the city in cash, services or in-kind, for the
construction of the sewer trunk line to which he now desires to connect, which
consideration is commensurate with what the user, or his predecessor in title,
would have paid under this section had the user not paid or contributed
previously to the cost of construction of the sewer line.
   B.   Fee Set By City Council: The sewer equivalency fee for each parcel of
ground connected to a trunk sewer line shall be established and set by the city
council, which shall consider the use to which the property will be put, the
expected flows, the amount of capacity of the trunk line that will be used by
the proposed use, and the type of effluent. The council also shall take into
consideration the amount of land that might be able to be serviced by the trunk
sewer line, whether the land be directly adjacent to the trunk line or not, and
also shall take into consideration the cost of the engineering and construction
of the trunk line, in current dollars, and shall consider the interest that
could have been earned on the money used to pay for the original sewer line.
The sewer equivalency fee may be different for residential, commercial, and
industrial users and may be different for differing users within those three
(3) classifications depending upon the considerations referenced above but
shall be as consistent as possible under similar factual circumstances. The
sewer equivalency fee shall be assessed in terms of single-family equivalent
connections. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-18: COOPERATIVE AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Reimbursement To Sewer User: Should a sewer user at his own expense
construct an extension to the sewer system in a public right of way or easement
with prior approval of the city and in accordance with the standards and
designs of the city and which sewer line extension has been determined by the
city to be able to benefit properties other than the user's, the sewer user
constructing the extension may request that the city enter into an agreement
with the user such that all or a portion of the costs of extending the sewer
line will be reimbursed to that sewer user from the connection charges
collected under section
9-3-17 of this chapter from those property owners who will benefit from the
sewer line extension and who otherwise have not paid or contributed their
proportionate share of the construction costs of that sewer line and who are
required to pay the sewer equivalency fee. The city shall not be required to
enter into such an agreement and whether or not to enter into such an agreement
shall be at the sole discretion of the city council; provided, however, that:
      1.   No reimbursement agreement shall have a duration greater than ten
(10) years, unless the city is a beneficiary of the agreement.
      2.   No reimbursement agreement shall pay to the sewer user paying for or
constructing a sewer line extension more than one hundred percent (100%) of his
actual engineering and construction costs, it being noted that in most cases at
least some of the cost would ordinarily be assessed to the sewer user's own
property.
      3.   A reimbursement agreement may provide for interest to be paid to the
sewer user.
      4.   The city may charge and may receive a ten percent (10%)
administrative fee for handling the accounting, auditing, and payment of the
reimbursement payments made to the sewer user so extending the sewer line and
having reached a reimbursement agreement with the city.
      5.   All or a part of the sewer equivalency fee associated with the sewer
line constructed and paid pursuant to section
9-3-17 of this chapter may be set aside and earmarked for reimbursement
pursuant to a reimbursement agreement.
      6.   The reimbursement agreement shall be personal to the sewer user
entering into it and shall not be assigned without the written consent of the
city, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
      7.   The agreement will terminate when the user has been fully reimbursed
if the agreed upon reimbursement amount is paid prior to the end of the term of
the agreement.
      8.   The agreement shall be binding on the sewer user and his assigns,
successors, heirs and executors and may be recorded as an encumbrance against
the property of the sewer user.
      9.   The sewer user shall be required to indemnify and hold the city
harmless from any and all liability whatsoever until the sewer line has been
accepted for maintenance by the city.
      10.   Said lines, after acceptance, shall become part of the city
sewerage system and be the sole property of the city.
   B.   Reimbursement To City: Where the city constructs a sewer line
extension, either on its own or in conjunction with another person or entity,
the city may enter into a reimbursement agreement as authorized in subsection A
of this section such that the city is reimbursed for its costs of construction,
engineering, legal costs and interest. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-19: BASIS FOR SEWER CHARGES:
   A.   System Of Charges Established: There hereby is established a system of
connector charges, permit and inspection fees, industrial cost recovery
charges, periodic service charges and other fees for the use of, and for
service rendered by the sewerage works of the city, and which charges, rates
and fees shall be as near as possible, uniform as to the different classes of
property served by said sewerage works. The rates, charges and fees provided by
this chapter hereby are levied and assessed against each lot, parcel of land,
building, building unit, apartment, or property having any connection with the
sanitary sewerage works of the city or otherwise discharging sanitary sewage,
industrial wastewater or other liquids directly into the sanitary sewerage
works of the city. The rates, charges and fees shall be billed to and paid by
the registered owner of each lot, parcel of land, building or property served
by the sewerage system.
   B.   Properties Subject To Charges: It specifically is enacted that all
property in the city to which a public sewer is available and is required to
connect to the sewer as required in section
9-3-8 of this chapter, but is not used by the owner or occupier of said parcel
of land, nevertheless is subject to user charges under the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 2122, 5-6-2014)
9-3-20: POWER OF MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL TO SET CHARGES:
The mayor and city council shall determine and set all applicable fees and
charges for use of the sewer system. This chapter supplants and replaces
resolution 240 and amendments thereto. The city currently does not have the
technology or ability to measure each class's exact use of the sewer system.
Therefore, the rates are based on an estimate of each class's contribution or
potential contribution to the loading of the sewer system. A multiplier is
assigned to each class pursuant to the table set forth below. The multiplier is
not based solely on the amount of water used and discharged into the system,
but rather, takes into consideration other factors such as the estimated amount
of BODs, CODs, suspended solids, and other contaminates that may be discharged
into the system by the various classes of users, and the estimated number and
types of users under each classification. To determine the monthly sewer
charge, the multiplier (or equivalent residential unit, as it is sometimes
called) is multiplied by the rate set from time to time by the city council by
resolution or ordinance. The chart below may also be used in determining the
sewer availability fee for new users to the system, regardless of the pipe size
or number of connections to the city's sewerage system.

This table, along with applicable charges per multiplier or equivalent
residential unit may be amended from time to time by resolution of the city
council. Commercial users not included in the table shall be considered to be
industrial users and shall be charged rates based on applicable industrial
waste agreements. Any of the users in the table may be classified as industrial
users if information on their contribution flow and/or strength indicates a
need to do so. A single user having more than one classification of use shall
be the sum of the fees. The minimum monthly sewer charge shall be one
equivalent residential unit. A reassessment of each commercial user will be
completed at a minimum of once every five (5) years. Within thirty (30) days of

such notice, permanently cease all violations and if necessary make all
corrections and repairs to the system or pay for same if the city has to make
the corrections or repairs.
   B.   Penalty Imposed: Any person who shall continue any violation, beyond
the time limit provided for in subsection A of this section, shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to penalty as
provided in title 1, chapter 4 of this code, for each violation. Each day in
which such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
   C.   Liability To City For Loss Or Damage: Any person violating any of the
provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense,
loss, or damage occasioned by the city by reason of such violation and, for
other than nonpayment of sewer bill violations, may have their sewer and water
supply terminated after the above three (3) working day notice period has
expired.
   D.   Cumulative Penalties: These penalties shall not be construed to be
exclusive, but shall be construed to be cumulative of, and in addition to, any
other penalties provided for in this code or the criminal code of the state; as
an example, a person injuring the sewer system could be criminally charged with
malicious injury to property for all violations initially charged as a criminal
violation, the notice provisions provided for in this chapter shall not apply.

discharges from other sources, either: a) inhibits or disrupts the POTW, its
treatment processes or operations; b) inhibits or disrupts its sludge
processes, use or disposal; or c) is a cause of a violation of the city NPDES
permit or of the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal in compliance with
any of the following statutory/regulatory provisions or permits issued
thereunder (or more stringent state or local regulations): section 405 of the
clean water act; the solid waste disposal act (SWDA), including title II,
commonly referred to as the resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA); any
state regulations contained in any state sludge management plan prepared
pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA; the clean air act; the toxic substances
control act; and the marine protection, research and sanctuaries act.
IPDES: Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
LIQUID WASTE: The discharge from any fixture, appliance or appurtenance in
connection with a plumbing system which does not receive fecal matter.

NEW SOURCE:
   A.   Any building, structure, facility or installation from which there is
(or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced
after the publication of proposed categorical pretreatment standards under
section 307(c) of the act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section; provided,
that:
      1. The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at a
site at which no other source is located; or
      2. The building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the
process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an
existing source; or
      3. The production or wastewater generating processes of the building,
structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of an
existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection A2 or A3 of this definition, but otherwise alters, replaces or adds
to existing process or production equipment.
   C.   Construction of a new source, as defined herein, has commenced if the
owner or operator has:
      1. Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on site construction
program:

or
         b. Significant site preparation work, including clearing, excavation
or removal of existing buildings, structures or facilities which is necessary
for the placement, assembly or installation of new source facilities or
equipment; or
      2. Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering
and design studies, do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
definition.
NEW USER: A user that is not regulated under federal categorical pretreatment
standards, but that applies to the city for a new building permit or occupies
an existing building and plans to commence discharge of wastewater to the city
collection system after the effective date hereof. Any person that buys an

sand, cellar dirt, agricultural and industrial wastes, and the characteristics
of the wastewater, i.e., pH, temperature, TSS, turbidity, color, BOD, chemical
oxygen demand (COD), toxicity or odor.
PRETREATMENT: The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means (except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard).

wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of the pipe). All concentrations for
metallic substances are for "total" metal, unless indicated otherwise. The
superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to (or in place of) the
concentration based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more
stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply. (Ord. 2078, 6-
3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4A-5: CITY RIGHT OF REVERSION:

9-4A-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting
out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. Such agreement
shall be in writing and in no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement.
However, users may request a net/gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR section 403.15. They may also request a variance from
the categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority in accordance

9-4A-7: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users that he
believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4A-8: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:

more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable
to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the
city under the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   In addition, the superintendent may establish best management
practices (BMPs) for particular groups of users. These BMPs may include, but
are not limited to, types or methods of pretreatment technology to be used,
methods of source control, minimum maintenance requirements, spill prevention
practices, or other requirements as deemed necessary.
   B.   Failure To Maintain: If a failure to maintain any GRS results in
partial or complete blockage of the building sewer, private sewer system
discharging to the city sewer system, or other parts of the city sewer system,
or adversely affects the treatment or transmission capabilities of the POTW, or
requires excessive maintenance by the city, or poses a possible health hazard,
the discharger responsible for the facilities shall be subject to the remedies
herein, including cost recovery, enforcement and penalties. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-
2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4A-9: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Specified: Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical
pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard
is effective, unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any
existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any
categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than
the federal categorical pretreatment standards.
   B.   New Sources And Users: New sources and new users are required to comply
with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time (not
to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge). New sources and new users
shall install, have in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before
beginning to discharge.
   C.   Industrial Waste Acceptance Permit: Any industrial waste acceptance
permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond
any deadline date established in EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. Any
other existing user or a categorical user that must comply with a more
stringent local limit which is in noncompliance with any local limits shall be
provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial waste acceptance
permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time feasible. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-
2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4A-10: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Restrictions May Be Imposed: Whenever deemed necessary, the
superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow
periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Discharge Storage And Flow Control Facility: Each user discharging into
the POTW greater than ten thousand (10,000) gallons per day or greater than ten
percent (10%) of the average daily flow into the POTW, whichever is less, shall
install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage
and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty four
(24) hour period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least ten percent
(10%) of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a
rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the
superintendent. An industrial waste acceptance permit may be issued solely for
flow equalization.
   C.   Interceptors: Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when,
in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand,
except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent
and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as
needed, by the user at its expense.
   D.   Combustible Gas Detection Meter: Users with the potential to discharge
flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved
combustible gas detection meter.
   E.   Chemical Storage: Pollutants, chemicals, substances, or wastewater as
defined in
9-4A-1 shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW accidentally or otherwise. All substances that may be
defined by
9-4A-1 shall:
      1.   Be properly labeled, with legible and easily accessible labels;
      2.   Be contained by proper spill containment; or
      3.   Have pretreatment processes that would mitigate any spilled
substance.
   F.   The city may require the facility to add additional spill containment,
spill kit, or other means of mitigating spills in any chemical storage area
that the city determines to be inadequate to effectively protect the sewer and
treatment plant.
(Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008; amd. Ord. 2188, 10-1-2019)
9-4A-11: GREASE REMOVAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
All FSEs and NFDs shall have an adequate grease removal system installed and
exercise proper kitchen best management practices to ensure that excess
concentrations of FOG are not discharged to the POTW.
   A.   New Construction: All new construction FSEs and NFDs shall submit
plumbing plans for all potential grease discharging lines, all GRSs, and
connecting piping to the superintendent or his designee for approval prior to
construction. The plumbing shall be installed in accordance with the approved
plans. Failure to submit plans or construct is accordance with approved plans
is a violation of this chapter:
      1.   All new user food service establishment single occupancy buildings
shall install properly sized interceptor style grease removal systems. Where
bona fide space or gradient limitations make the use of an interceptor style
GRS impractical, and with prior approval of the superintendent, an FSE may
install properly sized trap style GRSs. All kitchen drains and any other drains
that may carry grease laden waste shall be connected to this GRS (except the
dishwasher if a trap style GRS is installed). If a trap style GRS is installed,
the kitchen may not have a garbage disposal/garbage grinder/macerator or
similar unit installed.
      2.   All new construction multi-tenant buildings (strip centers) shall
include a separate waste line for all leasable spaces that discharges to a
common one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallon or larger interceptor. When a
space is leased, sold or rented to an FSE or NFD, all kitchen drains and any
other drains that may carry grease laden waste shall be connected to this waste
line; no domestic sewage may be connected to this line. The property owner
shall be responsible for proper maintenance of this interceptor in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
      3.   All new user non-FSE FOG discharger single occupancy buildings shall
install a properly sized GRS. Interceptor style GRSs are recommended, but trap
style GRSs are permissible. All kitchen drains and any other drains that may
carry grease laden waste shall be connected to this GRS (except the dishwasher
if a trap style GRS is installed). If a trap style GRS is installed, the
kitchen may not have a garbage disposal, garbage grinder, macerator or similar
unit installed.
      4.   Any FSE or NFD undertaking a "substantial remodel", as defined in
section
9-4-1-3 of this chapter, will be considered to be new construction for the
purposes of this chapter.
   B.   Existing Users:
      1.   Any existing FSE without a functional GRS shall be required to
install one. The type of GRS required will be determined by the superintendent,
taking into account cost, available space and gradient, whether the user is in
a grease impact area, and any other pertinent information. Where feasible, all
kitchen drains and any other drains that may carry grease laden waste shall be
connected to this GRS (except the dishwasher if a trap style GRS is installed).
If a trap style GRS is installed, the kitchen may not have a garbage disposal,
garbage grinder, macerator or similar unit installed.
      2.   Any existing NFD without a functional GRS may be required to install
one. The type of GRS required will be determined by the superintendent, taking
into account cost, available space and gradient, whether the user is in a
grease impact area, and any other pertinent information. Where feasible, all
kitchen drains and any other drains that may carry grease laden waste shall be
connected to this GRS (except the dishwasher if a trap style GRS is installed).
If a trap style GRS is installed, the kitchen may not have a garbage disposal,
garbage grinder, macerator or similar unit installed.
   C.   Grease Removal System Maintenance:
      1.   All grease removal systems shall be maintained to ensure proper
operation. At a minimum, interceptor style GRSs shall be cleaned at least once
every ninety (90) days, and trap style GRSs cleaned at least once per week.
These required frequencies may be extended with the approval of the
superintendent. Grease removal systems must be cleaned whenever the combined
thickness of the floating greases and settled solids is equal to, or greater
than, twenty five percent (25%) of the total liquid depth in the GRS.
      2.   All facilities performing maintenance on GRSs shall maintain log
books and pumping records. These should be readily available for review by the
control authority.
      3.   When cleaned, an interceptor style GRS must be completely pumped
out, all solids removed, solidified grease scraped from the interior and the
structure and all internal plumbing inspected for damage and corrosion. The GRS
shall be refilled with water prior to being placed back into operation. If
repairs are required, they shall be performed within seven (7) days.
      4.   Trap style GRSs may be maintained by the FSE or NFD. When cleaned,
the trap must have surface grease and oil removed, settled solids removed, all
sides scraped, removable parts removed and cleaned, be inspected for damage and
corrosion, and be properly reassembled. If repairs are required, they shall be
performed within seven (7) days.
      5.   The material that is removed in the process of cleaning a GRS shall
not be discharged back into the GRS, any part of the POTW, any private sewer,
any drainage piping or storm sewer system. All materials removed shall be
handled and disposed of in accordance with federal, state, county and local
laws, rules and regulations.
      6.   In addition to the maintenance required above, automatic grease
removal systems shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's
guidelines.
   D.   Grease Removal System Additives:
      1.   No user may use an additive of any type for the GRS without the
approval of the superintendent. The superintendent will adopt procedures for
the approval of additives.
      2.   No vendor may sell, attempt to sell or otherwise distribute any
additive in the city without prior approval of the additive by the
superintendent. Any vendor selling, or attempting to sell, or otherwise
distributing any additive intended for use in a GRS that has not been approved
for use by the superintendent is in violation of this chapter and is subject to
all enforcement actions contained herein.
   E.   Grease Removal System Sizing:
      1.   Trap style grease removal systems shall be sized in accordance with
the standards in the adopted plumbing code.
      2.   The minimum size for an interceptor style grease removal system
shall be determined using the following formula:
      Size (gallons) = 5D X 0.5HR X LF
      Where D = number of seats in dining area, FSEs that typically sell
takeaway meals shall use a D of 50; HR = the number of hours of operation per
day; and LF = the loading factor. The loading factor will be 0.5 except when
the FSE or NFD is in a grease impact area or when a garbage disposal, garbage
grinder, macerator or similar unit is installed; then a factor of 1.0 will be
used.
      3.   In no case shall an interceptor smaller than one thousand (1,000)
gallons be installed without prior approval of the superintendent. If a garbage
disposal, garbage grinder, macerator or similar unit is installed, the minimum
size is one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons to adequately retain the
added settleable solids loading.
      4.   The maximum size for an interceptor shall be one thousand five
hundred (1,500) gallons. If the calculated minimum size is larger than this,
two (2) interceptors of approximately equal size shall be installed in series.
If the calculated minimum size is larger than three thousand (3,000) gallons,
two (2) 1,500-gallon interceptors shall be installed in series.
(Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008; amd. Ord. 2188, 10-1-2019)
9-4A-12: ACCIDENTAL SPILL PREVENTION PLANS:
The superintendent may require any user to develop and implement an accidental
spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by
the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of
pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city
for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which
user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within
thirty (30) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its
ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved
by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility
as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Plan Requirements: Any user required to develop and implement an
accidental spill prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a
minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards in sections
9-4A-1 through
9-4A-4 of this article;
      4.   Significant industrial users are required to notify the POTW
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug
discharge; and
      5.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Notice Of Accident: Users shall notify the city wastewater treatment
plant immediately after the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of
substances regulated by this chapter. The notification shall include location
of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss
or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the
city on account thereof under state or federal law.
   C.   Written Report Of Accident: Within five (5) days following an
accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by
this chapter or other applicable law.
   D.   Signage: Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or
accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.

the POTW only at a designated receiving structure within the treatment plant
area, and at such times as are established by the superintendent. Such wastes
shall not violate this section or any other requirements established or adopted
by the city. Industrial waste acceptance permits for individual vehicles to use
such facilities shall be issued by the superintendent.
   B.   Location; Consent; Analysis: Septic tank waste haulers may only
discharge loads at locations specifically designated by the superintendent. No
load may be discharged without prior consent of the superintendent. The
superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards. The superintendent may require the
hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   C.   Waste Tracking Form: Septic tank waste haulers must provide a waste
tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name
and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, sources
of waste and volume and characteristics of waste.
   D.   Fees: Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the
user fee system as authorized in section
9-4-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4A-14: RV DUMPING REGULATIONS:
   A.   Acceptance: RV sewage waste may be introduced into the POTW only at
designated receiving structures throughout the city. Such wastes shall not
violate this section or any other requirements established or adopted by the
city. Dump sites are in locations specifically designated by the

ARTICLE D. SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
SECTION:
9-4D-1: Sampling Requirements For Users
9-4D-2: Analytical Requirements
9-4D-3: City Monitoring Of User's Wastewater
9-4D-1: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be
representative of the discharge and the decision to allow alternative sampling
must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a
twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: For cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the city, as appropriate.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90)
day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR section 403.12(e) and (h),
the city shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements.
   C.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by
the city and specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For
categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater
prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations
necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR section
403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its
local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standards.
   D.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling,
and methods of analysis and shall certify that the waste stream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in
its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR part 136, it
must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of
its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4D-2: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in

9-4E-1: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this chapter, and any industrial waste acceptance permit
or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with
all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   A.   Permitting Entrance: Where a user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted
to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   B.   Devices For Monitoring: The superintendent shall have the right to set
up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   Removal Of Obstructions: Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe
and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the
superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the user.
   D.   Delays: Delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-
2008)
9-4E-2: MONITORING FACILITIES:
   A.   Required; Location: Each user shall provide and operate at its own
expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurements of each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility
shall be situated on the user's premises, except, where such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the city may concur with
the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area;
providing, that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. The superintendent, whenever applicable, may
require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other
locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line or a wastewater
treatment system).
   B.   Maintenance Of Facility: There shall be ample room in or near such
sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, including the sampling and measuring equipment, shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the
expense of the user.
   C.   Agreement For Maintenance By City: The superintendent may enter into an
agreement to maintain the sampling and metering devices for the facility, once
such devices meet the standard set forth by the superintendent. The cost of
such maintenance shall be borne by the industry through monthly billing. Such
billing rates shall be comprised of the replacement cost of the equipment over
a reasonable time period, plus reasonable inflation, divided by the life
expectancy of the device in months.
   D.   Monitoring Equipment: The superintendent may require the user to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction
standards and specifications.
   E.   Calibration Of Devices: All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations
to ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4E-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any industrial waste acceptance permit
or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the superintendent shall seek issuance of a
search and/or seizure warrant from the Bingham County district court. Such
warrant shall be served at any hour that flow is being discharged from the
facility by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of
the city or of the county. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4E-4: VANDALISM:

When the superintendent finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste acceptance permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation via
certified letter. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by
the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff.
6-3-2008)
9-4F-2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
9-4F-4 and
9-4F-5 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent
order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4F-3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent may order via a certified letter a user which has violated
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste
acceptance permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4F-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste acceptance permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in
the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance
of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4F-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste acceptance permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-
2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4F-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste acceptance permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) a day for each violation, imprisonment not to exceed six
(6) months, or both such fine and imprisonment. Such fines shall be assessed on
a per violation, per day basis.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half
percent (11/2%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought
for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the superintendent to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine
amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the superintendent shall convene a hearing on the matter within
thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008; amd. Ord. 2188, 10-1-2019)
9-4F-7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal
notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice
and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent shall allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in section
9-4F-8 of this article are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections
9-4F-3 and
9-4F-8 of this article.
   C.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008,
eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4F-8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (NONEMERGENCY):
   A.   In addition to the provisions in section
9-4B-11 of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      1.   Violation of industrial waste acceptance permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in article A of this
chapter.
   B.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section
9-4F-3 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)

pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city
enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008; amd. 2012 Code, Ord. 2188, 10-1-2019)
9-4G-2: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
   A.   Performance Bonds: The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue
an industrial waste acceptance permit to any user which has failed to comply
with any provision of this chapter, a previous industrial waste acceptance
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the
city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
   B.   Liability Insurance: The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue
an industrial waste acceptance permit to any user which has failed to comply
with any provision of this chapter, a previous industrial waste acceptance
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial
assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its
discharge.
   C.   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial waste acceptance permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   D.   Public Nuisances: A violation of any provision of this chapter, an
industrial waste acceptance permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, hereby is declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent. Any person

ARTICLE H. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
SECTION:
9-4H-1: Upset
9-4H-2: Prohibited Discharge Standards
9-4H-3: Bypass
9-4H-1: UPSET:
   A.   Upset Defined: For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond
the reasonable control of the user. An "upset" does not include noncompliance
to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or
careless or improper operation.
   B.   Affirmative Defense: An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense
to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards
if the requirements of subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   Conditions: A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within 5 days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Judicial Determination: Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards.
   F.   Production Control Required: Users shall control production of all
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of their treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4H-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections 9-4A-1A and
9-4A-1B3 through B7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and
that either: a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-
through or interference; or b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not
change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff. 6-3-2008)
9-4H-3: BYPASS:
   A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
    BYPASS: The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   Bypass Permitted: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this
section.
   C.   Notice Of Bypass:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass,
if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   Bypass Conditions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 2078, 6-3-2008, eff.

collection, transportation and disposal. It shall be unlawful for any person to
engage in the business of collecting, transporting, hauling or conveying any

accumulated on his own premises, subject to all regulations herein contained.
An individual or entity may be granted a special exception from the mandatory

cannot reasonably accommodate the collection of the individual's or entity's
waste. Upon being granted the exception, the waste collector must comply with
the license, contract and franchise provisions of this chapter. The fact that
another waste collector is willing to collect the waste for a price less than
the price set by the city shall not be a factor in determining whether the
city, its licensee or franchisee can reasonably accommodate the collection of
the individual's or entity's waste. All owners or occupants of premises within
the city limits will be charged the minimum collection charge, regardless of
whether they actually use the collection system provided by the city.

accumulation in or about any premises or upon any street, alley or public way

Section 302.8.1.1 Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for
removal of certain nuisances created by vehicles and other materials when
stored improperly on public streets or private property and to distinguish
between the lawful use of public streets for parking of motor vehicles and the
public nuisance created by unlawful storage or parking of prohibited items.
Section 3.02.8.1.2 Definitions: For the purposes of this chapter:
   A.   Inoperative Vehicle: Any vehicle which, in its current state, whether
due to broken, defective, or missing parts, including missing or flat tires,
missing doors, missing or badly damaged windshields, or broken or defective
parts which are essential for movement, is not capable of being used as a

and its lawfully connected trailer, including, but not limited to, the
following: any snowmobile, any boat, any trailer which is not connected by
means of a lawful hitch to an operating, lawfully registered motor vehicle, any
camper shell or camper not mounted on a vehicle, any storage containers,
excluding city authorized garbage containers when located in conformance with
city regulations, any vehicle reported stolen and not yet recovered, and any
recreational vehicle which remains parked on a street longer than authorized in
this code.
   C.   Unregistered Vehicle: Any vehicle which is not lawfully and currently
registered as provided in Idaho Code title 49, chapter 4; or any vehicle which
does not bear current annual Idaho license plates or decals; or any vehicle
which does not bear current license plates issued by another state and is not

regulations set out elsewhere in this code.
   B.   The use of the streets as a storage location for unregistered or
inoperative motor vehicles, unauthorized items such as camper shells, boats,
unhitched trailers, storage containers, or other materials is prohibited and
the owner(s) may be issued a misdemeanor citation for violating the
prohibition. The continued presence of such unlawfully stored items is inimical
to the well being of the citizens and is hereby declared a public nuisance. All
such items shall be subject to removal as provided hereinafter, the costs of
which, including storage, shall be borne by the owner(s).
Section 3.02.8.1.4 Removal From Public Right Of Way:

Section 3.02.8.1.5 Use Of Private Property For Storage Of Unregistered Or
Inoperative Vehicles Or Vehicle Parts Prohibited And Declared A Public
Nuisance:
The long term presence on private property outside the confines of enclosed
buildings, of inoperative, wrecked, discarded, partially dismantled, junked,
unused, or unregistered vehicles or vehicle parts contributes to blight and
deterioration of neighborhoods and is detrimental to public health, safety, and
welfare due to factors such as broken glass, standing water, accumulation of
rusted parts, potential environmental damage, and the potential for breeding of
vermin, and is hereby deemed a public nuisance. No person in charge or control
of any property within the city, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or
otherwise, shall allow any such vehicle to remain in the open on such property
longer than seventy two (72) hours. Persons violating this prohibition may be
issued a misdemeanor citation and the city may pursue other legal remedies for
removal of the vehicles. This prohibition shall not apply to a vehicle on the
premises of a lawfully operated auto salvage business, auto repair business,
towing and storage business, auto sales business, or governmentally operated
auto storage area, when necessary to the operation of such business enterprise,
nor to vehicles for which a repair or restoration permit has been issued as
provided hereinafter.
Section 3.02.8.1.6 Temporary Exceptions For Repair And Restoration Permits:
The code enforcement staff are hereby authorized to issue permits for either
restoration work on an inoperative vintage or classic car or repair of one
inoperative vehicle and a salvage vehicle and such vehicle parts as may be
necessary for repair under the conditions established in this section. Code
enforcement staff is authorized to deny such permits to an owner if the
property on which the work will be done is not in compliance with property
maintenance regulations set out in this ordinance. Code enforcement staff is
also authorized to revoke any permit if the owner violates the terms of the
permit or property maintenance provisions in this ordinance and does not
correct the violations within the time prescribed.
   A.   Repair Permit: The code enforcement staff may issue a thirty (30) day
permit to allow the owner of a vehicle to repair that vehicle on his
residential premises by salvaging parts/equipment from another vehicle owned by
him, without storing and/or working on the vehicles in an enclosed building.
There shall be no cost for the permit. Members of the code enforcement staff
are authorized to issue one 30-day extension if requested by the permittee in
order to complete the repair, provided permittee is in compliance with the
terms of the permit and the property maintenance provisions in this ordinance.
If no enclosed building is available, storage and work on the vehicles should
be accomplished within the confines of a carport or an area screened from
public view. When not in an enclosed building and not undergoing actual repair
work, both vehicles must be under a car cover which has been specifically made
to fit the contours of and cover the entire body of the vehicle; blankets,
tarpaulins, or other such makeshift coverings are not allowed. Vehicle parts,
equipment, and tools must be neatly stacked and covered when work is not taking
place. At the expiration of the permit or its extension period, the salvage
vehicle must be removed from the premises or the code enforcement staff may
cause a misdemeanor citation to be issued and may also pursue other legal
remedies to effect the removal. Nothing herein shall be construed to allow any
person to perform such work in order to sell the repaired vehicle to another
party. 
   B.   Restoration Permit: The code enforcement staff may issue a one year
permit to allow the owner of a vehicle to undertake a project to restore a
vehicle as either a "classic" car (a vehicle at least 30 years old) or an
"Idaho old timer" (a vehicle manufactured prior to January 1, 1943) to its
original condition without storing the vehicle and working on it within an
enclosed building. If possible, work must be performed within the confines of a
carport or within a screened area. If not kept in an enclosed building, the
vehicle must be covered with a car cover as described in subsection A of this
section whenever work is not taking place. Members of the code enforcement
staff are authorized to issue one 180-day extension if requested by the
permittee in order to complete the repair, provided permittee is in compliance
with the terms of the permit and the property maintenance provisions in this
chapter. At the expiration of the permit or its extension period, if the
vehicle is not fully restored to working condition, the owner must either store
the vehicle in a fully enclosed building or remove the vehicle from the
property. Failure to do so may result in issuance of a misdemeanor citation and
the city may pursue other legal remedies to effect the removal.

10-6-11: DOWNTOWN SIGN DESIGN STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES:
   A.   Downtown Sign Design Standards Adopted: The downtown sign design
standards are hereby adopted and on file in the City. In the event of a
conflict between the downtown sign design standards and this section, this
section shall govern. In the event of a conflict between the downtown sign
design standards and other provisions of this chapter, the downtown sign design
standards shall govern.
   B.   Purpose And Intent: The purpose and intent of the downtown sign design
standards is to promote economic vitality and enhance property values and the
visual environment in the downtown, protect and promote the historic character
of the downtown through appropriate sign design, and encourage unique,
creative, and innovative signs that are compatible and coordinated, making the
downtown more unified.
   C.   Downtown Design Board (DDB): If created by City Council, the following
provisions shall apply:
      1.   Composition: The City Council may create a Downtown Design Board
(DDB). If the City Council does create such a board, the DDB shall be composed
of those appointed by City Council to serve as the voting members of the DDB
Board of Directors (DDB Board). The DDB bylaws, to be adopted, may provide that
the DDB Board is comprised of seven (7) voting members appointed by the City
Council and two (2) ex officio members. The bylaws shall also provide that one
DDB Board member is a member of the City Council, and the remaining board
members are people who reside in, or represent businesses located in, the
downtown area.
      2.   Executive Director: The Executive Director ("Director") of the DDB
shall be the person appointed by the DDB Board, with approval by the City
Council, to be the Executive Director of the DDB. This officer is an employee
and the Chief Executive Officer of the DDB and has general supervision over its
functions, and is not a member of the DDB Board.
      3.   Design Advisory Committee: The DDB shall appoint a Design Advisory
Committee (DAC) to advise the DDB and the Director on any sign- or other
design-related matters at the request of the DDB or the Director.
   D.   Downtown Sign Compliance Certificate Required: The City shall not issue
a sign permit under this chapter for display within the downtown area unless it
has received a certificate of compliance with the downtown sign design
standards pursuant to this chapter. No such certificate of compliance shall be
issued unless the applicant demonstrates that the proposed sign meets the
requirements of the downtown sign design standards. All sign and face changes
in the downtown area, except changeable copy changes on marquee signs and
handbill display changes, require a new sign permit, including a new
certificate of compliance. Minimum submittal requirements and applications for
compliance certificates are available at the City offices. Fees for compliance
certificates shall be established, and from time to time revised, by resolution
of the DDB.
   E.   Exemptions: Any permit exempt from the permit requirements of this
chapter is also exempt from this section. Any permanent window sign to be
displayed in the downtown area, or any changes to such a window sign requires
DDB approval.
   F.   Certificate Procedure:
      1.   Application Submittal And Review:
         a.   For all signs subject to review under the downtown sign design
standards, an application shall be submitted to the Director at the DDB
offices.
         b.   The Director shall review the application for completeness and
conformity with the downtown sign design standards. The Director may request
individual written comments from DAC members at any time, without convening the
full DAC.
      2.   Director Action: Within seven (7) days of the DDB's receipt of a
complete application, the Director shall take one of the following actions:
         a.   Approve a certificate of compliance for the application, with or
without conditions.
         b.   Deny a certificate of compliance for the application.
         c.   Request an advisory opinion from the DAC. An opinion shall issue
only if it is approved by majority vote, and shall be supported by written
findings. The DAC shall issue its opinion within seven (7) days of the
Director's request, and the Director shall take action within seven (7) days
thereafter. After receiving such an opinion, the Director shall have options
listed in subsections F2a, F2b and F2d of this section.
         d.   Refer the application to the DDB. In this case, the DDB shall
decide, by majority vote, at the next regular monthly DDB meeting, but in no
event more than forty five (45) days after the DDB's receipt of the complete
application, whether the application conforms to the downtown sign design
standards, and accordingly whether to approve, approve with conditions, or deny
a certificate of compliance for the application. A tie vote of the DDB results
in a denial.
      3.   Notice To Applicant: The Director shall send written notice to the
applicant within seven (7) days of any decision to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the certificate, or refer the application to the DDB.
      4.   Appeal: The applicant may appeal to the DDB a Director's decision to
approve with conditions or deny a permit application by letter to the Director
within fourteen (14) days of the Director's decision. In such case, the DDB
shall review the Director's decision de nova under the procedure provided in
subsection F2d of this section. On appeal, the DDB shall decide whether to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the permit. No appeal is permitted
from a DDB decision, except as provided by State law.
      5.   Waiver Of Appeal: The applicant may waive appeal rights in writing
to expedite the City's decision making process on the sign permit.
   G.   Modifications: The applicant may request a modification, a right to
deviate from the downtown sign design standards, in a letter with the
application stating all reasons for the modification. For any application
requesting such a modification, the Director shall first obtain an advisory
opinion from the DAC pursuant to subsection F2c of this section. Otherwise, the
process shall be as stated in subsection F of this section. The Director or DDB
shall approve a certificate of compliance, with or without conditions, for an
application requesting modifications only if each deviation from the downtown
sign design standards meets either the criterion in subsection G1 of this
section or all criteria in subsections G2 through G4 of this section, as
follows:
      1.   Special circumstances exist on the subject property such that the
strict application of the downtown sign design standards would result in undue
practical difficulties for the applicant.
      2.   The modification is consistent with the purposes of the downtown
sign design standards and will not adversely impact surrounding properties.
      3.   The modification represents a creative alternative design in which
sign colors, materials, design, size, height, illumination, and number of signs
are appropriate and compatible with the buildings, structures, and other
features on the site.
      4.   The proposed signs will not negatively affect the visual character
of the area, cause future modification requests, or contribute to degradation
of the visual environment through sign proliferation.

Comprehensive Plan, that has been adopted by the City Council.
CONDEMNATION AND EMINENT DOMAIN: A. Condemnation is the taking of private
property by a government unit for public use when the owner will not relinquish
it through sale or other means. The power to take the property is based on the
concept of eminent domain, which is the legal right of a government to acquire
or "take" private property for public use or public purpose upon paying just
compensation to the owner.
   B.   Condemnation is commonly used to acquire property for highways, street
widening, parks and utility construction. Property has also been condemned
under eminent domain powers for private use in the public interest, such as
urban renewal where the public purpose is the removal of dilapidated
structures.
   C.   The terms "eminent domain" and "condemnation" are often used
interchangeably, although condemnation may also mean the demolition by public
authority of an unsafe structure where no compensation is paid to the owner and
the condemned property does not become public land. (Related terms: Inverse
Condemnation, Taking, Police Power.)
CONDITIONAL USE: A use which, because of special requirements or
characteristics, may be allowed in a particular zoning district only after
review by the planning and zoning commission and granting of conditional use
approval imposing such conditions as necessary to make the use compatible with
other uses permitted in the same zone or vicinity. Conditional uses are issued
for uses of land and, unless otherwise specified or restricted as a condition,
may be transferable from one owner of the land to another.
CONDITIONAL USE CONCEPT PLAN: A concept conditional use is an approval of a
generalized development plan that does not include the details of proposed
development. A detailed conditional use approval must be obtained for each
phase of a concept conditional use.
CONDOMINIUM: Real estate, portions of which are designated for separate
ownership and the remainder of which is designated for common ownership solely
by the owners of those portions. Real estate is not a condominium unless the
undivided interests in the common elements are vested in the unit owners.
COUNCIL: The city council of the city.
COVERED PARKING: A carport that provides full overhead protection from the
elements with ordinary roof coverings. Canvas, lath, fiberglass, plastic and
vegetation are not ordinary roof coverings and cannot be used in providing a
covered parking space.
DAYCARE CENTER: See definitions of Childcare Facility and Adult Day Facility.
DEDICATION: A. The assignment of private property to a specific public use and
its acceptance for such use by the appropriate governmental agency. Dedications
for roads, parks, open space, school sites and other public uses are
increasingly required as a condition for approval of a development. Where costs
are high or a "fee simple" transfer is unnecessary, the owner may, where
authorized, dedicate a portion of the rights through an easement or other form
of less than fee transfer. Such easements may include dedications for scenic,
nonaccess, pedestrian, utility, drainage, floodway, air space and other
purposes.
   B.   Where land dedication is not appropriate, a cash payment (fee in lieu
of) may be authorized. Both are methods to assess the developer with more of
the public costs of the new development. (Related terms: Easement, Conservation
Easement, Open Space, Covenant, Dedication, Development Impact Fees,
Subdivision Regulations.)
DEDICATION (FEE IN LIEU OF): As provided in the definition of "dedication", as
defined in this section, this technique involves cash payments as a substitute
for dedications that are authorized under subdivision regulations when
requirements for mandatory dedication of land are inappropriate. The conditions
under which such payments will be allowed must be spelled out in the
regulations. (Related terms: Dedication, Subdivision Regulations, Development
Impact Fees.)
DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS:
   A.   When a piece of property is purchased, the purchaser also acquires a
number of rights toward the use of that property, such as the right to build a
home, a right to develop commercially, a right to remove gravel or other
materials, a right to use water, a right to raise crops. Which of these rights
are purchased with each property depends on the zoning, other applicable
regulations and the terms of the purchase.
   B.   Acquisition of development rights is a method for controlling urban
growth and conserving natural resources. Essentially, the concept involves
buying the future development potential for land and permits the owner to
continue the existing use, usually agriculture, in urbanizing areas. Hence, a
county or city could acquire a fee or any lesser interest necessary
(development rights) to conserve selected open space, timber or agriculture
lands. A county or city could also acquire fee title to such property and
convey or lease the property back to its original owner using covenants or
contractual agreements to limit the future use of the property. (Related term:
Transferable Development Rights.)

NUISANCE: Anything that interferes with the use or enjoyment of property,
endangers personal health or safety, or is offensive to the senses may be
considered a nuisance. There are many types of nuisances, and the law can be
invoked to determine when, in fact, a nuisance does exist and should be abated.
Nuisance law forms part of the basis for zoning. The separation of uses through
zoning (e.g., industrial from residential areas free from pollution, noise,
congestion and other characteristics of industrial areas) had its origins in
nuisance law.
OCCUPANCY PERMIT: The approval to occupy a building that is granted after
zoning and building requirements and conditions of approval, if any, have been

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT: A parcel of land that is planned and developed as a unit
under single ownership or control, containing one or more uses, buildings and
common open space or recreational facilities.
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD): A. This is a development that is preplanned in
its entirety with the subdivision and zoning controls applied to the project as
a whole rather than to individual lots. Therefore, densities are calculated for
the entire development, usually permitting a tradeoff between clustering of
housing and provision of common open space.
   B.   The PUD is usually characterized by a unified site design and while
most commonly used for residential development, the technique is also
frequently applied to other forms of development such as shopping centers and
industrial parks. Occasionally, a PUD may have a mix of uses.
   C.   The PUD also refers to the process of site plan review, in which public
officials have considerable involvement in determining the nature of the
development. This technique includes aspects of both subdivision and zoning
regulations. A PUD is usually administered through a special permit. (Related
terms: Flexible Zoning, Cluster Development, Mixed Use Zoning, Zero Lot Line.)

Code section 50-1301 et seq., and local ordinances. (Related terms:
Subdivision, Short Plat, Lot Of Record, Site Plan.)
POLICE POWER: The right of government to regulate personal conduct and the use
of land in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, as provided
by the state constitution. The use of police power by a unit of government must
follow "due process" and be "reasonable", but the government does not have to
pay compensation for related losses. In this last respect, it differs from the
government's use of the power of eminent domain that involves taking of
property where just compensation is mandatory. The degree to which such
exercise of police power becomes, in effect, a taking of property, is a
question of longstanding and has arisen again lately in connection with the
growth management and environmental controls being imposed by many communities.
(Related terms: Zoning, Condemnation And Eminent Domain, Taking, Inverse
Condemnation.)

all- terrain vehicles (4 wheels) and any type of three (3) or four (4) wheeled
sport racing/drag vehicle.

SERVICE DRIVE: A privately owned and maintained drive that provides access to
parking lots and spaces, loading spaces, drive-up windows or other areas that
need a provision of access. A service drive meets the zoning ordinance
specifications and is approved by the planning director or the planning and
zoning commission. Types of service drives include: individual private
driveways, common driveways, entry drives, drive-through lanes and parking
aisles.

SITE PLAN REVIEW: The process whereby local officials, usually the planning and
zoning commission and staff, review the site plan of a development to assure
that it meets the stated purposes and standards of the zoning and other
regulations, provides for necessary public facilities, such as roads and
schools, and protects and preserves desirable features and adjacent properties
through the appropriate location of structures and the use of landscaping. Site
plan review is required in connection with many flexible land use regulation
techniques. The process often allows considerable discretion to be exercised by
local officials since it may deal with hard to define aesthetic and design
considerations. (Related terms: Site Plan, Flexible Zoning, Planned Unit
Development.)

   A.   Level Specified: Three (3) levels of zoning review are hereby
established: administrative level, commission level and city council level. All
applications submitted to the building department shall be subject to one or
more of these reviews:
      1.   Administrative Level: There is hereby established a category of uses
that are considered to be allowed uses but for which final approval may be
withheld until certain standards and/or criteria are complied with. The
building director is authorized to review the required approval standards and/
or criteria for this category of allowed uses and issue final approval or
withhold final approval. The actions of the building director on administrative
applications may be appealed to the appropriate authority as hereinafter set

      2.   Commission Level: This level of review requires action by the
planning and zoning commission. An application and fee are required for
commission level review. Commission level decisions may be appealed to the city
council, subject to the procedures set forth in section
11-3-7 of this chapter.
      3.   City Council Level: Certain zoning applications require action by

planning and zoning commission are required for certain city council level
review. Decisions of the city council can be appealed through the judicial
system.
   B.   Resubmittal Of Application: No application for conditional use, rezone,
annexation or variance review that has been denied by the commission or city
council, shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially the same form

03-05)
11-3-6: PUBLIC HEARINGS:
Certain commission and city council level zoning reviews require a public
hearing. The date for such hearing shall be established by the building
director based upon published cutoff and hearing dates for commission level
reviews. The hearing shall be held no later than forty four (44) calendar days
after acceptance of such application and shall include all necessary documents
pertinent thereto. Upon the determination of the building director, when an
application is unusually complex and requires additional review, the date for
the public hearing may be fixed no later than sixty six (66) calendar days
after receipt of such application. Deferrals due to lack of commission quorum
or a request by the applicant shall extend the time during which the hearing
must be held. Council hearing dates shall be established by the city council at
a council meeting after the commission files its recommendation with the city
clerk.
   A.   Notice And Publication Of Hearing; Criteria:
      1.   At least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, notice of the time
and place and a summary of the proposal shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the city. A notice shall also be made available to
other newspapers, radio and television stations servicing the city for use as a
public service announcement. For conditional use applications, rezone
applications and site specific appeals, additional notice shall be provided by
mail to property owners or purchasers of record within the land being
considered; within three hundred feet (300') of the external boundaries of the
land being considered; and any additional area that may be impacted by the
proposed change as determined by the building director. Notice is deemed
sufficient if mailed to the owners of record. Only one notice need be sent to
each household if the owners of record are husband and wife. Notice shall also
be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises not less than one week prior
to the hearing. Failure of the city to provide actual notice to each person so
entitled shall not render any proceeding hereunder invalid; provided, that the
city substantially complies with the notice and hearing requirements of this
chapter.
      2.   The criteria used by the building director for determining if
additional areas may also be impacted by the proposed change shall be as
follows:
         a.   The application could result in significant adverse traffic,
environmental, aesthetic, noise, pollution or population density impacts
occurring outside the minimum three hundred feet (300') notice area.
         b.   The public interest would be better served by expanding the area
to be notified. (2003 Code § 11-03-06)
   B.   Alternate Forms Of Notice: When posted or mailed notice is required to
two hundred (200) or more property owners, purchasers of record or residents,
alternate forms of notice may be provided as follows: In lieu of mailed
notices, three (3) additional newspaper notices as described above and required
notice size as specified in Idaho Code sections 67-6509 and 67-6512(c); and in
lieu of posted notice on each premises, the general area may be posted with
notice. (2003 Code § 11-03-06; amd. 2012 Code)
   C.   Material Changes In Proposal: Following the commission hearing, if the
commission makes a material change in the proposal, further notice and hearing
shall be provided before the commission forwards the proposal with its
recommendation to the city council. For purposes of this subsection, a
"material change" shall mean any modification of the proposal which, in the
opinion of the commission, is of such importance that the public interest will
be better served by additional notice and public hearing. At any public
hearing, the commission may order the hearing to be continued by publicly
announcing the time and place of continuance and no further notice thereof
shall be required. Failure of the city to provide actual notice to each person
so entitled shall not render any proceeding hereunder invalid; provided, that
the city substantially complies with the notice and hearing requirements of
this section.
   D.   Conduct Of Hearings: The city council, the planning and zoning
commission, the hearing examiner, or any other board or commission that
conducts public hearings under this title shall conduct said hearings in
substantial conformity with the following standards. At all such hearings:
      1.   A sign in roster shall be kept at the entrance to the hearing room
for all persons who wish to testify at the hearing on a particular application
or issue. (2003 Code § 11-03-06)
      2.   The chair of the meeting shall conduct the hearing. In order to
accommodate all participants, the chair may determine the time allotted to each
speaker. (2003 Code § 11-03-06; amd. 2012 Code)
      3.   A transcribable record shall be taken and maintained.
      4.   The chair shall call upon the staff to make a preliminary
presentation of facts.
      5.   Following the close of the presentation of facts by staff, the chair
shall invite the applicant (or in the case of an appeal, the appellant) to make
a presentation of evidence to the council, commission or committee. In
situations when the council, commission or committee is acting as an appeals
body and if the appellant is not an applicant for an approval or permit, then
the chair shall call upon the applicant to present evidence to the council,
commission or committee. The applicant or appellant may, in the discretion of
the chair, be allowed up to thirty (30) minutes for the presentation of
evidence unless an extension of time is granted by the council, commission or
committee.
      6.   Every document referred to by any person during testimony (including
charts, maps, photographic evidence or any other evidence) shall be offered
into the record. Every exhibit offered shall be marked and entered into the
record of the proceeding. Such exhibits shall be maintained in the building
department during the appeal period.
      7.   After the staff presentation and testimony by the applicant (or in
the case of an appeal, the appellant) the chair shall open the hearing for
public testimony and shall invite the public to address the council, commission
or committee in the order of names found on the sign in roster. If in the
opinion of the chair the number of persons testifying is so large as to unduly
delay the process of the hearing, the chair may limit public testimony to three
(3) minutes for each member of the public. The public hearing may be continued
upon motion to a date certain that shall be announced to the public there
assembled.
      8.   During appeal hearings before council or the commission, testimony
shall be limited to those issues that were set forth in the written appeal. The
council or commission may ask questions or request information regarding
aspects of the project that were not included in the written appeal if they
desire.
      9.   All persons testifying before the council, commission or committee,
except staff, shall state, for the record, their full name and address.
      10.   Members of the council, commission or committee may question any
person who testified at any time or may, upon unanimous consent of the members
present, recall a person for further testimony.
      11.   Before the close of the public testimony, the chair shall ask if
any persons attending the hearing who did not sign the roster wish to be heard
and any such person shall be given the opportunity to testify.
      12.   At the close of public testimony the chair shall solicit comments
from staff for additional facts or clarifications as a result of the testimony
given. After comments from staff, the applicant shall be given an opportunity
to address final comments to the council, commission or committee. If the
council, commission or committee is hearing an appeal by someone other than the
applicant, the appellant shall be given an opportunity to make final statements
to the council, commission or committee. The chair may determine the time
allowed for final comments subject to the right of the council, commission or
committee to grant such additional time it deems necessary.
      13.   After all testimony, the chair shall declare the public hearing
closed and shall bring the matter back before the council, commission or
committee for discussion and action. The discussion and decision may be
deferred until another date certain that shall be then announced to the public
there assembled.
   E.   Consent Agenda:
      1.   Routine, noncontested applications may be placed on a consent agenda
by the commission in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. Only
applications that meet the following criteria shall be considered for the
consent agenda:
         a.   There has not been any written or verbal opposition to the
application.
         b.   The building staff and the applicant are in agreement on the
findings and conclusions and recommended conditions of approval.
         c.   The application complies with the city comprehensive plan and
this title as proposed, or as it will be modified by conditions of approval.
      2.   Based upon a recommendation from the building staff, the chair of
the commission, at the beginning of the public hearing, shall identify all
items proposed for the consent agenda.
      3.   The chair shall propose the following questions:
         a.   Does the commission have any questions on the application
(provide agenda number and applicant's name)?
         b.   Is there anyone present who has adverse testimony related to the
application (provide agenda number, applicant's name, and location of site)?
         c.   Is the applicant or a representative of the applicant present?
         d.   Is the applicant in agreement with the staff recommendation,
findings and conclusions, and conditions of approval?
      4.   If there is any opposition from any party regarding an application,
that item shall not be placed on the consent agenda. Once the consent agenda is
established, the commission may approve all items on the consent agenda with
one motion.
   F.   Deferral Procedure:
      1.   Applications that have been placed on the planning and zoning
commission public hearing agenda shall only be deferred by the commission. A
request for deferral may be initiated by a member of the commission, the
applicant, the building staff or the public. All deferral requests shall be in
writing. Scheduled agenda items shall only be deferred by the commission within
the public hearing.
      2.   An application shall be considered as on the agenda upon the mailing
of radius notices to impacted property owners and residents. Prior to the
placement of an application on the public hearing agenda, the applicant may
submit a request for rescheduling to the building staff. The building director
shall determine the appropriate hearing date for such requests.
      3.   Requests for deferral that are submitted prior to or at the start of
the public hearing must be ruled upon by the commission after a review of the
situation. The following guidelines should be applied to such requests for
deferral:
         a.   If the applicant and the building staff are in agreement on the
deferral including the requested length of deferral and there is no public
opposition, the commission may consider the request to be routine. Such
requests should be deferred to a date specific when possible to avoid
readvertising.
         b.   Requests for deferral of contested applications must be acted
upon by the commission after consideration of the basis for the request and
input from those present to testify. The chair shall request input from the
applicant, staff and concerned public on the requested deferral. Any member of
the public who cannot or will not return for a deferral hearing shall be
provided an opportunity to testify.
      4.   The commission may deny the request for deferral, grant a deferral
to a date specific or defer the application indefinitely. In considering an
indefinite deferral, the commission should consider the following:
         a.   Have previous deferrals been requested?
         b.   Are additional studies, redesign or other development
alternatives being considered for which the time to complete cannot be
accurately estimated?
         c.   The number of public present to testify and their input on a date
specific deferral.
      5.   The applicant shall pay an additional fee to cover the cost of
readvertising, for applications that are deferred indefinitely by the
commission, unless the commission or staff initiates the request for deferral.
Such fee shall be determined by the building director to cover the actual cost
of readvertising and mailing radius notices. (2003 Code § 11-03-06)
11-3-7: APPEALS:
Any administrative or commission level decision may be appealed to the
appropriate commission, committee or council in accordance with the procedures
established herein. All such appeals must be written, accompanied by the
appropriate fee and submitted to the building director prior to the deadlines
set forth herein. If the appeal deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, the
appeal period is automatically extended to the next workday. Each appeal must
clearly state the name, address and phone number of the person or organization
appealing and the specific issues, items or conditions that are being appealed.
   A.   Administrative Decision Appeals: Any action of the building director on
a specific administrative level application or on the general interpretation of
this title may be appealed as follows:
      1.   Interpretation Of This Title: Decisions of the building director may
be appealed to the planning and zoning commission by any person or by any
official, department, board or bureau of the city aggrieved by such decision.
Such appeals shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of such decision.
Upon receipt of the appeal, the building director shall schedule the appeal
before the commission at the next public hearing following the cutoff date
prior to which the appeal is filed.
      2.   Other Administrative Level Applications: Actions of the building
director on administrative level applications may be appealed to the planning
and zoning commission by the applicant or any aggrieved person within ten (10)
calendar days following the decision. Upon acceptance of the appeal, the
building director shall establish a hearing date before the commission and
shall notify the appealing party, the applicant and all property owners within
three hundred feet (300') of the property. The commission, in reviewing the
building director’s decision, may sustain, deny, amend or modify the decision
by imposing additional or different conditions and limitations.
   B.   Planning And Zoning Commission Appeals:
      1.   Procedure: Any decision of the planning and zoning commission may be
appealed to the city council by the applicant, any aggrieved person or the
building director; provided, that such aggrieved person filed a written or oral
protest with the commission at or before the public hearing, or personally
appeared and voiced a protest at the hearing, except appeals based on lack of
notice. The appealing party shall file a written notice of appeal stating the
grounds for the appeal with the building director before five o’clock (5:00)
P.M. of the tenth calendar day after the decision or determination of the
commission has been made. The building director shall ascertain that the
procedural requirements have been met, notify the city clerk, and forward all
pertinent informational material to the city council for review. An appeal may
not be withdrawn without the approval of the city council. The city council may
sustain, deny, amend or modify the appeal.
      2.   Stay Of Proceedings: The filing of an appeal of a commission level
decision stays further approvals (subdivision, building permit, etc.) on the
project, provided the appeal is received at least twenty four (24) hours prior
to any public hearing regarding the project.
   C.   Hearing Examiner Appeals: The procedure for review of the hearing
examiner’s report is set forth in subsection
11-2-6C of this title.
   D.   Motions to Reconsider: An aggrieved party to any decision of City
Council under this title shall have the right to file a motion to reconsider
within fourteen (14) calendar days of the City Council’s decision. Such
aggrieved party must have appeared and filed a written or oral protest at the
public hearing on the issue. The party seeking reconsideration shall file a
written notice specifically setting forth the objections to the decision, any
factual or legal basis for the reconsideration, and the requested relief. Upon
receipt of the request for reconsideration, and verification of all procedural
requirements being met, the City Clerk shall place the matter on the next
available City Council meeting. A timely motion to reconsider shall be a
mandatory exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to the filing of any
judicial review, declaratory judgment action, or other civil proceeding
challenging the decision at issue. (2003 Code § 11-03-07; amd. Ord. 2221, 3-1-
2022)

   A.   Official Zoning Map:
      1.   The city is hereby divided into zones, or districts, as shown on the
official zoning map that, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this title.
      2.   The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the
mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bearing the seal of the city. If, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and Idaho Code section 67-6501,
the local land use planning act, changes are made in district boundaries or
other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be
entered on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been
approved by the city council, with an entry on the official zoning map as
follows: "On (date), by official action of the city council, the following
(change) changes were made in the official zoning map (brief description of
nature of change);" which entry shall be signed by the zoning administrator or
mayor and attested by the city clerk.
      3.   No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or
matter shown thereon, except in conformity with the procedures set forth in
this chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this chapter.

zoning map that may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning
map that shall be located in the office of the city clerk, shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings
and other structures in the city.
   B.   Replacement Of Official Zoning Map:

changes and additions, the city council may by resolution adopt a new official
zoning map that shall supersede the prior official zoning map.
      2.   The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have
the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent
amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the
signature of the zoning administrator or mayor, attested by the city clerk, and
bearing the seal of the city under the following words:
      "Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been totally
destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be
preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or
amendment."
(Ord. 2208, 7-6-2021)
11-4A-2: RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
official zone map, the following rules shall apply:
   A.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   B.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines. No boundary of a use district can
divide a platted line.

construed as following such city limits.
   D.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks.
   E.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   F.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in subsections A through E of this section shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
   G.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections A through E of this section, the city council shall
interpret the district boundaries. (Ord. 2208, 7-6-2021)
11-4A-3: APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS:
The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, except as hereinafter provided:
   A.   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and
no building, structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   B.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      1.   To exceed the existing height;
      2.   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      3.   To occupy a greater percentage of lot area. A ten percent (10%)
variance of this percentage may be granted by the zoning administrator when
evidence of undue hardship is presented;
      4.   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or
open spaces. Front yard setback may average the setbacks of existing houses on
each side, unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter;
      5.   On property that has not been legally platted.
   C.   No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or
loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose
of complying with this chapter, shall be included as part of a yard, open
space, off-street parking, or loading space similarly required for any other
building.
   D.   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be
reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein.
Yards or lots created after the effective date hereof shall meet at least the
minimum requirements established by this chapter.
   E.   All territory that may hereafter be annexed to the city shall be zoned
by the city council with appropriate recommendations by the planning and zoning
commission at the time of annexation. (Ord. 2208, 7-6-2021)
11-4A-4: SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS:
   A.   Adopted: District regulations shall be set forth in the schedule of
district regulations, hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter, and in section
11-4A-6 of this chapter. Land or premises shall be used, unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, only in conformity with the regulations herein set
forth for the zones or use districts in which such land or premises is located.
No building or structure shall be erected or structurally altered or used,
unless otherwise provided in this chapter, except in conformity with the
regulations herein set forth for the zone or use district in which such
building or structure is located.
   B.   Intent: The following zoning districts are hereby established. For the
interpretation of this chapter, the zoning districts have been formulated to
realize the general purpose as set forth in this chapter and to conform with
the comprehensive plan and its stated goals and objectives. In addition, the
specific purposes of each zoning district shall be as stated. No residence or
commercial building shall be erected or moved onto any lot, tract or parcel of
land in any use district or zone adopted under the provisions of this chapter
unless said lot, tract or parcel of land has been legally platted and a
building permit is issued in accordance with the Building Code.
   C.   Interpretation:
      1.   The interpretation and application of the provisions of this title
shall be by the Zoning Administrator/Building Director. An appeal of an
interpretation of such official shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, who, unless otherwise provided, is authorized to interpret this
title, and such interpretation shall be considered final. Uses are permitted
within the various zones as described in this chapter and as otherwise provided
herein.
      2.   It is recognized that all possible uses and variations of uses that
might arise cannot reasonably be listed or categorized. Mixed uses/sites, or
any use not specifically mentioned or about which there is any question, shall
be administratively classified by comparison with other uses identified in the
zones described in this Code. If the proposed use resembles identified uses in
terms of intensity and character and is consistent with the purposes of this
title and the individual zone classification, it shall be considered as a
permitted/non-permitted use within a general zone classification, subject to
the regulations for the use it most nearly resembles. If a use does not
resemble other identified allowable uses within a zone, it may be permitted as
determined by the hearing body in public hearing as an amendment to this title.
(Ord. 2208, 7-6-2021)
11-4A-5: CITY RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
The official schedule of zone regulations is divided into the following use
groups: Transitional Agricultural, Rural Ranchette, Low Density Residential (1
and 2), Medium Density Residential (1 and 2), and High Density Residential (1
and 2).
   A.   Transitional Agriculture (TAG): The purpose in establishing the
Transitional Agriculture Zone is to set aside land to properly guide growth of
the fringe areas of the community deemed to be important for preservation of
rural standards. Being inside the impact area, it is assumed these areas will
someday be incorporated into the City, therefore they are transitional.
   B.   Rural Ranchette (RR): The purpose of establishing the Rural Ranchette
Zone is to promote and maintain a single-family residential neighborhood that
protects animal rights as part of allowed uses. The purpose is to preserve
areas of land where small acreage including domestic farm animals may be kept
within the City limits and the impact area. The zone also includes residential
uses for handicapped and elderly persons up to eight (8) as referenced by Idaho
Code section 67-6531.
   C.   Low Density Residential 1 (LDR1): The purpose in establishing the LDR1
Zone is to promote and maintain single-family residential neighborhoods, with
conditions favorable to family living, and to encourage the development of low-
density areas of land that are best suited for residential purposes to prevent
overcrowding of the land. The zone shall also include residence for the
handicapped or elderly up to eight (8) persons as referenced by Idaho Code
section 67-6531. The maximum allowed density is six (6) units per acre.
   D.   Low Density Residential 2 (LDR2): The purpose in establishing the LDR2
Zone is to promote and maintain single-family residential neighborhoods, with
conditions favorable to family living, and to encourage the development of low-
density areas of land that are best suited for residential purposes to prevent
overcrowding of the land. An accessory dwelling unit is allowed with a
conditional use permit (CUP). The zone shall also include residence for the
handicap or elderly up to eight (8) persons as referenced by Idaho Code section
67-6531. The maximum allowed density in LDR2 is eight (8) units per acre.
   E.   Medium Density Residential 1 (MDR1): The purpose in establishing the
MDR1 Zone is to provide low to medium density land use for one- and two-family
residential development. The maximum allowed density is fourteen (14) units per
acre.
   F.   Medium Density Residential 2 (MDR2): The purpose in establishing the
MDR2 Zone is to provide low to medium density land use for one- and two-family
residential development. An accessory dwelling unit is allowed with a CUP. The
maximum allowed density is twenty eight (28) units per acre.
   G.   High Density Residential 1 (HDR1): The purpose in establishing the
Multi-Family Residence Zone is to provide for medium density land use and to
encourage more compact residential development. The maximum allowed density is
thirty (30) units per acre.
   H.   High Density Residential 2 (HDR2): The purpose in establishing the
Larger Multi-Family Residence Zone is to provide areas of land for high density
residential development, also in which small professional offices and certain
other type of semi-commercial uses may be located. The maximum allowed density
is dependent on an approvable development plan and is not measured in units per
acre. (Ord. 2208, 7-6-2021)

         c.   Wind Energy Conversion Systems:
            (1)   Purpose And Intent: To balance the need for clean, renewable
energy resources and the necessity to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of the community, the city finds these regulations are necessary to
ensure that wind energy conversion systems are appropriately designed and
safely sited and installed. This section establishes the regulations and
criteria which allow compatible accessory uses to be located within the various
land use districts. Unless otherwise provided, all accessory uses are subject
to the same regulations as the sponsoring primary use.
            (2)   Definitions:
               (A)   RESIDENTIAL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM: A wind energy conversion
system consisting of a wind turbine, tower and associated control or conversion
electronics, which is intended to primarily reduce on site consumption of
utility power. A system is considered a residential wind energy system only if
it supplies electrical power solely for on-site use, except that when a parcel
on which the system is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a
utility company, excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for
on-site use may be used by the utility company.
               (B)   TOWER: The vertical component of a wind energy conversion
system that elevates the wind turbine generator and attached blades above the
ground.
            (3)   Regulations: Residential wind energy systems shall be a
permitted use in all zoning classifications where structures of any sort are
allowed, subject to certain requirements as set forth below:
               (A)   Tower Height: For property sizes less than one acre, the
tower height shall be limited to sixty feet (60'). For property sizes of one
acre or more, there is no limitation on tower height, except as imposed by FAA
regulations.
               (B)   Clearance Of Blade: No portion of the residential wind
energy system shall extend within twenty feet (20') of the ground.
               (C)   Setback: No part of the wind system structure, including
guywire anchors, may extend closer than ten feet (10') to the property
boundaries of the installation site; provided, that it also complies with any
applicable fire setback requirements.
               (D)   Automatic Over Speed Controls: All wind energy conversion
systems shall be equipped with manual (electronic or mechanical) and automatic
over speed controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the design
limits of the residential wind energy system.
               (E)   Sound: Residential wind energy systems shall not exceed
sixty (60) dBA, as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. The
level, however, may be exceeded during short term events, such as utility
outages and/or severe windstorms.
               (F)   Approved Wind Turbines: Residential wind turbines must be
approved under an emerging technology program, such as the California Energy
Commission, IEC or any other small wind certification program recognized by the
American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) or the U.S. Department of Energy.
Noncertified residential wind turbines must submit a description of the safety
features of the turbine prepared by a registered mechanical engineer.
               (G)   Compliance With International Building Code: Building
permit applications for residential wind systems shall be accompanied by
standard drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the tower, base, and
footings. An engineering analysis of the tower showing compliance with the
International Building Code and certified by a licensed professional engineer
shall also be submitted. This analysis may be supplied by the manufacturer. Wet
stamps shall not be required.
               (H)   Compliance With FAA Regulations: Residential wind energy
systems must comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary
approvals for installations close to airports.
               (I)   Compliance With National Electric Code: Building permit
applications for residential wind energy systems shall be accompanied by a line
drawing of the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a
determination that the manner of the installation conforms to the National
Electrical Code. This information may be supplied by the manufacturer.
               (J)   Utility Notification: No residential wind energy system
shall be installed until evidence has been given that the utility company has
been informed of the customer’s intent to install an interconnected customer
owned generator. Off grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
               (K)   Minimum Lot Size: The minimum lot size for a tower shall
be forty thousand (40,000) square feet.
               (L)   Placement On Lot: The tower must be placed in the lot so
that in the event the tower falls in any direction, it cannot encroach on
adjoining property.
      19.   Animal Rights: The following provisions shall apply to the TAG and
RR zones in the impact area upon annexation into the city:
         a.   Description Of Land And Livestock: Any landowner having livestock
upon lands located within the area of city impact may provide to the City
Planning and Zoning Commission a description of the land together with a
description of the livestock on said lands, which shall include the number of
livestock as well as the type of livestock located on said lands.
         b.   Historic Herd Size: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
review the descriptions as submitted by a landowner, and together with the
landowner determine a historic herd size for the parcel of land described. The
record of historic herd size shall be kept by the City Clerk and shall be
preserved for the purpose of determining existing land use on said lands as of
the date of annexation.
         c.   Discontinued Use: In the event a landowner shall discontinue the
use and maintenance of livestock on lands described and provided to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for a period of five (5) consecutive years, when
such use shall not be reestablished, the uses of the premises thereafter shall
be in conformity with the regulations of the zone district in which the land is
situated; provided, that the use and maintenance of a lesser number of the same
general type of livestock on the described lands shall be deemed to conform to
the historic herd size as recorded with the City Clerk and will allow the
continued recognition of the historic herd size as the current existing land
use.
         d.   Expansion Or Enlargement Of Herd: The expansion or enlargement of
a livestock herd shall be allowed only by the granting of a conditional use
permit, zone change or variance, as provided by this title and depending upon
the particular circumstances and facts involved.
      20.   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU):
         a.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to allow a more economic
and efficient use of the City’s housing supply, land, and infrastructure;
provide a mix of housing that responds to changing family needs; provide a
means for homeowners, particularly seniors, single parents, and families with
grown children, to remain in their homes and neighborhoods, and obtain extra
income, security, companionship and services; protect neighborhood stability
and property values; and maintain the appearance and character of Blackfoot’s
single household neighborhoods.
         b.   Ownership: If the proposed accessory dwelling is located in a
TAG, RR, or LDR-2 zone:
            (1)   The owner of the property on which the accessory dwelling is
to be created shall occupy one or the other of the dwelling units. For the
purposes of this section:
               (A)   Owner shall mean one or more individuals who hold title
directly or indirectly to the dwelling, and for whom the dwelling is the
primary residence; a natural or adopted parent, grandparent, child, grandchild,
brother, or sister of the owner of the dwelling may be considered the owner
occupying one or the other of the dwelling units.
               (B)   Owner occupancy shall mean a property owner who makes his
or her legal residence at the site, as evidenced by voter registration, vehicle
registration, or similar means, and resides at the site more than six (6)
months in any given year.
            (2)   Before obtaining a building permit, a deed restriction shall
be recorded requiring that either the primary unit or the accessory unit be
owner occupied and that the accessory dwelling shall not be sold separately.
The deed restriction shall run with the land but may be lifted at a future time
if the main dwelling and the accessory are converted back into a single
residence, or the property conforms to current zoning standards.
         c.   Location:
            (1)   An accessory dwelling unit is located on the same lot as a
single household dwelling unit, either within the same building as the single
household dwelling or in a detached building such as a guest house or attached
to a garage. It shall not be attached to a duplex or other multi-family
structure.
            (2)   An accessory dwelling unit may also be attached to or part of
a non-residential structure or land use, such as a caretaker unit, parsonage,
live-work unit, or loft apartment. Multiple apartments above or behind
commercial space in mixed-use buildings are not considered accessory dwellings.
            (3)   Accessory dwelling units are permitted with restrictions
throughout the City in the following Single Family Zones TAG, RR, and LDR-2.
New subdivisions in LDR-1 Zones may also be allowed accessory dwelling units if
requested at the time of plat development and approval. ADU’s will not be
allowed in existing LDR-1 subdivisions without an approved rezone.
         d.   Size And Height:
            (1)   Accessory units associated with a single household dwelling
shall be smaller than and clearly subordinate to the primary dwelling unit, and
no larger than one thousand square feet (1,000 ft2) in size. If the accessory
dwelling will occupy one level of the home (e.g., basement), it is not feasible
to use the remaining area on that level as part of the primary dwelling, and it
meets all other requirements of this chapter, it may be authorized by the
Director or his designee to occupy the entire level, regardless of size.
            (2)   An accessory dwelling unit associated with a non-residential
structure or land use shall not be limited in size but must be smaller than and
subordinate to the primary land use.
            (3)   The height of the accessory unit shall not exceed the height
of the main structure on site, or as permitted by the underlying zoning

ensure that wind energy conversion systems are appropriately designed and
safely sited and installed. This section establishes the regulations and
criteria which allow compatible accessory uses to be located within the various
land use districts. Unless otherwise provided, all accessory uses are subject
to the same regulations as the sponsoring primary use.
            (2)   Definitions:
               (A)   RESIDENTIAL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM: A wind energy conversion
system consisting of a wind turbine, tower and associated control or conversion
electronics, which is intended to primarily reduce on site consumption of
utility power. A system is considered a residential wind energy system only if
it supplies electrical power solely for on-site use, except that when a parcel
on which the system is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a
utility company, excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for
on-site use may be used by the utility company.
               (B)   TOWER: The vertical component of a wind energy conversion
system that elevates the wind turbine generator and attached blades above the
ground.
            (3)   Regulations: Residential wind energy systems shall be a
permitted use in all zoning classifications where structures of any sort are
allowed, subject to certain requirements as set forth below:
               (A)   Tower Height: For property sizes less than one acre, the
tower height shall be limited to sixty feet (60'). For property sizes of one
acre or more, there is no limitation on tower height, except as imposed by FAA
regulations.
               (B)   Clearance Of Blade: No portion of the residential wind
energy system shall extend within twenty feet (20') of the ground.
               (C)   Setback: No part of the wind system structure, including
guywire anchors, may extend closer than ten feet (10') to the property
boundaries of the installation site; provided, that it also complies with any
applicable fire setback requirements.
               (D)   Automatic Over Speed Controls: All wind energy conversion
systems shall be equipped with manual (electronic or mechanical) and automatic
over speed controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the design
limits of the residential wind energy system.
               (E)   Sound: Residential wind energy systems shall not exceed
sixty (60) dBA, as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. The
level, however, may be exceeded during short term events, such as utility
outages and/or severe windstorms.

      c.   Wind Energy Conversion Systems:
         (1)   Purpose And Intent: To balance the need for clean, renewable
energy resources and the necessity to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of the community, the city finds these regulations are necessary to
ensure that wind energy conversion systems are appropriately designed and
safely sited and installed. This section establishes the regulations and
criteria which allow compatible accessory uses to be located within the various
land use districts. Unless otherwise provided, all accessory uses are subject
to the same regulations as the sponsoring primary use.
         (2)   Definitions:
            (A)   RESIDENTIAL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM: A wind energy conversion
system consisting of a wind turbine, tower and associated control or conversion
electronics, which is intended to primarily reduce on site consumption of
utility power. A system is considered a residential wind energy system only if
it supplies electrical power solely for on-site use, except that when a parcel
on which the system is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a
utility company, excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for
on-site use may be used by the utility company.
            (B)   TOWER: The vertical component of a wind energy conversion
system that elevates the wind turbine generator and attached blades above the
ground.
         (3)   Regulations: Residential wind energy systems shall be a
permitted use in all zoning classifications where structures of any sort are
allowed, subject to certain requirements as set forth below:
            (A)   Tower Height: For property sizes less than one acre, the
tower height shall be limited to sixty feet (60'). For property sizes of one
acre or more, there is no limitation on tower height, except as imposed by FAA
regulations.
            (B)   Clearance Of Blade: No portion of the residential wind energy
system shall extend within twenty feet (20') of the ground.
            (C)   Setback: No part of the wind system structure, including
guywire anchors, may extend closer than ten feet (10') to the property
boundaries of the installation site; provided, that it also complies with any
applicable fire setback requirements.
            (D)   Automatic Over Speed Controls: All wind energy conversion
systems shall be equipped with manual (electronic or mechanical) and automatic
over speed controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the design
limits of the residential wind energy system.
            (E)   Sound: Residential wind energy systems shall not exceed sixty
(60) dBA, as measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. The level,
however, may be exceeded during short term events, such as utility outages and/
or severe windstorms.
            (F)   Approved Wind Turbines: Residential wind turbines must be
approved under an emerging technology program, such as the California Energy
Commission, IEC or any other small wind certification program recognized by the
American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) or the U.S. Department of Energy.
Noncertified residential wind turbines must submit a description of the safety
features of the turbine prepared by a registered mechanical engineer.
            (G)   Compliance With International Building Code: Building permit
applications for residential wind systems shall be accompanied by standard
drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the tower, base, and
footings. An engineering analysis of the tower showing compliance with the
International Building Code and certified by a licensed professional engineer
shall also be submitted. This analysis may be supplied by the manufacturer. Wet
stamps shall not be required.
            (H)   Compliance With FAA Regulations: Residential wind energy
systems must comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary
approvals for installations close to airports.
            (I)   Compliance With National Electric Code: Building permit
applications for residential wind energy systems shall be accompanied by a line
drawing of the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a
determination that the manner of the installation conforms to the National
Electrical Code. This information may be supplied by the manufacturer.
            (J)   Utility Notification: No residential wind energy system shall
be installed until evidence has been given that the utility company has been
informed of the customer’s intent to install an interconnected customer owned
generator. Off grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
            (K)   Minimum Lot Size: The minimum lot size for a tower shall be
forty thousand (40,000) square feet.
            (L)   Placement On Lot: The tower must be placed in the lot so that
in the event the tower falls in any direction, it cannot encroach on adjoining
property.
   19.   Animal Rights: The keeping of farm animals is not allowed except
domestic hen chickens (see 19a). Dogs and cats are allowed as per city code
section
6-2-6. Exotic animals such as goats, potbellied pigs, etc. may be allowed with
the issuance of a conditional use permit.
      a.   Exception: Notwithstanding any restrictions contained in this code
to the contrary, the keeping of not more than six (6) domestic hen chickens is
permitted within the rear yard of any single-family dwelling or duplex,
provided that the following requirements are observed:
         (1)   Eggs produced by such hens shall not be sold for pecuniary gain
or profit.
         (2)   Such hens shall not be slaughtered on the premises or raised or
sold for slaughter or for pecuniary gain or profit.
         (3)   The hens must be contained in the rear yard by suitable fence,
chicken coop, or both. The fence and/or chicken coop must be constructed and
maintained in such a manner that they prevent the chickens from leaving the
rear yard. The fence and/or chicken coop must be set back at least five feet
(5') from the property line on all sides. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
fence may be placed on the property line adjacent to an alleyway at the rear of
the property.
         (4)   The chickens must be maintained in such a manner that they do
not become a “nuisance” as that term is defined in this code.
         (5)   For the purposes of this subsection, the term “rear yard” means
a residential yard lying between the rear lot line and the nearest foundation
line of the main building and extending across the full width of the lot. In
the case of a corner lot where the building fronts on a side street, the rear
yard may be established from the rear of the house to the side property line.

approved by the city council.
   C.   Review And Approvals:
      1.   The planning commission shall review the plan to determine its
compliance with any portion of the city land use plan and this title. In
considering approval of the development, the planning and zoning commission
shall, among other things, make sure that such development will mesh
harmoniously with the surrounding area; that it will not produce a volume of
traffic beyond the capacity of the surrounding street system. Requirements for
utilities, off street parking, traffic circulation and other public
requirements will be adequately met and the standards and intent of this
section shall be adequately complied with.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission may require changes to be made in
the plan. They may also require additional yards or buffers or other
improvements to be installed along with greater amounts of landscaping or
parking spaces. Said changes may be imposed as conditions of approval where it
is determined by the planning and zoning commission that such changes are
necessary to ensure that the development will mesh harmoniously with adjoining
or nearby uses.
      3.   An application for approval of a travel trailer park shall be
granted or denied only after a public hearing by the planning and zoning
commission. Notice of the hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general
circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to said hearing.
      4.   After consideration of the planning and zoning commission, the
application, with the planning and zoning commission's recommendations, shall
be submitted to the city council for its approval. An application denied by the
planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the city council. Said appeal
must be made in writing within ten (10) days after the denial is made by the
planning and zoning commission. Approval of the preliminary plan shall be valid
for a period of one year. (2003 Code § 11-05-11; amd. Ord. 2270, 6-3-2025)

of either the entire travel trailer park or the first stage of such development
that is to be constructed. Such plan shall be drawn to scale and provide in
detail the information required under this chapter.
   B.   Copies of the final approved documents shall also be filed in the
office of the zoning administrator. No building permit shall be issued for said
travel trailer park until final plans have been approved by the planning and
zoning commission and the city council, and the required documents filed in the
office of the zoning administrator, and until the guarantee of performance
required stated in section
11-5-4-5 of this chapter has been properly posted. (2003 Code § 11-05-12)
11-5-4-4: STAGE CONSTRUCTION PERMITTED:
Development may be carried out in progressive stages, in which event, each
stage shall be so planned that the requirements and intent of this chapter
shall be fully complied with at the completion of each stage. No final plan for
the initial stage shall cover less than one acre. (2003 Code § 11-05-13)
11-5-4-5: GUARANTEE OF PERFORMANCE:
   A.   Ability To Perform: Prior to issuing a building permit for the
construction of a travel trailer park, the developer must submit evidence
satisfactory to the city council that the developer has the means and the
ability to complete the stage of construction for which he has applied for a
building permit. Such evidence shall consist of the contractor's bid or the
engineer's or architect's estimate of the amount required to complete the
development, together with the resources of the developer committed to such
expenditure, or the proof of the loan commitment sufficient to construct and
complete such development.
   B.   Possession And Occupancy: No possession or occupancy of the travel
trailer park shall be allowed until the improvements as planned shall be fully
constructed; provided, however, that if the developer desires to have any
occupancy of a portion of the partially developed staged construction, the
developer shall post bond as security for the completion of all improvements.
Included in these improvements, but not limited to, landscaping, road
improvements, pedestrianways, curbs, gutters, road surfacing, water, sanitary
and storm drain lines and common facilities as shown in the final site plan.
Upon the posting of bond, satisfactory in form and amount, to the city council
for the completion of such improvements, occupancy may be granted upon a
partially constructed and developed travel trailer park.
   C.   Estimates: All cost estimates for completing the development shall be
submitted to the city engineer for his approval.
   D.   Duration Of Bond: The duration of any bonds or other assurance of
completion of improvements and development of travel trailer parks shall be for
a minimum of two (2) years from the date of the approval of the development by
the city council. An extension of time may be granted by the city council upon
application of the developer, provided such application is submitted at least
sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the bond and provided the issuer of
the bond is willing to extend the time of assurance.
   E.   Default: In the event the developer defaults or fails or neglects to
satisfactorily install the required improvements within the time limitation,
the city council may declare the bond or other assurance forfeited and the city
may install, or cause to be installed, the required improvements using the
proceeds from the bonds or other assurance to defray the expense thereof.
   F.   Release Of Security: The developer shall be responsible for the quality
of all materials and workmanship. All street and utility work shall be
inspected by the city and upon the completion of installation of all such
improvements, the city engineer shall make a final inspection of the
improvements and shall submit a report to the city council. If the improvements
do not meet the standards and the plans, the engineer shall so report and the
developer shall be obliged to correct the improvements and complete the
installation to meet all such plans and the approval of the city engineer. Upon
the city engineer's approval of the installation of improvements, the bond or
other assurance shall be released and exonerated.
   G.   Continuing Obligation:
      1.   Any failure on the part of the developer or his assigns to maintain
the travel trailer park in accordance with the approved management policies,
covenants, conditions and restrictions and agreements shall be deemed a public
nuisance endangering the health, safety and general welfare of the public and a
detriment to the surrounding area.
      2.   All maintenance of private drives, including, but not limited to,
utilities, drainage, streets and snow removal, shall be the responsibility of
the owner.
   H.   Abatement, Removal: In addition to any other remedy provided by law for
the abatement or removal of such public nuisance, the city may remove or abate
the nuisance and charge the cost thereof, including reasonable attorney fees,
to the owner. (2003 Code § 11-05-14)

11-6A-4: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS:
   A.   Justification: Conditional uses by definition possess characteristics
such as to require review and appraisal by the planning and zoning commission
to determine whether or not the use would cause any damage, hazard, nuisance or
other detriment to persons or property in the vicinity.
   B.   Be Listed As A Conditional Use: Constitute a conditional use as
established in the land use tables of this chapter.
   C.   Application, Fee Required: Every person seeking conditional use

neighborhood, the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan,
and the effects of the following on the adjoining property: noise, glare,
traffic generated, vibration, odor, fumes, drainage, building height, massing,
and solid waste.
   D.   Notice Of Hearing; Publication: The planning and zoning commission
shall hold a public hearing and give notice of hearing for every application
for a conditional use as required by section
11-3-6 of this title.
   E.   Commission Action: Following the hearing, the planning and zoning
commission shall approve, deny or modify the application for a conditional use
permit, imposing any conditions needed to establish the findings of subsection
K of this section.
   F.   Effective Date Of Approval: Approval of any conditional use permit by
the planning and zoning commission shall become final after a lapse of ten (10)
calendar days from the date following the decision; provided, however, that
such effective date shall be stayed by the filing of an appeal as provided in
subsection
11-3-7B of this title.
   G.   Resubmittal Of Denied Application: No application for conditional use
permit that has been denied by the planning and zoning commission or the city
council, shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially the same form
in less than one year from the date of final action thereon.
   H.   Term Of Permits: The term of a permit shall continue indefinitely
unless the approved conditional use changes to a new use or the operation of
the approved conditional use increases by more than twenty-five percent (25%)
or the operation of the approved conditional use changes sufficiently to
violate the criteria and findings set forth in subsection N herein. If the
approved conditional use requires modification of a structure, the holder of
the permit must, within six (6) months:
      1.   Acquire construction permits and commence placement of permanent
footings and structures on or in the ground. The definition of structures in
this context shall include sewer lines, water lines, streets or building
foundations; or
      2.   Commence the use permitted by the permits in accordance with the
conditions of approval; or
      3.   For conceptual conditional use permits, submit an application for
detailed conditional use permit; or

within which the permit shall be completed, perfected or bonded. If the
conditions of approval shall not be completed or bonded within such period,
said permit shall lapse.
   I.   Extensions:
      1.   If the use or operation of a conditional use permit changes or the
approved operation increases, the planning and zoning commission may, upon
written request by the holder, grant a one (1) year time extension to a
conditional use permit and allow time for modification and/or submission of an
application for a new conditional use permit. Upon receipt of written request
for extension, the zoning administrator/building director shall determine if a
hearing on the request is required, based on the following considerations:
         a.   Whether there have been significant amendments to the
comprehensive plan or this title that will apply to the subject conditional use
permit; or
         b.   If significant land use changes have occurred in the project
vicinity that would adversely impact the project or be adversely impacted by
the project; or
         c.   Whether hazardous situations have developed or have been
discovered in the project area; or
         d.   If community facilities and services required for the project
remain adequate.
      2.   If any of the foregoing considerations are found to exist with
regard to the project for which an extension is sought, a hearing shall be
required. If a hearing is required, notice shall be provided as described in
section
11-3-6 of this title and a new application and fee must be submitted in
compliance with current plans and ordinances and in accordance with the
application procedures of this section.
   J.   Modification And Revocation: Upon application by the holder of a
conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission may modify the
conditions and limitations of the permit in accordance with the limitations and
requirements of subsection M of this section. The planning and zoning
commission may delegate to the zoning administrator/building director authority
to consider minor modifications to conditional use permits. The zoning
administrator/building director may refer any modification request to the
planning and zoning commission if in his/her judgment, the change is
significant or could best be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission.
The commission may revoke or modify a conditional use permit, upon notice and
hearing, for breach or violation of any condition or limitation of said permit.
   K.   Staff Level Modifications: Staff level modifications of conditional use
approvals shall include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:
      1.   A reduction in density that does not exceed twenty five percent
(25%) of the total units.

reason, such as road alignment, topography, access or solar access or stability
in hillside areas.
      3.   A change in the phasing plan.
      4.   A modification to the recreation area or open space design, but not
elimination or significant reduction.
      5.   An increase or decrease in proposed setback as long as ordinance
requirements are met.
      6.   A change in building elevations as reviewed and approved by the
staff.
   L.   Conditional Use Modification; Considerations, Conditions:
      1.   Prior to approving any conditional use modification, the zoning
administrator/building director shall determine that the following are true:
         a.   The requested modification was not the subject of an appeal
during the public hearing process; or
         b.   The requested modification will not adversely impact adjacent
properties.
      2.   All staff level conditional use modification approvals shall be in
writing and shall be signed by the zoning administrator/building director, or
deputy director. A letter stating the nature of the modification and findings
of fact on which the approval was based shall be provided by mail to the
applicant. A notice, stating the nature of the modification, shall be provided
by mail to the property owners, purchasers of record and residents within a
three hundred foot (300') radius of the external boundaries of the subject
property. A copy of that notice and documentation of its mailing shall be noted
and entered into the project files.
   M.   Modifications Requiring Commission Approval: Commission level approval
of conditional use modifications shall be required for the changes described
below:
      1.   Any increase in population density.
      2.   Density increases exceeding twenty five percent (25%) of the total

      8.   A request to change or delete a condition of approval.
   N.   Criteria And Findings: The planning and zoning commission, following
the procedures outlined below, may approve a conditional use permit when the
evidence presented at the hearing is such as to establish:
      1.   Location: The location of the proposed use is compatible to other
uses in the general neighborhood and will not place an undue burden on existing
transportation and service facilities in the vicinity; and
      2.   Size Of Property: The site is large enough to accommodate the
proposed use and all yards, open spaces, pathways, walls and fences, parking,
loading, landscaping and such other features as are required by this title; and
      3.   Compatibility: The proposed use, if it complies with all conditions
imposed, will not adversely affect other property of the vicinity; and
      4.   Nuisance: Not create a nuisance or safety hazard for neighboring
properties in terms of excessive noise or vibration, improperly directed glare
or heat, electrical interface, odors, dust or air pollutants, solid waste
generation and storage, hazardous materials or waste, excessive traffic
generation, or interference with pedestrian traffic and that the proposed use
will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare; and
      5.   Compliance Plan: The proposed use is in compliance with and supports
the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan; and
      6.   Public Facilities And Services: The request can demonstrate adequate
public facilities, including roads, schools, street access, drainage, drainage
structures, potable water, sanitary sewer, refuse disposal, and police and fire
protection, exist or will exist to serve the requested use at the time such
facilities are needed. If existing facilities are not adequate, the developer
shall show that such facilities shall be upgraded sufficiently to serve the
proposed use; and
      7.   Traffic: Not generate traffic in excess of the capacity of public
streets or access points serving the proposed use and will assure adequate

(2003 Code § 11-06-04; amd. Ord. 2192, 5-5-2020)
11-6A-5: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Justification:
      1.   A planned development is a parcel of land that is planned and
developed as a unit under single ownership or control, containing one or more
uses, buildings and common open space or recreational facilities.
      2.   The planned development process provides an opportunity for land
development that preserves natural features, allows efficient provision of
services, and provides common open spaces or other amenities not found in
traditional lot by lot development. The process also provides for the
consistent application of conditions of approval for the various phases of a
planned development. Every planned development requires a conditional use
application, and shall be subject to all conditional use procedures.
   B.   Use Exceptions:
      1.   In the case of planned developments greater than five (5) acres in
size in residential, commercial or industrial districts, the planning and
zoning commission may authorize specified uses not permitted by the use
regulations of the district in which the development is located. The purpose of
this provision is to avoid single use projects that generate high levels of
traffic and to promote other uses that are functionally integrated with and
provide services to the primary use;
      2.   Approval shall be based on the following findings:
         a.   The uses permitted by such exception are strongly related to the
primary use and are intended and designed to provide services or facilities
useful and convenient to the primary use.
         b.   The uses permitted by such exception are integrated into the
larger project through the following features:
            (1)   The use exception site shall be located in proximity to and
therefore within reasonable walking distance of all portions of the primary
use.
            (2)   One or more of the main vehicular accesses to the primary
site shall also serve as the main access for the use exception site.
            (3)   Pedestrian and/or bicycle pathway connections shall be
provided from the primary use.
            (4)   Buildings on the use exception site shall be oriented to
facilitate access from the primary use.
            (5)   Architecture and building bulk shall reflect or complement
the primary use.
            (6)   Landscaping concepts from the primary use shall be continued
onto the use of the exception site.
            (7)   Signage shall be low profile and consistent with any sign
package submitted for the primary use;
      3.   The uses permitted by the exception are neighborhood or community
serving in nature and in scale and do not constitute a regional serving use;
      4.   The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so
located as to be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood;
      5.   No more than twenty percent (20%) of the total area of the planned
development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the exception; and
      6.   The development is phased so that the construction of the excepted
use or uses will be justified by the construction of all or a proportionate
phase of the permitted use.
   C.   Development Standards: The planning and zoning commission may approve
planned unit developments in accordance with the following standards:
      1.   Changes May Be Approved: Changes from the development standards of
the underlying zone may be approved.
      2.   Planned Development Size: The minimum size for a planned development
shall be as follows:
         a.   Planned residential development: No minimum.
         b.   Planned commercial development: One acre.
         c.   Planned industrial development: Five (5) acres.
         d.   Planned office development: Two (2) acres.
      3.   Residential Density: The number of dwelling units allowed in a
planned development shall be calculated by dividing the gross area, less the
area set aside for nonresidential uses (that is, office, commercial or
industrial), by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the zone in
which the site is located.
      4.   Private Open Space: All residential planned developments on less
than one acre shall provide each dwelling unit with a minimum of one hundred
(100) square feet of usable private open space. The planning and zoning
commission should evaluate each project on its own merits and allow variations
to the open space standard where it can be shown that the provided space meets
the intent and purpose of this title.
      5.   Required Setbacks:
         a.   Attached structures may be permitted in planned developments. The
minimum separation between detached buildings shall be ten feet (10') unless
greater separation is required by fire or building codes.
         b.   Along the periphery of planned developments, yards shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which the
development is located, unless the planning and zoning commission provides an
exception as provided for in this subsection. Where development already exists
at the periphery, the yards shall, where practical, be matched. For example,
side yards should be provided adjacent to side yards, rear yards adjacent to
rear yards and front yards opposite front yards.
      6.   Service Drives; Private Streets: Service drive design and
construction shall comply with the requirements of this title. Private street
design and construction shall comply with the requirements of the subdivision
ordinance.
      7.   Residential Infill Planned Developments: Lots within the city that
are located within areas already largely developed (at least 80 percent of the
land within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the subject lot) and to
which municipal fire, police, sewer, water and school services are already
available may qualify for infill development. In reviewing infill planned
development, the planning and zoning commission may allow exceptions to
subsections C1 through C6 of this section as follows:
         a.   The planning and zoning commission may allow up to a twenty
percent (20%) increase in the density allowed in the zoning district as an
infill incentive.
         b.   The applicant shall submit documentation that the site qualifies
as an infill site with the conditional use application. Verification of infill
may be in the form of recent aerial photographs. In addition, the developer
shall provide documentation regarding the availability of the following
services: 1) water; 2) sewer; 3) fire coverage; and 4) public schools.
      8.   Residential Uses: A variety of housing types or residential uses may
be included in planned developments, including attached units (duplexes,
townhomes), detached units (patio homes), single-family units and multiple-
family units (triplexes, 4-plexes, 6-plexes, etc.) regardless of the zoning
classification of the district; provided, that the overall density of the zone
is maintained. This applies only to planned residential developments.
   D.   Application Procedure:
      1.   Stages Of Submittal: A conditional use application for a planned
development may be submitted in one or two (2) stages:
         a.   As a detailed conditional use application; or
         b.   Any planning and zoning commission level conditional use
application may be submitted and processed as a concept plan. The applicant
must specify on the application form that concept approval is being requested.
A concept approval is a statement by the city that a general development plan,
including the general arrangement of uses, density, location of major streets,
open spaces, utilities, etc., is acceptable. A concept review allows the
applicant to obtain approval of a general development plan without incurring
the expense of preparing detailed building plans until after the concept
approval. It provides the developer and the city with guidelines for the design
of each phase of a project. Supporting information will be required for concept
applications as specified by the zoning administrator/building director.
      2.   Phases Require Approval: Each phase of a concept approval requires
detailed conditional use approval through a new application, fee and public
hearing. Submittal requirements for detailed conditional use applications are
the same as for standard conditional use applications that are processed and
reviewed in one step.
      3.   Public Hearing: The concept and detailed conditional use
applications are both subject to the public hearing requirements of section
11-3-6 of this title and the conditional use requirements of this section and
section
11-6A-4 of this article.
      4.   Concurrent Review Of Other Applications May Be Required: In cases
where subdivision platting is being proposed or would be required, concurrent
review of the conditional use and subdivision plat is required when the zoning
administrator/building director determines that regulations of the subdivision
ordinance, including, but not limited to, private streets, apply to the design
of the proposed development.
   E.   Staff Review Procedure; Extended Period: The zoning administrator/
building director may extend the review/processing period for large planned
development applications to a maximum of sixty six (66) days from the cutoff
date prior to which the application was submitted. This extended review period
is to allow for adequate staff research and analysis, agency review and
comment, coordination with other city departments, and coordination with the
applicant. Planned development applications for which additional review time is
required shall be subject to the following procedures:
      1.   A summary of the development proposal shall be presented to the city
council as an information item during a scheduled precouncil meeting prior to
the submittal of the staff report to the planning and zoning commission.
      2.   Recommended conditions of approval submitted to the planning and
zoning commission and made available to the public shall not be altered by
staff or any other party prior to the public hearing. The planning and zoning
commission may alter or modify conditions of approval.
      3.   When the Planning and Zoning Commission has completed its action on
a proposed planned unit development (PUD), the planning and zoning
administrator will forward the PUD to the Mayor, recommending that it be
submitted to the city council for approval or denial. The city clerk shall
place the request for the PUD on the next available city council agenda.
   F.   Developer Benefits: Planned developments are intended to provide
certain benefits to the public and to the developer. The installation of public
improvements (streets, water, sewer, streetlights, etc.) ensure a public
benefit. To provide the developer with an incentive to utilize the planned
development process, the following allowances may be incorporated into a
planned development proposal:
      1.   A variety of housing types may be included in the project, including
attached units, detached units, single-family units and multiple-family units.
      2.   The minimum lot size of the zoning district may be reduced within
the density limits of the district.
      3.   Planned developments may use private streets and service drives that
are designed and constructed to the standards of the zoning and subdivision
ordinances.
      4.   Setbacks for buildings within the interior of the project may be
less than required in the zoning district.
      5.   The conditions of approval applied to a large planned development
concept plan shall be applied consistently to each subsequent phase, unless
otherwise agreed to by both the applicant and the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
      6.   Uses that are not allowed within the zoning district may be allowed
as part of the planned development, subject to the twenty percent (20%)
exception requirements of subsection B of this section.
      7.   Buildings may be clustered to preserve river areas and other
environmentally sensitive areas as open space. (2003 Code § 11-06-05) (amd.
Ord. 2202, 3-2-2021)
11-6A-6: OTHER CONDITIONAL USE APPROVALS:
There are certain conditional uses that require consideration of additional
approval criteria unique to the specific application. In reviewing such
applications, the Planning and Zoning Commission must consider the standards of
approval set forth for each conditional use described below in addition to the
general criteria and findings set forth for conditional use permits in
subsection
11-6A-4M of this article. An application and fee are required for each request

to protect adjacent property owners from adverse impacts. (Ord. 2164, 12-5-
2017)
   10.   Adult Daycare Standards: Adult daycare has different use
characteristics from other allowed uses and therefor requires additional
standards to be determined by the Zoning Administrator/building official:
         a.   There shall be adequate access for physically handicapped patrons
of the facility.
         b.   If located on an arterial or collector street, provide for an on

of the establishment is substantially in compliance with the following
requirements and conditions that shall be in addition to those required in
section
11-6A-4 of this article:
      1.   The location of the establishment shall not cause an increase of
commercial traffic in nearby residential neighborhoods, increase general
traffic congestion where serious congestion problems already exist, or cause
other significant adverse impacts on public or private property in the vicinity
of the site. The advice of the appropriate transportation authority shall be
solicited for the purpose of evaluating existing and projected levels of
service and the effects of projected turning movements on highway safety; and
      2.   The internal circulation on the site provides for pedestrians to
walk from parking lots to the lobby entrances without traversing the waiting
lanes for the drive-up window; and
      3.   The waiting lanes be of sufficient length to provide for anticipated
average monthly peak volumes; and
      4.   The design, signage or operational characteristics of the
establishment prevent or discourage vehicles from waiting for service on public
sidewalks or streets; and
      5.   Drive-in waiting lanes be designed so that curbs, gates or other
devices do not prevent a vehicle from leaving a waiting lane; and
      6.   All lights and other illuminated materials shall be designed,
positioned, shielded, directed and located to prevent glare from falling on
adjoining properties. Screening of lights may be required as a secondary
measure of mitigation. Illumination levels shall not exceed two (2) foot-
candles as measured one foot (1') above the ground at property lines shared
with residentially zoned or used parcels; and
      7.   The drive-up window service does not constitute the entire
establishment. This finding may be waived upon showing that the public interest
would be better served if the drive-up window service does constitute the
entire establishment; and
      8.   The design, operation and sign characteristics of the project will
attempt to minimize air pollution and wasteful consumption of fuel. Required
mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Prohibiting all parking spaces that are in addition to the
minimum number of parking spaces required by this title; and
         b.   Retention of existing desirable trees for reasons of species,
location, health, age or other reason as determined and recommended by the city
engineer; and
         c.   Maximum placement of landscaped areas and trees; and
      9.   Landscaping shall screen drive-up aisles from the public right of
way and shall be used to minimize the visual impact of vehicular lights, reader
board signs and directional signs; and
      10.   Drive-through lanes shall be set back at least ten feet (10') from
adjacent residentially zoned or used property. This buffer shall include both
coniferous trees and sound abatement walls; and
      11.   Any drive-up window establishment that is within three hundred feet
(300') of a residential use or zone, as measured along the shortest distance
between the nearest residential property line and any part of the drive-up
portion of the land use, shall not be permitted to utilize outdoor order
speakers; use of a handheld phone or an order window shall be required; and
      12.   In accordance with section
11-6A-4 of this article, the planning and zoning commission has the authority
to limit the hours of operation, and may impose such restrictions on drive-up
window establishments.
   D.   Adult Bookstore, Adult Motion Picture Theater, Adult Performance
Business Or Adult Entertainment Establishment:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of these regulations is to protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city, to
protect the health, safety, and general welfare of employees and patrons of
adult businesses and adult establishments, and to protect children from being
inadvertently exposed to adult material.
      2.   Conditions: In order to approve a conditional use permit for such
uses, the planning and zoning commission must determine that the following
conditions are met:
         a.   Such business shall not be located within one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500') of a school, preschool, daycare facility, public park,

(1,000') of any store, bar, tavern or business that sells, vends, serves,
dispenses or distributes any alcoholic beverages, including, but not limited
to, beer, wine and liquor; and
         e.   Such business shall not be located on a lot or parcel that is
adjacent or contiguous to residential zones, even if separated by an alley.
This condition may be waived; provided, that sixty six and two-thirds percent
(662/3%) of the residentially zoned property owners and residents within five
hundred feet (500') of the proposed use sign a petition approving such a
business; and
         f.   Distance standards shall apply regardless of the political
jurisdiction in which schools, parks or churches, or other adult businesses,
are located; and
         g.   The sign package and exterior building design must be submitted
with the conditional use application for review by the planning and zoning
commission. Advertisements, displays or other promotional materials shall not
be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from the exterior of

definition includes a kindergarten, elementary, junior high or senior high
school, or any special institution of learning under the jurisdiction of the
state department of education, but does not include a vocational or
professional institution or institution of higher education such as a community
or junior college, college or university.
      5.   Construction: These provisions shall not be construed as permitting
any use or act that is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law.
   E.   Lot Area Reduction In R2 District (Combined Residential): Within the R2
district, the lot area for each dwelling unit contained in a building or
buildings on a "lot of record", as defined in section
11-1-3 of this title, may be reduced to not less than two thousand (2,000)
square feet if authorized by a conditional use permit and the following
conditions and restrictions are met and complied with:
      1.   All other applicable zoning and use regulations have been met; and
      2.   The applicant must conclusively prove that the lot cannot feasibly
be developed without reduction in lot area; and
      3.   The improvements upon the lot would not be out of character with the
adjoining and surrounding improvements; and
      4.   Sufficient open space and amenities have been provided to create a
desirable living unit. (2003 Code § 11-06-06)
   F.   Exceptions To Parking Requirements: Parking space requirements for a
particular use as established by this title, may be reduced upon application
for conditional use approval in accordance with this title. Joint or mixed use
of off street parking facilities may be approved by a conditional use permit
submitted in accordance with this title. (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. 2012 Code)
   G.   Conversion Of Nonconforming Use: The conversion of a nonconforming use
to any use other than an allowed use is prohibited, except upon application and
issuance of a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of
section
11-6A-4 of this article; provided, however, that in addition to the
requirements of section
11-6A-4 of this article, such conditional use permit will not be granted unless
the planning and zoning commission makes all of the following findings of fact:
(2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. Ord. 2085, 5-5-2009, eff. 5-5-2009)
      1.   The proposed conversion is compatible with the comprehensive plan,
the purposes of this title and with surrounding land uses; and
      2.   Such proposed conversion will not place an undue burden on existing
transportation and service facilities in the vicinity of the application; and
      3.   Such proposed conversion will be in compliance with all requirements
and provisions of this code; and
      4.   The continuation of a nonconforming use without the benefit of such
conversion would likely result in a deterioration of the neighborhood. (2003
Code § 11-06-06)
   H.   Restoration Of Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming building or mobile
home destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or

restore such building or mobile home to its former use. Such rebuilding or
restoration shall be substantially the same as the former building. (Ord. 2085,
5-5-2009, eff. 5-5-2009)
   I.   Expansion Of Conditional Uses And Legal Nonconforming Uses:
      1.   Findings Required: Expansions to conditional uses or legal
nonconforming uses that exceed twenty percent (20%) of the existing facility
(based on square footage or other dimensional measure) require conditional use
approval by the planning and zoning commission. Approval of such requests shall
be based upon the following findings:
         a.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not alter the zoning classification of the nonconforming use; and
         b.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
conforms to all existing requirements of this code; and
         c.   The proposed conversion, restoration, enlargement or expansion
will not place an undue burden on existing transportation and service
facilities in the vicinity; and
         d.   The proposed enlargement or expansion is not inimical to the best
interest of the surrounding neighborhood.
      2.   Illegal Expansion; Loss Of Status: Any illegal expansion of a
nonconforming use will result in the loss of the legal nonconforming use status
of that project.
   J.   General Height Exceptions: Conditional use approval from the planning
and zoning commission is required to exceed the height limits set forth in this
title. The planning and zoning commission's decision on height exceptions shall
be based upon the criteria set forth in section 11-6A-4M of this article.
   K.   Public Services; Height Exception: Public service poles, towers or
similar installations of a height of seventy feet (70') or greater must be
approved by conditional use permit. The planning and zoning commission must
make the findings required by section 11-6A-4M of this article and the
following additional findings. The pole or tower locations and heights:
      1.   Do not interfere with airport height restrictions; and
      2.   Minimize disturbance to views from established residential areas;
and
      3.   Minimize disturbance to or interference with view of city, state, or
federally registered historic structures; and
      4.   Do not obstruct clear vision triangles or otherwise threaten
motorist or pedestrian safety; and

      6.   Are within route corridors already established for use by rail,
automobile traffic arterials or electrical transmission; and
      7.   Are within route corridors that provide for a satisfactory level of
energy efficient transmission of the product (electrical energy or other
signals); or
      8.   Are the best available alternative placements and heights, even
though they do not comply perfectly with all the above findings.
   L.   Professional, Administrative And Business Offices In M1 And M2

screening, orientation and placement of buildings, parking and access areas)
are provided for the future office to buffer the impact of any conflicting land
uses; and
      2.   The lot or parcel occupied by such offices abuts a public right of
way that separates such lot or parcel from residential or office zones or uses;
or
      3.   Where the use of the subject property for such offices will not
encroach upon or conflict with existing industrial development or that which

removed from any containers unless the containers are of a biodegradable type
in which case the container shall be opened before composting;
      13.   A permanent sign must be posted and maintained at the composting
facility showing the nature of the project, facility name, address and
telephone number of operator, operating hours, materials that may be received
by the facility, and the phrase, "No Dumping Of Garbage, Trash Or Rubbish
Allowed". (2003 Code § 11-06-06; amd. Ord. 2265, 3-4-2025)
11-6A-7: GENERAL EXCEPTIONS:
The planning and zoning commission may grant the following general exceptions
to the requirements of this title, subject to the procedures, provisions and
findings of section
11-6A-4 of this article:
   A.   When a lot or parcel has one-half (1/2) or less of its area in a
district more restrictive than the district that includes the remainder, the
planning and zoning commission may permit the regulation of the less
restrictive district to be applied to the entire lot or parcel. More than one
property owner may combine lots or parcels as a planned development and receive
consideration under this subsection.
   B.   Where a lot located in an R1 or R2 district has a lot line that abuts
property zoned for multiple-family, commercial or industrial uses, the planning
and zoning commission may permit, by conditional use permit pursuant to
subsection 11-6A-4M of this article, up to seventy five feet (75') of adjoining
portion of such lot to be used for any use permitted in the multiple-family R3
district. (2003 Code § 11-06-07)
11-6A-8: SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:
The planning and zoning commission shall review all requests for special
exceptions and make recommendations to the city council.
   A.   Justification: Finding that there are certain uses that because of
their normal nature or design are not commonly permitted in a given district,
but that with special consideration by the applicant to the standards of the
area, impact, design and existing uses, the said use may benefit the immediate
community, the city council may approve, with conditions as outlined below, any
use as requested by an applicant as a conditional use under the special
exceptions provision.
   B.   Intent: It is the intent of this section to promote infilling of built
areas of the community with minimal community impact. In all districts, it is
intended to allow uses of equal or lessor impact than those permitted uses in
the district.
   C.   Procedure For Filing: Any person may apply for a special exception
under this section upon submittal of an application on a form prescribed by the
planning and zoning commission and accompanied by a filing fee as specified
herein. All answers to questions as prescribed in the form shall be used to
validate the application by the zoning administrator/building director. The
zoning administrator/building director shall reject any application that does
not fully contain the following:
      1.   Complete detailed description of the proposed use, including, but
not limited to, the following: hours of operation, number of employees,
expected number of daily customers, anticipated number of needed parking
spaces, noise to be generated, signs and other impacts, where applicable; and
      2.   All applications shall be accompanied by appropriate architectural
and site development plans to scale that shall show building location,
landscaping, prominent existing trees, ground treatment, fences, off street
parking and circulation, location and size of adjacent streets, north arrow and
property lines, drawings of the major exterior elevations showing exterior
building treatment, existing grade and proposed new grades; and
      3.   All applications shall contain a detailed statement explaining how
and why the proposed use is appropriate to the site and neighborhood and why
such use will not adversely impact the site and neighborhood; and
      4.   All applications shall contain a written statement, justified with
submitted drawings, that the applicant does not require or request a variance
in bulk, setback or sign regulations from those required in the existing zoning
district of the proposed location.
   D.   Action By Planning And Zoning Commission:
      1.   At every special exception hearing before the planning and zoning
commission, the commission shall hear all persons interested in the subject
matter then pending before it. Not later than ten (10) days after the
conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall file with the city clerk a
written report of the proceedings before and by the planning and zoning
commission at each hearing and its recommendations to the city council. Any
recommendation of the commission relating to a special exception shall be in
writing and must include in its recommendation all of the following findings of
fact, based upon the evidence presented, and supporting the purposes and
objectives of said special exception:
         a.   This zoning title does not anticipate that such a use could be a
desirable use in the zone under special circumstances; and
         b.   The use will produce an equal or reduced impact upon the site or
neighborhood than would an allowed use; and
         c.   The location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses
in the general neighborhood area and does not place an undue burden on existing
transportation and service facilities in the vicinity; and
         d.   The site is of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed use
and all yards, open spaces, walls and fences, parking, loading, landscaping and
such other features as are required by this title; and
         e.   The site is appropriate for such proposed use and that proper
zoning for the proposed use is not available in the general neighborhood; and
         f.   Natural features and existing trees are appropriately preserved
and integrated with the project and that the finished grading, storm drainage
and landscaping are consistent with the established or contemplated character
of the neighborhood; and
         g.   Access to the property and internal vehicular circulation thereon
are safe and convenient for pedestrians, cyclists, automobiles and service
vehicles and are designed such as to have minimal impact upon the surrounding
neighborhood and traffic operations; and
         h.   The approval, denial or modification of the special exception
does not provide precedent for any other parcel in the city.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission must list, as part of its report
to the city council, those "special circumstances" that are not anticipated by
this title.
      3.   The planning and zoning commission may make recommendations as to
specific conditions for approval that would allow establishment of the proposed
use in a compatible manner with the neighborhood. Such conditions shall be
imposed in accordance with the provisions of subsection 11-6A-4N of this
article. (2003 Code § 11-06-08)
11-6A-9: SIGN VARIANCES:
A sign variance is a request to vary from the standard for background area,
height, illumination, number of signs, location, projection and clearance, or
any other standard prescribed in the sign code, if applicable, except that sign
variances may not be applied to signs that are prohibited. In accordance with
the public hearing requirements of this title, the planning and zoning
commission shall have the authority to deny, approve, or approve with
modifications, a sign variance. All of the following findings of fact shall be
considered and clearly established by the planning and zoning commission when
granting a sign variance in whole or in part:
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless it can be shown that there are
special circumstances applicable to the property involving the size, shape,
topography, location or surroundings that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zoning district that are not the result of voluntary
actions of the applicant; and
   B.   The granting of such sign variance will not constitute a grant of
special privilege that is inconsistent with the limitations upon other property
in the vicinity and zone in which such property is situated; and
   C.   Nonconforming signs in the vicinity surrounding the subject site may
not be used to set the standard for or be compared with applications for new
signs, and shall not be used as justification for a hardship or special
circumstance; and
   D.   The sign variance is the minimum necessary to alleviate the identified
hardship or exceptional circumstance; and
   E.   The approval, denial or modification of any sign variance shall not
provide precedent for any other sign variance in the city; and
   F.   The granting of the sign variance will not be materially detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the properties or improvements in the
vicinity. (2003 Code § 11-06-10)
11-6A-10: VARIANCES TO ZONING TITLE:
   A.   Variance Defined: A "variance" is a modification of the requirements of
this title as to lot size, lot coverage, lot width, street frontage, setback
requirements, parking requirements, loading requirements, or other provisions
of this title affecting the size or shape of a structure or the placement of
the structure upon lots, or the size of lots. A variance shall not be
considered a right or special privilege, but may be granted to an applicant
upon a showing of undue hardship because of characteristics of the site, or
unique circumstances relating to the intended use, and that the variance is not
in conflict with the public interest.
   B.   Application Required: Every person desiring a variance from the
provisions of this title shall submit an application upon a form prescribed by
the zoning administrator/building director, and pay a fee in accordance with
the current fee schedule.
   C.   Public Hearing; Notice: Prior to granting a variance, notice and an
opportunity to be heard shall be provided to property owners, purchasers of
record and residents within the land being considered and adjoining the parcel
under consideration. All requests for variance shall be heard and decided by
the planning and zoning commission in a public hearing scheduled and advertised
in accordance with section
11-3-6 of this title, except that mailed notice be provided to the applicant
and to each property owner, purchaser of record or resident within the land
being considered and adjoining the parcel under consideration (including those
properties across a street, alley, canal or other right of way) advising them
of the time and place of the hearing.
   D.   Action By Commission: The planning and zoning commission must approve,
approve conditionally, deny or modify the variance request. In acting upon such
variance, the planning and zoning commission shall review the findings of staff
and shall grant a variance upon finding that the following are true:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be in conflict with the spirit
and intent of the comprehensive general plan for the city, and will not effect
a change in zoning;
      2.   There is either a hardship associated with the property itself or an
exceptional circumstance relating to the intended use of the property that is
not generally applicable to property or permitted uses in the district;
      3.   The granting of such relief will not be materially detrimental to
the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to the property or
improvements of other property owners, or the quiet enjoyment of such property
or improvement.
   E.   Conditions Of Granting Variance: The planning and zoning commission may
grant a variance as part of a conditional use application without requiring a
separate application and hearing, as long as the notice requirements of
subsection C of this section are met and the findings in subsection D of this
section are made.
   F.   Effective Date Of Approval: Approval of any variance by the planning
and zoning commission shall become final after a lapse of ten (10) calendar
days from the date of the decision to allow for the filing of appeals in
accordance with subsection
11-3-7B of this title.
   G.   Waiver Of Appeal Period: The applicant may request a waiver of the ten
(10) day appeal period for an approved variance. Such request must be filed in
writing and shall be accompanied by the signatures of all adjacent property
owners indicating they do not object to the waiver request. The zoning
administrator/building director shall review all pertinent information and
issue a decision on the request within two (2) working days from the date upon
which the request was filed. The zoning administrator/building director cannot
waive the appeal period for any application to which a written or verbal
protest was submitted.
   H.   Resubmittal Of Application Upon Denial: No application for a variance
that has been denied by the planning and zoning commission (or by the city
council on appeal) shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially the
same form in less than one year from the date of final action.
   I.   Term Of Variance: The term of a variance approval shall not exceed
eighteen (18) months. Within this period, the holder of a variance must
initiate construction of the project.
   J.   Extension Of Variance Approval: The holder of a valid variance approval
may submit a written request for a one year extension of the variance approval
for consideration by the planning and zoning commission. A maximum of three (3)
such extensions may be granted. (2003 Code § 11-06-11)
   K.   Appeal Of Variance Decisions: The decision of the planning and zoning
commission on variance requests may be appealed to the city council in
accordance with subsection
11-3-7B of this title. A letter explaining the basis of the appeal and a fee as
established in the current fee schedule must be submitted to the building
director within the ten (10) day appeal period. (2003 Code § 11-06-11; amd.
2012 Code)
11-6A-11: APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS:
   A.   General Authority: The planning and zoning commission shall hear and
decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by the zoning administrator/
building director in the interpretation or enforcement of this title. In
exercising the above powers, the planning and zoning commission may, in
conformity with the provisions of this title, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as it considers warranted by the evidence before it and to that end shall have
all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   B.   Initiation Of Application: Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
zoning administrator/building director may file an appeal. Such appeal shall be
made within ten (10) calendar days from such decision. If the tenth day falls
on a weekend or holiday, the appeal may be filed on the next workday by five
o'clock (5:00) P.M.
   C.   Application And Fee: Every person wanting to appeal an administrative
decision shall file a notice of appeal stating the grounds for the appeal and
fee with the zoning administrator/building director in accordance with current
fee schedule.
   D.   Action By Zoning Administrator/Building Director: The zoning
administrator/building director shall review all appeal applications for
compliance with the requirements of this section. Upon acceptance of
application for appeal, the zoning administrator/building director shall
transmit to the planning and zoning commission the record of the subject
hearing. The filing of an appeal stays further action (subdivision, conditional
use, etc.), on the request that has been appealed, unless the zoning
administrator/building director determines that a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order that may be granted by the planning and
zoning commission upon application or notice to the zoning administrator/
building director, and upon notice to the chairperson of the commission or by a
court of record.
   E.   Hearings; Publication And Notice: The planning and zoning commission
shall hear the appeal at the public hearing following the cutoff date prior to
which the appeal was submitted. Notice for the public hearing shall be as set
forth in section
11-3-6 of this title.
   F.   Action By Commission: The planning and zoning commission shall
thereafter, upon due cause being shown, confirm wholly or partly, modify or
reverse the decision from which appeal is made, and, not later than ten (10)
days after the conclusion of such hearing, shall file with the city clerk a
written report stating the action taken at such hearing. (2003 Code § 11-06-12)

The city council shall approve, deny or modify any application to amend this
title, to change the boundary of a zoning district, to amend the comprehensive
plan, to annex property into the corporate limits, or to establish a use as a
special exception or special use to this title. Prior to taking action on any
such application, the city council shall receive a written recommendation from
the planning and zoning commission. The city council shall allow public comment
at the council meeting and may hold a formal public hearing, but the city
council shall not be required to advertise for a public hearing. (2003 Code §
11-08-01)
11-6B-2: ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL:
At its next regular meeting after the planning and zoning commission has filed
its recommendations with the city clerk, the city council shall set the date,
time and place of hearing the recommendation of the planning and zoning
commission. Following the hearing, the city council may either approve,
disapprove or modify the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission.
The city council is enjoined from granting less restrictive regulations,
standards or land use classifications than those applied for and as publicized
prior to the public hearing held by the planning and zoning commission. (2003
Code § 11-08-02)
11-6B-3: RESUBMITTAL OF APPLICATION UPON DENIAL:
No application that has been denied by the city council or withdrawn by the
applicant shall be resubmitted in either the same or substantially the same
form or with reference to substantially the same premises or the same purpose

08-03)
11-6B-4: CITY COUNCIL ACTION; AMENDMENT AND RECLASSIFICATION:
The city council is prohibited from amending, supplementing, changing,
modifying or repealing any provisions of this title or the comprehensive plan
until the substance thereof has first been referred to and reported upon by the
planning and zoning commission.
   A.   Amendment And Reclassification: The power to amend this title may be
amended whenever the city council deems that amendment is required for the
public convenience or necessity, or for the general welfare. Any amendment
shall be enacted pursuant to this section, and for purposes of this section,
includes any measure to change district boundaries, establish or disestablish
districts, to change district regulations, to add, repeal or amend district
regulations, and to add, repeal or amend any other provisions of this section,
or the whole of this title.
   B.   Ordinance Required: In the event the city council shall have approved
or modified the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the city
council shall cause to be prepared the appropriate ordinance of amendment.
However, no ordinance amending the "Blackfoot city zoning ordinance" shall
become effective until a public hearing has been held for which fifteen (15)
days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in the
official newspaper of the city. (2003 Code § 11-08-04)
11-6B-5: ANNEXATION:
Requests for annexation of property into the city must be heard by the city
council after receiving recommendation by the planning and zoning commission,
and must meet one or more of the requirements as outlined in Idaho Code, as

11-6B-6: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENT:
The city council, prior to adoption, amendment or repeal of the comprehensive
plan, shall conduct at least one public hearing using the same notice and
hearing procedures as the planning and zoning commission. The city council
shall not hold a public hearing, give notice of a proposed hearing, nor take
action upon the plan, amendments or repeal until recommendations have been
received from the planning and zoning commission. Following the hearing of the
city council, if the council makes a material change in the plan, further
notice and hearing shall be provided before the city council adopts the plan.
For purposes of this section, a "material change" shall mean any modification
of a proposed comprehensive plan amendment which, in the opinion of the city
council, is of such importance that the public interest will be better served
by additional notice and public hearing. (2003 Code § 11-08-06)
11-6B-7: SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Findings: At the hearing before the city council, the city council
shall hear all persons interested in the special exception then pending before
it. The city council shall review the findings and recommendations of the
planning and zoning commission. The city council may approve, disapprove or
modify the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission, but in so
doing must make the following findings:
      1.   The decision to grant or deny the application is based upon the
findings of subsection 11-6A-8D of this chapter.
      2.   The approval, denial or modification of the special exception does
not provide precedent for any other parcel in the city.
      3.   In the event the application is denied, the actions, if any, that
the applicant could take to obtain a special exception permit.
   B.   Council May Impose Restrictive Regulations: The city council, in
amending or modifying the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission,
may impose more restrictive regulations or standards.
   C.   Modification, Extension And Revocation: Upon request of the holder of a
special exception, the city council may modify or extend the term, conditions
and limitations of said permit in accordance with the limitations and
requirements of subsection 11-6A-8D of this chapter. The city council may
revoke or modify, upon notice and hearing, a special exception for the breach
or violation of any condition or limitation of said permit.
   D.   Transferability: Special exceptions shall be nontransferable through
assignment, sale or other means of conveyance without written acknowledgment by
the assignee, purchaser or conveyer in writing of agreement to be bound by
conditions that were set forth in the approval of the application pursuant to
this section. Special exceptions shall not be considered as establishing
binding precedent upon the city.
   E.   Term: A special exception shall become void if not utilized within
eighteen (18) months of issuance, or if the authorized use is abandoned for
more than a period of six (6) months. (2003 Code § 11-08-07)
11-6B-8: DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Authority: Pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-6511A, development
agreements hereby are authorized.
   B.   Purpose: The purpose of a development agreement is to provide a vehicle
for development in areas and for uses where, in the opinion of the city council
or the planning and zoning commission, approval of a requested rezone by itself
does not satisfy the requirements set forth in this title for rezone approval;
but, that use of a development agreement will assure compliance with the
required rezone findings and conclusions. Development agreements can be used
after a determination has been made that the proposed rezone by itself is not
appropriate, unless the use of a development agreement could allow development
to proceed under stricter restrictions than those imposed generally in the
proposed zoning district. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
relieving the property that is subject to development agreement restrictions
from further compliance with all other permit and code requirements applicable
because of the zoning designation of the property. Restrictions imposed upon
property as a result of a development agreement are in addition to all other
zoning ordinance requirements.
   C.   Request Or Requirement For Agreement: After an application for rezone
has been received in the planning department, a request to enter into a
development agreement for that parcel may be submitted by the rezone applicant;
or, a development agreement may be required by city council at council's rezone
hearing, or may be required by city council upon recommendation from the
planning and zoning commission following the commission's rezone hearing.
   D.   Form Of Development Agreement Application: All applications for
development agreements shall be in a form as required by the zoning
administrator/building director.
   E.   Process: Upon receipt of an application for development agreement, the
planning director shall work with the applicant to prepare a development
agreement. The development agreement should address the concerns for the
development that have been proposed by the applicant. Such concerns addressed
may include, but shall not be limited to, density, bulk, site design,
mitigation of impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, appearance, provision of
utilities or public facilities, and restrictions on use.
   F.   Approval Of Development Agreement: Development agreements may be
approved at the sole discretion of the city council. The city council may,
prior to approval, remand the matter to the planning and zoning commission for
consideration and recommendation. In such case, the planning and zoning
commission may recommend approval or denial and may recommend the addition of
conditions, terms, duties or obligations to the development agreement.
   G.   Agreement To Run With Land: The development agreement, or any
modification thereto, and all conditions, terms, duties or obligations included
therein shall run with the land and shall be considered continuing obligations
of the owner, co-owners and each other person acquiring an interest in the
property. An owner, co-owner, each subsequent owner or other person acquiring
an interest in the property that is restricted by a development agreement or
modification adopted pursuant to this section, shall comply with the terms,
conditions, obligations and duties contained in the development agreement or
modification.
   H.   Modification Of Development Agreement: Development agreements may only
be modified after public hearing by the city council. Major modifications as
determined by the zoning administrator/building director require a hearing and
recommendation from the planning and zoning commission prior to the city
council hearing.
   I.   Termination Of Development Agreements:
      1.   Development agreements may be amended or terminated by the city
council, after public hearing, for failure to comply with the commitments
expressed in the development agreement.
      2.   Upon termination of the development agreement, the city council
shall revert the property to the prior zone or in the case of an initial zone
at annexation, to a zone deemed appropriate by the city council. All uses of
the property that are not consistent with the subsequently designated zone
following termination of the development agreement shall cease. The owner of
the property shall apply for a conditional use for the property if the use is
conditionally allowed within the subsequently designated zone.
   J.   Enforcement Of Development Agreements: Development agreements may be
enforced by the city through any means deemed to be appropriate, including, but
not limited to, specific enforcement, injunctive relief, damages or criminal
penalty for violation of this section. The enforcement options available to the
city shall not be considered exclusive. (2003 Code § 11-08-08)

11-7-1: FINDINGS:
The communications act of 1934, as amended by the telecommunications act of
1996 ("the act"), grants the federal communications commission (FCC) exclusive
jurisdiction over the regulation of the environmental effects of radio
frequency (RF) emissions from telecommunications facilities and the regulation
of radio signal interference among users of the RF spectrum. The regulation of
towers and telecommunications facilities will not have the effect of
prohibiting any person from providing wireless telecommunications services in
violation of the act. (2003 Code § 11-07-01)
11-7-2: PURPOSES:
   A.   The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities in
order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the
same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless telecommunications marketplace in the city.
   B.   Specifically, the purposes of this chapter are:
      1.   To regulate the location of wireless telecommunications facilities
in the city;
      2.   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and other telecommunications facilities;
      3.   To minimize adverse visual impact of wireless telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
      4.   To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use wireless telecommunications facilities;
      5.   To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of tower structures to
support antenna and telecommunications facilities;
      6.   To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless
telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed when no
longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
      7.   To ensure that wireless telecommunications facilities are compatible
with surrounding land uses to the greatest extent reasonably possible. (2003
Code § 11-07-02)

   A.   Application Required: No person shall build, erect, use or modify a
wireless telecommunications facility (hereinafter WCF) upon any parcel of land
within any zoning district unless: 1) a complete application to do so has been
filed with the building inspection department; and 2) approval in the form of a
WCF permit has been received from the appropriate body, subject to the
provisions set out in this chapter. All WCFs are prohibited from interference
with city and public safety communication systems and/or area television or
radio broadcasts. Applications must be accompanied by the appropriate fee as
set by resolution of the city council.
   B.   Anchor Restrictions: Guywires may only be used to anchor an antenna,
antenna array, or support structure to an existing building to which the
antenna, antenna array, or support structure is attached.
   C.   Residential Zones: In residential zoning districts, freestanding WCFs,
including towers, are prohibited except on public school property used for
school purposes. Freestanding WCFs also are prohibited within two hundred feet
(200') of any residentially zoned parcel, regardless of the underlying zoning
district on which the WCF might be located. WCFs attached to utility poles or
facade attached to nonresidential buildings are allowed by administrative staff
permit, subject to application procedures set out in this chapter and a twenty
one (21) day notice and comment period requirement, and subject to the
standards set out in this chapter, including those set out in section
11-7-18 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing regarding WCFs placed on
public school property, the tower height in any event may not exceed the
distance from the center of the tower at ground level to the edge of the school
property.
   D.   Nonresidential Zones: In nonresidential zones, tower WCFs are permitted
by means of an approved special WCF permit. Other WCFs are permitted subject to
the provisions of this chapter.
   E.   Special Use Districts: Applications submitted for a WCF permit within a
special use district, such as a nationally recognized historic district or
site, must be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness from the
appropriate review board or commission of the city.
   F.   Exceptions:
      1.   The city council may approve a lease agreement or right of way use
permit that allows a tower to be placed on city owned property in any zoning
district within the city limits, without special WCF permit procedures being
required, after a public hearing on the matter, if the city council deems it to
be in the best interests of the city.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission may approve an application for a
tower in a residential zone with a special WCF permit upon a satisfactory
showing that applicant's coverage requirements necessitate location within that
zone, and that the WCF can meet or exceed standards set out in this chapter.
"Satisfactory showing" shall include certification from a qualified engineer as
to the coverage requirements and insufficiency of other zoning districts to
provide the same, and that a tower facility, rather than another WCF support
system, is necessary. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs for
professional services to provide information deemed necessary by the planning
and zoning commission in order to reach its decision. Appeal from the decision
may be made to the city council, provided the request is submitted, in writing,
to the city clerk within ten (10) days following the issuance of the decision.
(2003 Code § 11-07-04)
11-7-5: SITING AND FACILITY PRIORITIES:
Based on potential aesthetic impact and subject to other restrictions set out

follows: roof attached, facade attached, utility pole attached and freestanding
tower. WCFs shall be located in the following priority order:
   A.   Collocation on an existing tower, structure or building. The applicant
shall have the burden of proving that there are no feasible existing structures
upon which to collocate as described below.
   B.   On city owned property.
   C.   In areas where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings and other
structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
   D.   On other nonresidential buildings or vacant nonresidentially zoned
land.
   E.   In residential districts (nontower facilities only) subject to
restrictions in this chapter. (2003 Code § 11-07-05)
11-7-6: COLLOCATION REQUIRED:
   A.   No new tower shall be permitted unless the tower is designed and built
to be able to support another carrier's WCF comparable in weight, size, and
surface area to the telecommunications facilities installed on said tower by
the applicant. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant provides
evidence of the failure of applicant's good faith effort to install or
collocate the applicant's telecommunications facilities on city owned towers or
usable antenna support structures or on towers located on property leased from
the city located within a one-half (1/2) mile radius of the proposed tower
site, including good faith efforts to negotiate lease rights, to no avail and
evidence of the following:
      1.   Lack of existing towers or structures located within the geographic
area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
      2.   Insufficiency of design of existing tower or structures to meet
applicant's engineering requirements as shown in the master development plan;
      3.   Insufficiency of existing towers or structures to support the
proposed antenna and related equipment;
      4.   That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna; and/or
      5.   The fees, costs of contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for share are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are
presumed to be unreasonable.

not increase the volume of space enclosed by the building and do not project
into any required yard more than two feet (2'); provided, that an unroofed
stair and landing, together with a railing, may project not more than three
feet (3') into the minimum setback requirement.
      2.   Chimney, not more than eight feet (8') in width projecting no more
than twenty four inches (24") into the minimum setbacks.
      3.   Access driveways providing reasonable access to required private or
public areas, including garages. Driveways that extend through the setback in
other than a perpendicular manner may be approved if due to physical
limitations of the site or for aesthetic or safety purposes. The planning

   A.   Permitted: Any use or structure lawfully occupying a building or land
at the effective date hereof, or subsequent amendments thereto, or at the time
of annexation or rezone, which does not conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, shall be deemed a nonconforming use and may
continue to operate as it did prior to the ordinance. A nonconforming use shall
exist if the owner or developer of such use has lawfully, in reliance on
existing laws, ordinances or permits, made substantial expenditures or
otherwise committed himself, to a substantial disadvantage, before the law,
ordinance or permit is changed. Substantial shall be measured by consideration
of all factors evidencing a change of position.
   B.   Enlargement Of Nonconforming Use: No nonconforming use may be enlarged,
expanded or altered except to make it a conforming use. Maintenance and minor
repairs necessary to keep a nonconforming use in sound condition during the

a building has been discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months, or
in the case of a building originally designed for a commercial or industrial
use for a continuous period of one year; or whenever there is otherwise evident
a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming use, such
use shall not thereafter be reestablished, and the use of the premises
thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations for the district. Any
nonconforming use that is illegally expanded shall lose its nonconforming use
status.
   D.   Establishing Legal Nonconforming Use: A legal nonconforming use may be
established upon application through the staff level review process outlined in
subsection
11-3-5A1 of this title, subject to review of verification documentation
submitted by the applicant. Following is a list of some, but not all, types of
documentation that are accepted as verification of a legal nonconforming use

Wherever the regulations made under the authority of this title require a
greater width or size of yards or courts, are more restrictive as to height of
building or permit of a less number of stories, or require a greater percentage
of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose standards that are more restrictive
than are required by any other city ordinance or regulation, the provisions of
this title shall govern. Wherever the provisions of any other city ordinance or
regulation require a greater width or size of yards or courts, or are more
restrictive as to the height of buildings or permit of a less number of
stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or

12-1-10: INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY:
   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title
shall be held to be the minimum requirements. More stringent provisions may be
required if it is demonstrated that such standards are necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or
annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or other provision of law
except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or
other provision of law, the provision that is more restrictive or imposes the
standards most likely to protect the public health, safety and general welfare
shall control.
   C.   These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, private
covenant or any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that where
the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher
standards or regulation, the requirements of these regulations shall govern
irrespective of private contractual provision.
   D.   The provisions of this title are severable. If any section, sentence,
clause or phrase of this title is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, the decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this

section or provision existing at the time of adoption, or vacate or annul any
rights obtained by any person, firm or corporation by lawful action of the city
except as expressly provided for herein. (2003 Code § 12-01-10)
12-1-12: RESERVATIONS AND REPEALS:
Upon the adoption of these regulations according to law, the previously enacted
subdivision ordinance of the city, as amended, hereby is repealed, except as
provided above. (2003 Code § 12-01-11)
12-1-13: EXCEPTIONS AND WAIVERS OF CONDITIONS:
   A.   Where strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of
these regulations may be better served by an alternative proposal, the city
council may approve exceptions and/or waiver of conditions to these
regulations. The granting of an exception or waiver of conditions shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. The
city council shall not permit exceptions and/or waiver of conditions unless it
finds, based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case, that:
      1.   The granting of the exception, or waiver of conditions will not be
detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other
property.
      2.   The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property.
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular and
unnecessary hardship to the owner would result if the strict application of
these regulations is applied.
      4.   The change sought will not vary the provisions of the zoning
ordinance or comprehensive plan, except that those documents may be amended in
the manner prescribed by law.
   B.   In approving exceptions or waivers of conditions, the city council may
require conditions that will secure the purposes of this title. An exception is
any alternative design, or proposed change in subdivision ordinance
requirements that is requested by the developer. The exception requested must
be reviewed as an integral part of the overall review process as outlined in
this title. A request for an exception shall be submitted in writing by the
developer at the time that the subdivision application is filed and shall be
reviewed along with the subdivision. The request shall specify which ordinance
provisions shall be subject to exception along with the proposed changes and
the reasons why the changes are necessary. The planning and zoning commission
shall make a recommendation to the city council specific to the exception
requested. The city council shall render a decision on the requested exception
at the time the subdivision is reviewed.
   C.   A waiver of conditions is a request to change the conditions of
subdivision approval as agreed to in the development agreement. A request for a
waiver of conditions must be in writing and submitted to the planning
department prior to acceptance by the city of construction improvements or
recordation of the final plat. The request shall specify the condition needing
to be waived and the reasons the waiver would be justified. Upon receipt of a
request, the administrator will place the request on the agenda of the planning
and zoning commission for hearing. Notice of hearing shall be provided in the
same manner as hearing for subdivision approval. The request will be reviewed
and the planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation to the city
council. The city council shall review the recommendation and shall render a
decision on the waiver of conditions. (2003 Code § 12-01-12)

12-2-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedures for review and
action on applications for subdivisions. The procedure is intended to provide
orderly and expeditious processing of subdivision applications. (2003 Code §
12-03-01)
12-2-2: PREAPPLICATION:
   A.   Submit Preliminary Plat: Prior to submittal of a subdivision
application, the developer shall submit six (6) copies of a preliminary plat
plan to the site plan review committee.
   B.   Review Scheduled: The city engineer shall schedule and hold the
preliminary site plan review within thirty (30) days from the submittal date,
unless the developer agrees to additional time.
   C.   Review: A preliminary site plan review allows the developer an
opportunity to meet with municipal staff and other representatives deemed
appropriate by the city engineer. A representative of the various public works
departments shall be invited to all preliminary site plan review meetings.
Items to be reviewed:
      1.   The general subdivision process.
      2.   Overall design, lot sizes and street layout.
      3.   Preliminary utility design.
      4.   Conformity to the comprehensive plan.
      5.   Potential off site impacts/mitigation.
      6.   Off site/on site improvements.
   D.   Additional Review: Additional preliminary site plan review may be
scheduled by the city engineer when, in the collective judgment of staff, the
proposed subdivision is extraordinarily complex, proposes large impacts to city
utility systems, or requires extraordinary staff time. Total time for
preliminary site plan review shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of
submittal unless the developer agrees to additional time.
   E.   Written Report: At the conclusion of the preliminary site plan review
process, the city engineer shall provide the developer with a written site plan
review report, which includes a statement of issues, concerns and
recommendations deemed important by the city staff based upon the level of
information available at the time of preliminary site plan review. The site
plan review report allows the developer to submit an application for
subdivision review. A site plan review report states that the proposed
subdivision has been reviewed by appropriate staff and agencies and is eligible
to submit an application and does not constitute an approval in any way. Such
notice may include comments, concerns and recommendations of the staff and
participating agencies.
   F.   Validity; Extension: A site plan review report is valid for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days. The city engineer may extend the duration of
site plan review report for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days if
conditions of the preliminary site plan review have not changed materially.
After expiration of a site plan review report, the developer shall be required
to resubmit for a preliminary site plan review.
(2003 Code § 12-03-02; amd. Ord. 2246, 10-3-2- 2023)
12-2-3: SUBDIVISION APPLICATION:
   A.   Submittal: Applications for subdivisions shall be submitted and
accepted at least forty five (45) days before the date of the public hearing at
which it is to be reviewed. Minor subdivisions may be submitted to the city
engineer at any time. No application for a subdivision shall be accepted until
a preliminary site plan review has been completed and a written site plan
review report has been issued by the city engineer. The city engineer may waive
the preliminary site plan review for a minor subdivision.
   B.   Direction Of City Engineer: The developer shall have the option of
seeking the direction of the city engineer as to which approvals are required
and the appropriate review process, or of filing an application the developer
believes to be appropriate. The city engineer's determination shall be presumed
to be correct. (2003 Code § 12-03-03)
12-2-4: SUBMITTAL OF SUBDIVISION APPLICATION:
   A.   Intent: The documents submitted are intended to provide the approving
authority with sufficient information and data to assure compliance with all
municipal codes and specifications and ensure that the proposed development

12-2-5: MINOR SUBDIVISION REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of minor subdivision review is to provide a
simplified procedure for processing minor subdivisions administratively. Minor
subdivisions are subdivisions of four (4) or fewer lots that create no new
streets. The process is intended for the creation of lots along existing
streets where infrastructure is available. A minor subdivision may be part of a
planned unit development. A developer proposing to create additional lots on
the same original parcel within a single five (5) year period (multiple minor
subdivisions from 1 parcel) as a minor subdivision may be required by the city
engineer to use the full subdivision review process if the city engineer
determines that the multiple minor subdivisions may have a significant impact
on public facilities to be used by the development.
   B.   Schedule Staff Review: Upon receipt of a complete application, the city
engineer shall schedule a minor subdivision review with staff and the
developer. A date for the review will be established within seven (7) days from
the date of application acceptance.
   C.   Copies Of Documents Submitted; Notice To Adjacent Property Owners: The
city engineer shall provide copies of submitted documents, as necessary, to
outside agencies and jurisdictions, that, in the opinion of the city engineer,
may be affected by the proposal. In addition, the city engineer shall provide
written notice to the owners of property adjacent to the property proposed for
development. The notice shall provide the adjacent property owners a plan of
the minor subdivision, general information concerning the proposal, and the
time frame for submitting written comments. The period of time for comment or
response shall not be less than fourteen (14) days nor greater than twenty one
(21) days from the date of notice.
   D.   Hearing Officer; Review: The city engineer shall act as hearing officer
and shall conduct a minor subdivision review, along with appropriate staff, to
ensure that all applicable ordinance provisions are followed or completed.
Minor subdivision review shall include but not be limited to:
      1.   Review of lot size and dimensions for conformance to the zoning
ordinance.
      2.   Determination that there are adequate provisions to serve the minor
subdivision with sewer and water.
      3.   Review of the location of fire hydrants.
      4.   Review the location for the installation of streetlights if
determined to be necessary by the public works department.
      5.   Determine if mitigation of any impact is warranted.
      6.   Define the scope of improvements and dedications required (curb,
sidewalk, paving, water, sewer, drainage, easements, right of way dedication,
etc.).
      7.   Evaluation of the location of potential rights of way to access
adjoining parcels.
   E.   Decision; Notice: A decision shall be rendered within seven (7) days of
the review unless circumstances require otherwise, such circumstances to be set
forth in writing to the applicant. The city engineer shall, by written
decision, grant approval, approval with conditions, or deny the minor
subdivision. Notice of the action taken by the city engineer shall also be
mailed to the owners of real property adjacent to the minor subdivision. A
decision to deny shall be in writing and indicate reasons for denial and
indicate what steps are necessary to obtain approval. In the case of approval
or approval with conditions, a memorandum of understanding shall be prepared
that details the conditions of approval and the responsibilities of the
developer. The memorandum of understanding shall be signed by the developer and
the city engineer prior to proceeding to plat review.
   F.   Appeal: The developer or any affected party may appeal the decision of
the city engineer by filing a notice of appeal with the city council, with a
copy to the city engineer, no later than fourteen (14) days after the date of
the city engineer's decision. The appeal shall set forth in clear and concise
fashion the basis for appeal. Upon receipt, the city clerk shall schedule the
appeal for consideration at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city
council at which it can be accommodated. The appellant shall be allowed to make
a presentation under procedures established by the city council. Those opposing
the appeal shall have an opportunity to present and rebut the appellant's
presentation. Staff may provide a staff report. The city council, after
consideration of the elements of the appeal, shall render a decision affirming
or reversing the city engineer within forty five (45) days from the date on
which the notice of appeal is filed, unless circumstances require that more
time be taken to reach a decision, the reason therefor being stated in a formal
motion by the city council.
   G.   Effective Period Of Approval; Extension: The approval of a minor
subdivision shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of
approval. If a plat is not submitted for approval within the one year period,
the minor subdivision approval shall be null and void, and the developer shall
be required to submit a new application. Prior to the expiration date of the
effective period, the developer may request an extension, in writing, from the
city engineer. The city engineer may grant an extension, not to exceed twelve
(12) months, upon a showing of good cause by the developer. The city engineer
shall decide a request for extension within fourteen (14) days of the receipt
of the written request. The developer may appeal the city engineer's decision
to deny extension to the mayor.
   H.   Amendments:
      1.   At any time after minor subdivision approval and before submission
of a subdivision plat, the developer may request of the city engineer that an
amendment be made to the minor subdivision plan or to conditions of approval.
If the proposed amendment is a minor change to the plan and consistent with
conditions of approval, the city engineer may grant the amendment in writing
within ten (10) days of the request, unless the city engineer determines that
additional time is necessary for reasons stated in writing. If the amendment is
major or involves a change in the conditions of approval, the city engineer
shall schedule a review with staff, and notify adjoining landowners, in his
discretion, to review the proposed amendment. The date for the review shall be
scheduled within twenty one (21) days of the request.
      2.   Upon completion of the review for the amendment request, the city
engineer may grant the amendment if the minor subdivision is not substantially
changed and does, in fact, remain a minor subdivision. If the proposed
amendment changes the plan to cause it to become a subdivision, the city
engineer shall disapprove the amendment and notify the developer to adhere to
the approved plan or to apply for the full subdivision review process. (2003
Code § 12-03-05)
12-2-6: SUBDIVISION REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this process is to provide a timely and
efficient review of subdivisions. A subdivision is any division of a lot,
tract, or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots and accompanied by proposed
new streets or extensions to existing streets, and/or extensions of municipal
sewer and water services. A subdivision may be part of a planned unit
development (PUD).
   B.   Official Submission Date: The date that a completed application is
accepted by the city engineer and the zoning administrator shall be the
official submission date.
   C.   Public Hearing Before Planning And Zoning Commission; Notice: Upon
acceptance of an application for subdivision approval along with all of the
required submittals, the zoning administrator shall schedule a public hearing
before the planning and zoning commission. The public hearing shall be held at
least forty five (45) days after but within seventy five (75) days of the
official submission date if the agenda of the planning and zoning commission
permits. The zoning administrator shall:
      1.   Submit a notice for publication in the official newspaper of the
city. Such notice shall provide the time and place of the public hearing, a
description of the location of the subdivision, a brief statement summarizing
the request, and a vicinity map. Notice shall be published at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the public hearing.
      2.   Mail notices to all owners of property within three hundred feet
(300') of the boundaries of the land proposed to be subdivided and to such
owners as the zoning administrator believes should receive notice. The
developer shall provide a current mailing list of all property owners within
three hundred feet (300') of the boundaries of the subdivision. Such notice
shall provide the time and place of the public hearing, a description of the
location of the subdivision, a brief statement summarizing the request and a
vicinity map. Notice shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
public hearing.
      3.   Post notice on the property. The notice shall provide the time and
place of the public hearing, a brief statement summarizing the request, and a
phone number to call for information. Notice shall be posted on the property at
least seven (7) days prior to the public hearing.
      4.   Notice and request for comment shall be mailed to agencies,
utilities and other jurisdictions deemed appropriate by the city engineer or
required by Idaho Code no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the public
hearing date. The notice and request for comment shall include application
information, notice of the public hearing date, additional staff comments and a
date by which comments are to be received. A copy of the application and a copy
of the subdivision plan shall be included.
   D.   Report Required: The zoning administrator shall prepare a report for
the planning and zoning commission that provides information about the site and
the subdivision to aid the commission in making a recommendation. The report

   E.   Recommendation To City Council: After the planning and zoning
commission has reviewed the subdivision plan, preliminary construction plans,
staff report and testimony and exhibits submitted at the public hearing, the
commission shall forward a recommendation to the city council. The planning and
zoning commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or
disapproval of the subdivision within thirty (30) days of the public hearing,
unless circumstances require a longer review period for reasons set forth in a
motion adopted by the commission. The zoning administrator shall notify the
developer, in writing, within seven (7) days of the action by the planning and
zoning commission. Such notification shall specify any recommended conditions
or changes requested and shall advise the developer that the subdivision will
be placed on the agenda of the city council only upon the developer's written
request.

conditions of approval. If the proposed amendment is a minor change to the
plan, the city engineer may grant the amendment in writing. If the amendment is
major or involves a substantial change in the conditions of approval, the city
engineer shall schedule a public hearing at least thirty (30) days after the
receipt of the request. The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public
hearing on the proposed amendment in accordance with the same requirements for
a public hearing for subdivision approval.
   E.   Public Hearing For Major Amendments: A public hearing on a proposed
major amendment shall be limited to whether the proposed amendment should or
should not be approved. The planning and zoning commission may approve, approve
with modifications, or disapprove any proposed major amendment and may make any
modifications in the terms and conditions of subdivision approval reasonably
related to the proposed amendment. The planning and zoning commission shall
render a decision on the proposed amendment within thirty (30) days from the
date of the public hearing or in such time as it may determine by motion
approved by the planning and zoning commission. Any proposed changes to
conditions shall be forwarded to the city council for review as would be the
case for a new subdivision proposal. Any changes approved by the city council
shall be included in an addendum to the development agreement for the project.
(2003 Code § 12-03-07)

application. The plans, subject to review and approval, shall show proposed
phasing boundaries. Proposed interim or temporary solutions to sanitary sewer
and water systems and to the handling of traffic on local streets, collectors
and arterials within the subdivision, shall be shown on plans submitted along
with a narrative description of assurance of completion of permanent system
improvements.
   B.   Development Agreement: The development agreement for each subdivision
must ensure that the dedication of public streets and improvements will occur
according to the phasing plans, subject to conditions imposed by the city
council during subdivision review. The city council may, in the interest of
public safety and welfare, require that certain collector streets and arterials
be dedicated and constructed in their entirety regardless of the phasing plan.
   C.   Guarantees: In approving a subdivision to be developed in phases, the
city council may require that the development agreement indicate the phasing
plans and that the amounts calculated for guarantees are commensurate with the
phasing plan. The city council may require that the guarantee amount be that
amount calculated for each phase and may defer the remaining amounts of the
guarantee until the remaining sections of the subdivision are platted.
   D.   Phasing Plan: A phasing plan shall coordinate required infrastructure
systems, dedications, off site improvements, open space/parks, landscaping,
private utilities, or other elements of a subdivision. The plan may indicate
times or triggering mechanisms for improvements. Agreements between the
developer and the city concerning the acceleration or deceleration of
development of the subdivision may be included in the development agreement.
Provisions of a development agreement shall endeavor to the greatest extent
possible to tie together the contingencies of development of a phased project.

Should amendments to the agreement be necessary and if all parties are in
agreement, an addendum to the agreement shall be negotiated subject to review
by the city attorney for signature of the parties. Either party may propose
amending the agreement by notifying other parties to the agreement in writing
of the nature of the amendment and the reasons why the amendment is necessary.

or households) to ensure the continued usefulness of the system.
   J.   Fire Hydrants And Water Mains: Adequate fire protection shall be
required in accordance with the appropriate fire district standards.
   K.   Street Name Signs: Street name signs shall be installed in the
appropriate locations at each street intersection in accordance with the local
standards and shall comply with title 8, chapter 5 of this code.
   L.   Sidewalks And Pedestrian Walkways: Sidewalks shall be required on both
sides of the street and shall be five feet (5') in width, except in business
districts, where the sidewalks shall be eight feet (8') in width.
   M.   Greenbelt: Greenbelts or landscaping screening may be required for the
protection of residential properties from adjacent major arterial streets,
waterways, railroad rights of way or other features. Subdivision plats shall
show the location of any greenbelt areas.
   N.   Street Lighting: Streetlights shall be installed throughout the
subdivision. A subdivider shall conform to the requirements of the city and the
public utility providing such light. (2003 Code § 12-08-02)
   O.   Secondary Water Systems For Irrigation: The delivery of irrigation
water shall be executed in accordance with Idaho Code section 31-3805 and the
following:
      1.   The use of the city's potable water supply as the primary source of
irrigation water in all new developments shall be prohibited. For purposes of
this subsection, the term "new development" means any new subdivision or any
development of any parcel of land of three-fourths (3/4) of an acre or larger
that is not part of a subdivision. The existence of a secondary water system
for irrigation within a subdivision does not prohibit the use of municipal
water services for irrigation when the secondary water system is not reasonably
available or operational.
      2.   All new developments shall include an operating pressure irrigation
system constructed to city standards and approved by the city engineer. There
shall be no cross connections allowed between the irrigation system and the
city's domestic water system. The city engineer shall encourage developers to
participate in a regional system as long as the pump station is operational
before the first building permit is issued for that station's service area.
      3.   The city may assume ownership and responsibility for the
development, maintenance, repair, and any associated costs involved with the
secondary irrigation water system. When ownership is assumed, the city will
administer these systems as separate enterprise funds within the city's water
department, assessing only those charges necessary to maintain and operate the
specific systems developed. These charges will include all necessary and
appropriate charges from irrigation entities.
      4.   The city may authorize in specific cases a variance from the
requirement of a pressure irrigation system, if not contrary to the public
interest. In order to qualify for a variance the following information must be
provided for consideration:
         a.   A letter from the irrigation district, company, or other purveyor
of water explaining the difficulties, expense, or other issues with supplying
the development secondary water; and
         b.   Information verifying whether or not the development has visible
access to surface water; and
         c.   An irrigation study may be required to confirm that a secondary
water system is not reasonably available or operational in relation to the size
of development; and
         d.   Anytime surface water is not available, a feasibility study will
be required for the use of municipal water services for irrigation; and
         e.   Such other information as may be deemed necessary by the city.
         f.   Special conditions may include, but are not limited to, small
developments in terms of acreage, developments without viable access to
irrigation water delivery, or developments without water shares.
         g    Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit.
      5.   The city engineer shall not authorize a variance from the
requirement of an operating pressure irrigation system unless an alternate
provision has been approved by the city engineer. Alternates may include, but
shall not be limited to, required xeriscaping (i.e., landscaping in ways that
do not require supplemental irrigation), payment of an in lieu fee equal to the
estimated cost of construction of an operating pressure irrigation system
(including land acquisition), or some combination of these or other acceptable
options.
      6.   All preliminary plats shall be accompanied by proof of transferable
irrigation water rights. All subdividers are required to complete the transfer
of irrigation water rights and installation of the irrigation water system as
proposed. One share of water for each acre of property within the subdivision
shall be deeded to the city before the filing of the final plat for use in the
pressurized irrigation system. (Ord. 2154, 3-7-2017, eff. 3-7-2017; amd. Ord.
2269, 6-3-2025)
12-5B-3: CITY PARTICIPATION IN EXTENSION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   In order to encourage infill development and to provide developers
limited financial relief from past development policy oversights, the city may,
at its own discretion, participate with land developers in extending water
mains, sewer mains and stormwater mains. The city may participate in extending
these utilities up to one hundred fifty feet (150') per development and up to
an accumulative total of one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') per utility,
per fiscal year. Footage will be measured from the mainline connection and
through the perpendicular frontage of the corner lot. Minimum pipe sizes are as
follows:
        Water main - 8"
        Sewer main - 8"
        Storm drain laterals - 12"
   B.   If larger diameter pipes are required, the developer shall pay the
price difference between the minimum size and the required size.
   C.   The city may, at its discretion, perform the work with city crews,
equipment and materials, or pay a portion of the contracted price, or a
combination of both, whichever is in the best interest of the city.
   D.   The city's participation in infill development does not include fire
hydrants, service lines or appurtenances, unless it is deemed in the city's
best interest.
   E.   Infill participation is limited to utility extensions within rights of
way that are perpendicular to streets with utilities. Terms of the
participation shall be detailed in the development agreement. Development prior
to September 18, 2001, is not eligible. (2003 Code § 12-08-03)
12-5B-4: RESERVED UTILITY LINES (REIMBURSEMENT FOR CITY UTILITY EXTENSION
COSTS):
   A.   Developer Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the developer to
bear the cost of installing city utilities (i.e., water, sewer, storm drains)
through the entire frontage of a development.
   B.   Requirement To Pay; Inflation Factor: If or when development occurs
opposite of the development, the developer who bore the cost of installing the
city utilities may at his/her option require the new developer to pay for half
the cost of said improvements. A three percent (3%) inflation factor per year
may be applied. Cost of said improvements must be broken down into per foot
basis.
   C.   Per Foot Cost To Be Filed: If the original developer wishes to become
eligible for reimbursement, he/she must provide to the city a per foot cost of
each utility line that will be filed with the development file. The city
engineer will then determine if the costs are reasonable and in agreement with
this section. If and when new development occurs opposite to said development,
the city engineer shall determine how many feet of the new development should
be paid toward existing utilities.
   D.   Time Limit: A ten (10) year limit shall be placed on any eligible
reimbursements.
   E.   Utilities Beneficiaries: Anyone who may connect to the new lines in a
perpendicular fashion most likely on the opposite side of the public right of
way from said development.
   F.   Exceptions: Consecutive developments (not opposite to said development)
are not expected to participate in the cost of said improvements, but rather
become eligible for this policy.
   G.   City Acting As Developer: In cases where the city acts as the
developer, the city may impose said "reserved utility lines" clauses.
Furthermore, no time limits will be placed on "city" installed lines. (2003
Code § 12-08-04)
12-5B-5: EXCEPTION TO REQUIRED PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Application; Hearing: A subdivider may apply to the planning and zoning
commission for an exception or modification to providing one or more of the
required public improvements set forth in section
12-5B-2 of this article. Upon application for such exception, the planning and
zoning commission shall conduct a public hearing on the matter. Such
application must be made in conjunction with the initial application by the
subdivider.
   B.   Considerations: The planning and zoning commission may take one or more
of the following factors, in addition to other relevant factors, into
consideration in determining whether to recommend approval of the exception:
      1.   Size of the lot(s).
      2.   Drainage factors, including drainage qualities of the soil.
      3.   Availability of city water and sewer services.
      4.   Aesthetics of the surrounding and adjoining neighborhoods.
   C.   Recommendation; Conditions: Upon conducting a public hearing on the
matter, the planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval or denial
of the requested exception or modification to the city council. The planning
and zoning commission may attach conditions to their recommendation.
   D.   City Council Consideration: The issue shall then be scheduled to be
presented to the city council at the next regularly scheduled city council
meeting. A public hearing shall not be required at the city council meeting,
but may be held in the discretion of the mayor. At such meeting, the city
council may accept, reject, partially accept, or partially reject the
recommendations of the planning and zoning commission. In addition, the city
council may add, delete or modify conditions to granting the exception. (2003

   D.   Crosswalks: In blocks over six hundred feet (600') long, pedestrian
crosswalks may be required by the planning and zoning commission in locations
deemed necessary to public health, convenience and necessity. Such crosswalk
shall be eight feet (8') wide and be straight from street to street. Sidewalk
easements may be required through the blocks to permit foot traffic.
   E.   Dimensions: Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the
requirements of this title.
   F.   Future Arrangements: Where parcels of land are subdivided into
unusually large lots (such as when large lots are approved for septic tanks),
the parcels shall be divided, where feasible, so as to allow for future
resubdividing into smaller parcels. Lot arrangements shall allow for the
ultimate extension of adjacent streets through the middle of wide blocks.
Whenever such future subdividing or lot splitting is contemplated, the plan
thereof shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission prior to the
taking of such action.
   G.   Side Lot Lines: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
to straight lines or radical to curved street lines.
   H.   Corner Lots: Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to

as trees, watercourses, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets) shall
be preserved in the design of the subdivision.
   C.   Special Developments: In the case of planned unit developments and
large scale developments, the planning and zoning commission may require
sufficient park or open space facilities of acceptable size, location and site
characteristic that may be suitable for the proposed development.
   D.   Shown On Master Plan: Where a proposed park, playground, school or
other public use shown in a master plan is located in whole or in part within a
subdivision, the subdivision will dedicate or reserve adequate space for such
purpose in such area within the subdivision when the mayor and city council
finds the requirement to be reasonably necessary to the public health and
welfare.
   E.   Acceptance By City Required: The requiring of the dedication of public
spaces as provided in this title shall not constitute an acceptance of the
dedication by the city, unless such dedication is accepted by the mayor and
city council. (2003 Code § 12-07-28)

statement that has been prepared by an attorney that adequately assures the
compliance of the proposed cemetery with the procedural management requirements
that are outlined in Idaho Code title 27. (2003 Code § 12-09-05)
12-7-6: SUBDIVISION WITHIN FLOODPLAIN:
   A.   Flood Areas: For any proposed subdivision that is located within a
floodplain, the developer shall provide the planning and zoning commission with
a development plan of adequate scale and supporting documentation that will
show and explain at least the following:
      1.   Location of all planned improvements.
      2.   The location of the floodway and the floodway fringe per engineering
practices as specified by the army corps of engineers.
      3.   The location of the present water channel.
      4.   Any planned rerouting of waterways.
      5.   All major drainageways.
      6.   Areas of frequent flooding.
      7.   Means of floodproofing buildings.

   B.   Justification For Development:
      1.   Upon the determination that buildings are planned within the
floodplain or that alterations of any kind are anticipated within the
floodplain area that will alter the flow of water, the developer shall
demonstrate conclusively to the planning and zoning commission that such
development will not present a hazard to life, limb or property, or will not
have adverse effects on the safety, use or stability of a public way or
drainage channel or the natural environment.
      2.   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if levees, fills,
structures or other features within the proposed subdivision will individually
or collectively significantly increase flood flows, heights or damages. If only
part of a proposed subdivision can be safely developed, the City Council shall
limit development to that part and shall require the development proceed
consistent with that determination. (2003 Code § 12-09-06)
12-7-7: SUBDIVISION WITHIN AN AREA OF CRITICAL CONCERN:
   A.   General: Hazardous or unique areas may be designated as areas of
critical concern by the City Council or by the State. Special consideration
shall be given to any proposed development within an area of critical concern
to assure that the development is necessary and desirable and in the public
interest in view of the existing unique conditions. Hazardous or unique areas
that may be designated as areas of critical concern are as follows:
      1.   Avalanche paths.
      2.   Earthquake locations.
      3.   Unstable soils.
      4.   Unique animal life.

environmental impact statement along with the preliminary plat application for
any development that is proposed within an area of critical concern.
   C.   Content Of Environmental Impact Statement: The content of the
environmental impact statement shall usually be prepared by an
interdisciplinary team of professionals that shall provide answers to the
following questions:
      1.   What changes will occur to the area of environmental concern as a
result of the proposed development?
      2.   What corrective action or alternative development plans could occur
so as not to significantly change the area of environmental concern?
      3.   What changes in the area of environmental concern are unavoidable?
      4.   What beneficial or detrimental effect would the development have on
the environment (i.e., animal life, plant life, social concerns, economic
noise, visual and other)? (2003 Code § 12-09-07)
12-7-8: TINY HOUSE SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   General: Tiny house planned unit developments shall be subject to
requirements outlined in the zoning ordinance and also subject to all
provisions within this section. This section intends that tiny home
subdivisions create a highly vegetated, park-like environment, where the
emphasis is placed on minimalist living. This section only allows for tiny
homes on permanent foundations and does not allow tiny homes on wheels (THOWs).
THOWs are encouraged and accommodated in the City of Blackfoot in designated RV
subdivision developments.
Benefits sought by this section are: increased housing stock, increased
affordable housing, facilitating intergenerational living, attracting new
residents, increased Municipal revenue, supporting vulnerable populations, and
generally providing residents with more lifestyle freedom. Infill of
underdeveloped single-family areas of the City is considered a strong benefit
of tiny house subdivision.
   B.   Site Development Plan: The developer shall provide the Planning and
Zoning Commission with a colored rendering of adequate scale to show the
completed development that will include at least the following:
      1.   Building Envelopes/Lot Layout: Development density shall not exceed
fourteen (14) units per acre.
      2.   Required Design Standards: Allowed building materials and color/
finish schedules. The developer will provide a schedule of the proposed
materials to be allowed in the development along with color/finish schedules.
      3.   Perimeter Landscaping, Pathways, And Vegetation Plan: This plan
shall include vegetative buffers made up of a combination of trees, hedges,
bushes, and/or shrubbery providing privacy and a parklike environment around
the perimeter of the development. An engineered pathway system must be
integrated into this landscaping plan.
      4.   Individual Shade And Screening Plan: This plan shall include
vegetative buffers made up of a combination of trees, hedges, bushes, and
shrubbery providing privacy and separation between housing units and areas as
well as a landscaping plan including both trees and shrubbery around the
perimeter of the development.
      5.   Screened Garbage Collection Areas: Garbage collection areas must be
screened and gated by a decorative masonry wall and gate system.
      6.   Roads And Visitor Parking: Roads and common area visitor parking.
      7.   Designated Usable Open Space And Recreation Facilities: Open space
requirements will be governed by the maximum lot coverage requirements of the
individual overlying zone.
      8.   Utility Infrastructure: Designate locations for water, sewer, power,
maintenance building, and site drainage infrastructure.
This Site Development Plan must be reviewed and recommended for approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission before a preliminary plat application is
submitted.
   C.   Private Streets And Pathways: Private street construction standards
shall be based upon recommendations from the City Public Works and Fire
Department. Streets will meet minimum access standards. Construction standards
may vary depending on the location and size of the development and the demands
placed on such improvements. Roads are anticipated to be constructed with a
reduced street section that may or may not include curb and gutter. A Site
Drainage Plan is required. An engineered Pedestrian Pathway System is required
and replaces the City sidewalk requirement. Generally, parking will not be
allowed on streets or access ways other than in approved turnouts and other
common parking areas.
   D.   Homeowners' Association: Homeowners' association bylaws and other deed
restrictions, which provide for the control and maintenance of all common
areas, recreation facilities, and open space, shall be submitted and be
approved by the City.
   E.   Storage Areas: Screened storage areas or lots shall be provided for the
anticipated needs of boats, campers, and trailers - one (1) 220-square foot
space shall be provided for every three (3) living units.
   F.   Parking Space: One parking space of 12 feet x 22 feet is required for
each living unit, and an additional visitor parking space is needed for two (2)
dwelling units. These may be provided as distributed pullouts, or as a central
parking area/lot.
   G.   Maintenance Building: A maintenance building shall be provided, size
and location to be suitable for the service needs that are necessary for the
repair and maintenance of all common areas.
   H.   Open Space: The location of open space shall be appropriate to the
development and shall be of such shape and area to be usable and convenient to
the residents of the development. Open space requirements will comply with the
maximum lot coverage requirements of the applicable overlying zone.
   I.   Control During Development: Single ownership or control during
development shall be required and a time limit may be imposed to guarantee the
development is built and constructed as planned.
   J.   Lot Square Footage: Within a tiny house subdivision, lot square footage
shall be a minimum of the building footprint plus the one required parking area
of 12 feet x 22 feet. This parking area shall be paved upon application for a
building permit.
   K.   Plat And Public Hearing Requirements: Tiny house subdivisions will
follow all other requirements for platting and public hearing required by this
title, not in conflict with this section and although no minimum acreage for a
plat shall be required, tiny house subdivision plats are not anticipated to be
approved larger than twenty (20) acres. Tiny house subdivisions do not qualify
for a short plat subdivision process due to the statutory requirements of this
section requiring a new road system and other amenities. (Ord. 2175, 2-5-2019)

13-1-4: Administration
13-1-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
13-1-6: Variance And Appeal Procedures
13-1-7: Penalties For Violation
13-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, SEVERABILITY AND REPEAL
OF CONFLICTING PROVISIONS:
   A.   Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho by Idaho
Code sections 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorized local government units to
adopt a floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies
floodplains and that sets forth minimum development requirements in floodplains
that are designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of
its citizenry.
   B.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Require that development that is vulnerable to floods, including
structures and facilities necessary for the general health, safety and welfare
of citizens, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights,
velocities, or erosion;
      3.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development within the
area of special flood hazard which may increase flood damage or erosion;
      4.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands;
      5.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers that help to store or channel floodwaters.
   C.   Objectives: The objectives of this chapter are to:
      1.   Protect human life, health and property;
      2.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
purification and sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
      3.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas;
      4.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      6.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
   D.   Severability: If any provision of this chapter or its application to
any person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications
of this chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to that end the provisions of this chapter are severable.
   E.   Repeal Of Conflicting Provisions: Upon enactment of this chapter all
other ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith, are hereby
repealed. All sections of the aforementioned ordinances repealed by this
chapter shall remain in force as to the authorization and enforcement of said
ordinances prior to the effective date hereof.
   F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Blackfoot or by
any officer or employee thereof for flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or an administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2129,
3-3-2015)
13-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this

of provisions of this chapter or request for a variance.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Zone designations on FIRMs include the letters A, AE, V. Also known as the
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded each year. Also known as the "regulatory flood".
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The water surface elevation during the base flood
in relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation (BFE) is depicted on
the FIRM to the nearest foot and in the FIS to the nearest 0.1 foot.

subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BOARD: The elected governing city council of the city of Blackfoot, Idaho.
BUILDING: See definition of Structure.
DATUM: The vertical datum is a base measurement point (or set of points) from
which all elevations are determined. Historically, that common set of points
has been the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD29). The vertical
datum currently adopted by the federal government as a basis for measuring
heights is the North American vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures, or the construction of additions or substantial
improvements to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of
mobile homes; mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of materials;
specifically including the construction of dikes, berms and levees. The term
"development" does not include the operation, cleaning, maintenance or repair
of any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or
drainage works that is performed or authorized by the owner thereof pursuant to
lawful rights and obligations.
DIGITAL FIRM (DFIRM): Digital flood insurance rate map. It depicts flood risk
and zones and flood risk information. The DFIRM presents the flood risk
information in a format suitable for electronic mapping applications.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction"
commenced before November 15, 1979.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the "start of construction" commenced before November 15,
1979.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the national flood insurance program.
FLOOD FRINGE: The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway covered by
floodwaters during the regulatory flood.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, issued by the
federal insurance administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard
and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report by the federal insurance
administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles, floodway
boundaries and water surface elevations of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
   B.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation that corresponds to the
elevation of the one percent (1%) chance annual flood (base flood), plus any
increase in flood elevation due to proposed floodway encroachment, plus 0.1
foot of freeboard. Therefore the flood protection elevation for Bingham County
is equal to the BFE, plus proposed encroachment, plus 0.1 foot of freeboard.
FLOODPLAIN 1 : The land that has been or may be covered by floodwaters, or is
surrounded by floodwater and inaccessible, during the occurrence of the
regulatory flood. The riverine floodplain includes the floodway and the flood
fringe.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY/REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to discharge
and store the floodwater or flood flows associated with the regulatory flood
and delineated on the FIRM.
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety added above a BFE level for the purposes of
floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the hydrologic
effects of urbanization in a watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG): The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.
Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for HAG related to
building elevation information.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. department of interior) or preliminarily
determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the national register.
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or to a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify
as a registered historic district.
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have
been approved by the secretary of the interior, or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and
determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that
have been certified either:
      1. By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior, or
      2. Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved
programs.
LETTER OF MAP CORRECTIONS (LOMC): Official FEMA determination letters used to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are issued in the following
categories:
Conditional Letter Of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment by FEMA
as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum national flood
insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps,
or flood insurance studies.
Letter Of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data showing that
a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.
A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes
that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter Of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data showing that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination that a structure of parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG): The lowest point of the ground level next to the
structure. Refer to the elevation certificate, FEMA form 81-31, for LAG related
to building elevation information.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
used for living purposes, which includes working, storage, cooking and eating,
or recreation, or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could
be converted to such a use including a basement or crawl space. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a
structure's lowest floor. The lowest floor is a determinate for the flood
insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections built on
a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
NEW CONSTRUCTION: A structure for which the "start of construction" commenced
after November 15, 1979, and includes subsequent improvements to the structure.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A place where the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction
of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pad(s) is
completed on or after November 15, 1979).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis,
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection,
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towed by a light duty
truck, and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its market value before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
market value of the structure should be: a) the appraised value of the
structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or b) in the
case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This
term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual amount of repair work performed.
The term does not include either:
   A.   A project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the governing body from a requirement of this
chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American vertical
datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other specified datum) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 2129, 3-
3-2015)

the flood protection elevation is established, these standards for manufactured
homes and recreational vehicles that are an allowed use under the zoning
ordinance shall apply:
      1.   Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved:
         a.   On individual lots or parcels.
         b.   In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions.
         c.   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a
flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood
protection elevation.
      2.   Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to the
flood protection elevation or one foot (1') above the level of the base flood

or
      3.   The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new
construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements.
   F.   Floodway Standards: The following provisions shall apply in a floodway:
      1.   A project in the regulatory floodway must undergo an encroachment
review to determine its effect on flood flows. An encroachment analysis must
include:
         a.   Determination and documentation that the filling, grading or
construction of a structure will not obstruct flood flows and will not cause an
increase in flood heights upstream or adjacent to the project site;
         b.   Determination and documentation that grading, excavation, channel
improvements, bridge and culvert replacements that remove an obstruction, do
not cause increases in downstream flood flows;
         c.   Certification and documentation by a licensed professional
engineer that the project will not result in a rise in flood heights;
         d.   The administrator may make the encroachment determination for
minor projects, such as projects that do not increase the natural grade (e.g.,
paving a driveway or parking lot at existing grade, open fences and small
isolated obstructions such as a mailbox or telephone pole).
      2.   Upon demonstrating that there are no alternatives, the applicant may
propose an encroachment in the floodway that will cause an increase in the base
flood elevation in excess of the allowable level provided that the applicant
obtain a conditional letter of map revision from FEMA before the development
can be approved and permitted.
   G.   Standards For Zones With Base Flood Elevations: In special flood hazard
areas designated A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following
provisions are required:
      1.   New Residential Construction And Substantial Improvements:
         a.   Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction
or substantial improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, constructed at or above the
community's flood protection elevation.
         b.   If solid foundation perimeter walls are used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
subsection B4 of this section.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction or the substantial
improvement of any nonresidential structure located in zones A1-30, AE, or AH
must be floodproofed if the new construction or improvement is not elevated.
The structure and attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed
to be watertight to the flood protection elevation or to one foot (1') above
the base flood elevation, whichever is higher, with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect must certify that the
design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting these provisions, and shall provide certification to the
administrator.
      3.   Places Where Floodway Not Determined: Where the floodway has not
been determined, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted in zones A1-30 and AE on the
effective FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. Applicants of
proposed projects that increase the base flood elevation more than one foot
(1') are required to obtain and submit to the floodplain administrator, a
conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) preconstruction.
      4.   Postconstruction Application: Postconstruction, the applicant must
apply to FEMA for a letter of map revision for changes to the flood hazard map
proposed in the CLOMR.
      5.   Drainage Paths: In AH zones, drainage paths shall be provided to
guide floodwater around and away from proposed and existing structures.
   H.   Standards For Zones Without Base Flood Elevations And/Or Floodway (A
Zones): These standards apply in special flood hazard areas where streams exist
but no base flood elevation data have been provided (A zones), or where base
flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated.
      1.   When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been identified
by FEMA in a flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, then the
floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. If data
are not available from any source, only then provisions of subsections H2 and
H3 of this section shall apply.
         a.   Where the floodplain administrator has obtained base flood
elevation data, applicants of proposed projects that increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot (1') shall obtain a conditional letter of map
revision preconstruction and a letter of map revision postconstruction.
      2.   No encroachments, including structures or fill, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or fifty feet (50'), whichever
is greater, measured from the ordinary high water mark, unless certification by
a licensed professional engineer documents that the encroachment will not
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood.
      3.   In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new
construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or crawl space)
elevated no less than two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the construction standards in
subsections B and C of this section.
   I.   Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones): Shallow flooding
areas designated AO zones, are areas of special flood hazard that have base
flood depths of one to three feet (3'), with no clearly defined channel. The
following provisions apply:
      1.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated above the adjacent grade at least as high as the flood depth number
specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). If no flood depth
number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at
least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the construction standards in subsection B4 of this section.
      2.   New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential
structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure and attendant
utility and sanitary facilities must be designed to be watertight to the
specified base flood level or at least two feet (2') above highest adjacent
grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these
provisions, and shall provide certification to the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away
from all proposed and existing structures.
   J.   Alteration Of A Watercourse: A watercourse is considered altered when
any change occurs within its banks.
      1.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development and submit certification by a registered professional
engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not
be diminished.
      2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. army corps of engineers and the Idaho
department of water resources stream channel alteration program must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a water source. Evidence of
notification must be submitted to the floodplain administrator and to the
federal emergency management agency.
      3.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      4.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in subsections K1 and K2 of this section when an alteration of a watercourse
results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area,
including the placement of culverts.
   K.   Requirement To Submit New Technical Data:
      1.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         a.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         b.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area in accordance with subsection A3 of this section;
         c.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts;
         d.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
establishment of base flood elevations according to subsection A3 of this
section.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or
letter of map revision and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for
these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant. (Ord. 2129,
3-3-2015)
13-1-6: VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES:
   A.   Variance:
      1.   An application for a variance must be submitted to the floodplain
administrator on forms provided and include at a minimum the same information
required for a development permit and an explanation for the basis for the
variance request.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a variance, the variance
request will be set for a public hearing before the board.
      3.   Prior to the public hearing, notice of the hearing will be published
in the official newspaper at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. In
addition to the newspaper publication, written notice shall be provided to all
adjoining property owners by parcel post.
      4.   The burden to show that the variance is warranted and meets the
criteria set out herein is on the applicant.
   B.   Criteria For Variances:
      1.   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structure constructed below the base flood
level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   Variances may be issued upon:
         a.   A showing by the applicant of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances.
      5.   Variances pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants,
economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in
densely populated residential neighborhoods.
   C.   Variance Decision: The decision to either grant or deny a variance by
the board shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval
and denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on
notice along with the written decision that the permitted building will have
its lowest floor below the flood protection elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood damage
risk.
   D.   Appeals: The board shall hear and decide appeals from the
interpretations of the administrator.
      1.   An appeal must be filed with the administrator within fourteen (14)
days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the administrator.
Failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure to exhaust the
administrative remedies. The appeal must set out the interpretation of the
administrator and a narrative setting forth the facts relied upon by the
appellant and the appellant's claim regarding the error in the interpretation.
      2.   Upon receipt of a completed appeal, the appeal will be scheduled for
a public meeting to be heard by the board. The board shall consider the
following in ruling on an appeal:
         a.   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, including:
            (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;
            (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the individual landowner;
            (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
            (11)   The cost of providing government services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   E.   Decision: The board's decision on appeal shall be in writing and set
out the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
(Ord. 2129, 3-3-2015)
